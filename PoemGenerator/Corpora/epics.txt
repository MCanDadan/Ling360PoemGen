          lo the speardanes glory through splendid achievements
          the folkkings former fame we have heard of
          how princes displayed then their prowessinbattle



          oft scyld the scefing from scathers in numbers
         from many a people their meadbenches tore
          since first he found him friendless and wretched
          the earl had had terror comfort he got for it
          waxed neath the welkin worldhonor gained
          till all his neighbors oer sea were compelled to
        bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute
          an excellent atheling after was borne him



          a son and heir young in his dwelling
          whom godfather sent to solace the people
          he had marked the misery malice had caused them
        that reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile
          long been afflicted the lord in requital
          wielder of glory with worldhonor blessed him
          famed was beowulf far spread the glory
          of scylds great son in the lands of the danemen





        so the carle that is young by kindnesses rendered
          the friends of his father with fees in abundance
          must be able to earn that when age approacheth
          eager companions aid him requitingly
          when war assaults him serve him as liegemen
        by praiseworthy actions must honor be got
          mong all of the races at the hour that was fated



          scyld then departed to the allfathers keeping
          warlike to wend him away then they bare him
          to the flood of the current his fondloving comrades
        as himself he had bidden while the friend of the scyldings
          wordsway wielded and the welllovèd landprince
          long did rule them the ringstemmèd vessel
          bark of the atheling lay there at anchor
          icy in glimmer and eager for sailing



        the belovèd leader laid they down there
          giver of rings on the breast of the vessel
          the famed by the mainmast a many of jewels
          of fretted embossings from farlands brought over
          was placed near at hand then and heard i not ever
        that a folk ever furnished a float more superbly
          with weapons of warfare weeds for the battle
          bills and burnies on his bosom sparkled
          many a jewel that with him must travel
          on the flush of the flood afar on the current
        and favors no fewer they furnished him soothly
          excellent folkgems than others had given him



          who when first he was born outward did send him
          lone on the main the merest of infants
          and a goldfashioned standard they stretched under heaven
     high oer his head let the holmcurrents bear him
          seaward consigned him sad was their spirit
          their mood very mournful men are not able



          soothly to tell us they in halls who reside
          heroes under heaven to what haven he hied

   








          in the boroughs then beowulf bairn of the scyldings
          belovèd landprince for longlasting season
          was famed mid the folk  till afterward sprang
         greatminded healfdene the danes in his lifetime
          he graciously governed grimmooded agèd



          four bairns of his body born in succession
          woke in the world wartroopers leader
          heorogar hrothgar and halga the good
        heard i that elan was ongentheows consort



          the wellbeloved bedmate of the warscylfing leader
          then glory in battle to hrothgar was given
          waxing of warfame that willingly kinsmen
          obeyed his bidding till the boys grew to manhood
        a numerous band  it burned in his spirit
          to urge his folk to found a great building
          a meadhall grander than men of the era



          ever had heard of and in it to share
          with young and old all of the blessings
        the lord had allowed him save life and retainers
          then the work i find afar was assigned
       to many races in middleearths regions
          to adorn the great folkhall in due time it happened
          early mong men that twas finished entirely
        the greatest of hallbuildings heorot he named it



          who widereaching wordsway wielded mong earlmen
          his promise he brake not rings he lavished
          treasure at banquet towered the hall up
          high and horncrested huge between antlers
        it battlewaves bided the blasting firedemon
          ere long then from hottest hatred must swordwrath
          arise for a womans husband and father
          then the mighty warspirit endured for a season



          bore it bitterly he who bided in darkness
        that lighthearted laughter loud in the building
          greeted him daily there was dulcet harpmusic
          clear song of the singer he said that was able



          to tell from of old earthmens beginnings
          that father almighty earth had created
        the winsome wold that the water encircleth
          set exultingly the suns and the moons beams
          to lavish their lustre on landfolk and races
          and earth he embellished in all her regions
          with limbs and leaves life he bestowed too
        on all the kindreds that live under heaven



          so blessed with abundance brimming with joyance
          the warriors abided till a certain one gan to
          dog them with deeds of direfullest malice
          a foe in the hallbuilding this horrible stranger
        was grendel entitled the marchstepper famous
          who dwelt in the moorfens the marsh and the fastness
          the wanmooded being abode for a season
       in the land of the giants when the lord and creator
          had banned him and branded for that bitter murder
        the killing of abel allruling father



          the kindred of cain crushed with his vengeance
          in the feud he rejoiced not but far away drove him
          from kindred and kind that crime to atone for
          meter of justice thence illfavored creatures
        elves and giants monsters of ocean
          came into being and the giants that longtime
          grappled with god he gave them requital

 








          when the sun was sunken he set out to visit
          the lofty hallbuilding how the ringdanes had used it
          for beds and benches when the banquet was over
          then he found there reposing many a noble
         asleep after supper sorrow the heroes
          misery knew not the monster of evil
          greedy and cruel tarried but little



          fell and frantic and forced from their slumbers
          thirty of thanemen thence he departed
        leaping and laughing his lair to return to
          with surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward
          in the dusk of the dawning as the day was just breaking
          was grendels prowess revealed to the warriors



          then his mealtaking finished a moan was uplifted
        morningcry mighty the manruler famous
          the longworthy atheling sat very woful
          suffered great sorrow sighed for his liegemen
       when they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer
          the spirit accursèd too crushing that sorrow



        too loathsome and lasting not longer he tarried
          but one night after continued his slaughter
          shameless and shocking shrinking but little
          from malice and murder they mastered him fully
          he was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for
        a pleasanter place of repose in the lodges
          a bed in the bowers then was brought to his notice
          told him truly by token apparent
          the hallthanes hatred he held himself after
          further and faster who the foeman did baffle
        so ruled he and strongly strove against justice
          lone against all men till empty uptowered



          the choicest of houses long was the season
          twelvewinters time torture suffered
          the friend of the scyldings every affliction
        endless agony hence it after became
          certainly known to the children of men
          sadly in measures that long against hrothgar
          grendel struggledhis grudges he cherished
          murderous malice many a winter
        strife unremitting and peacefully wished he
          lifewoe to lift from no liegeman at all of
          the men of the danefolk for money to settle
          no counsellor needed count for a moment
       on handsome amends at the hands of the murderer



        the monster of evil fiercely did harass
          the illplanning deathshade both elder and younger
          trapping and tricking them he trod every night then
          the mistcovered moorfens men do not know where
          witches and wizards wander and ramble
        so the foe of mankind many of evils
          grievous injuries often accomplished
          horrible hermit heort he frequented
          gembedecked palace when nightshades had fallen



          
          twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the scyldings



          soulcrushing sorrow not seldom in private
          sat the king in his council conference held they
          what the braves should determine gainst terrors unlooked for



        at the shrines of their idols often they promised
          gifts and offerings earnestly prayed they
          the devil from hell would help them to lighten
          their peoples oppression such practice they used then
          hope of the heathen hell they remembered
        in innermost spirit god they knew not



          judge of their actions allwielding ruler
          no praise could they give the guardian of heaven
          the wielder of glory woe will be his who
          through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to
        the clutch of the fire no comfort shall look for
          wax no wiser well for the man who
          living his lifedays his lord may face
          and find defence in his fathers embrace

  







          so healfdenes kinsman constantly mused on
          his longlasting sorrow the battlethane clever
          was not anywise able evils to scape from
          too crushing the sorrow that came to the people
         loathsome and lasting the lifegrinding torture



          greatest of nightwoes so higelacs liegeman
          good amid geatmen of grendels achievements
          heard in his home of heroes then living
          he was stoutest and strongest sturdy and noble
        he bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty
          he said he the warking would seek oer the ocean
          the folkleader noble since he needed retainers
          for the perilous project prudent companions
          chided him little though loving him dearly
        they egged the brave atheling augured him glory



          the excellent knight from the folk of the geatmen
          had liegemen selected likest to prove them
          trustworthy warriors with fourteen companions
          the vessel he looked for a liegeman then showed them
        a seacrafty man the bounds of the country
          fast the days fleeted the float was awater
          the craft by the cliff clomb to the prow then
          wellequipped warriors the wavecurrents twisted
          the sea on the sand soldiers then carried
        on the breast of the vessel brightshining jewels
          handsome wararmor heroes outshoved then
          warmen the woodship on its wishedfor adventure





          the foamynecked floater fanned by the breeze
          likest a bird glided the waters



        till twenty and four hours thereafter
          the twiststemmed vessel had traveled such distance
          that the sailingmen saw the sloping embankments
          the sea cliffs gleaming precipitous mountains
          nesses enormous they were nearing the limits
        at the end of the ocean up thence quickly
          the men of the weders clomb to the mainland
          fastened their vessel  the wielder they thanked
          that the ways oer the waters had waxen so gentle



        then well from the cliff edge the guard of the scyldings
          who the seacliffs should see to saw oer the gangway
          brave ones bearing beauteous targets
          armor all ready anxiously thought he
          musing and wondering what men were approaching
        high on his horse then hrothgars retainer
          turned him to coastward mightily brandished
          his lance in his hands questioned with boldness



          who are ye men here mailcovered warriors
          clad in your corslets come thus adriving
        a high riding ship oer the shoals of the waters
          and hither neath helmets have hied oer the ocean
      i have been strandguard standing as warden
          lest enemies ever anywise ravage
          danish dominions with army of warships
        more boldly never have warriors ventured
          hither to come of kinsmens approval
          wordleave of warriors i ween that ye surely



          nothing have known never a greater one
          of earls oer the earth have _i_ had a sight of
        than is one of your number a hero in armor
          no lowranking fellow adorned with his weapons
          but launching them little unless looks are deceiving
          and striking appearance ere ye pass on your journey
          as treacherous spies to the land of the scyldings
        and farther fare i fully must know now
          what race ye belong to ye faraway dwellers
          seafaring sailors my simple opinion
          hear ye and hearken haste is most fitting
          plainly to tell me what place ye are come from

  







          the chief of the strangers rendered him answer
          wartroopers leader and wordtreasure opened

          and higelacs hearthfriends to heroes unnumbered

          ecgtheow titled many a winter
          he lived with the people ere he passed on his journey

          as we soothly heard say that some savage despoiler
          some hidden pursuer on nights that are murky
          by deeds very direful mid the danemen exhibits
          hatred unheard of horrid destruction
        and the falling of dead from feelings least selfish



          i am able to render counsel to hrothgar
          how he wise and worthy may worst the destroyer
          if the anguish of sorrow should ever be lessened
          comfort come to him and carewaves grow cooler
        or ever hereafter he agony suffer
          and troublous distress while towereth upward
          the handsomest of houses high on the summit



          bestriding his stallion the strandwatchman answered
          the doughty retainer the difference surely

          to warrior so great twill be granted sure
          in the storm of strife to stand secure

          then the battlebrave hero showed them the glittering
        court of the bold ones that they easily thither

          turning his courser quoth as he left them

          gainst hostile warriors as warden to stand








          the highway glistened with manyhued pebble
          a bypath led the liegemen together
          firm and handlocked the warburnie glistened
          the ringsword radiant rang mid the armor
         as the party was approaching the palace together



          in warlike equipments gainst the wall of the building
          their widefashioned warshields they weary did set then
      battleshields sturdy benchward they turned then
          their battlesarks rattled the gear of the heroes

          with edges of iron the armorclad troopers



          were decked with weapons then a proudmooded hero
          asked of the champions questions of lineage
        from what borders bear ye your battleshields plated
          gilded and gleaming your graycolored burnies

        men so many of mien more courageous
          i ween that from valor nowise as outlaws
          but from greatness of soul ye sought for king hrothgar



          then the strengthfamous earlman answer rendered
          the proudmooded wederchief replied to his question

          he turned then hurriedly where hrothgar was sitting
          old and hoary his earlmen attending him
          the strengthfamous went till he stood at the shoulder
        of the lord of the danemen of courteous thanemen

          when i came from the contest when covered with gore
          foes i escaped from where five i had bound
      the giantrace wasted in the waters destroying
        the nickers by night bore numberless sorrows
          the weders avenged 
          enemies ravaged alone now with grendel



          i shall manage the matter with the monster of evil
          the giant decide it thee i would therefore
        beg of thy bounty brightdanish chieftain
          lord of the scyldings this single petition
          not to refuse me defender of warriors
          friendlord of folks so far have i sought thee
          that _i_ may unaided my earlmen assisting me
        this bravemooded warband purify heorot
          i have heard on inquiry the horrible creature



          from veriest rashness recks not for weapons
          i this do scorn then so be higelac gracious
          my liegelord belovèd lenient of spirit
        to bear a blade or a broadfashioned target
          a shield to the onset only with handgrip



          the foe i must grapple fight for my life then
          foeman with foeman he fain must rely on
          the doom of the lord whom death layeth hold of



        i ween he will wish if he win in the struggle
          to eat in the warhall earls of the geatfolk
          boldly to swallow them as of yore he did often
          the best of the hrethmen thou needest not trouble
          a headwatch to give me he will have me dripping





        and dreary with gore if death overtake me

          find me my food if i fall in the battle
        send to higelac the armor that serveth
          to shield my bosom the best of equipments
          richest of ringmails tis the relic of hrethla



          the work of wayland goes weird as she must go

  







          hrothgar discoursed helm of the scyldings
          to defend our folk and to furnish assistance
          thou soughtest us hither good friend beowulf



          the fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in
         heatholaf killed he in handtohand conflict
          mid wilfingish warriors then the wederish people
          for fear of a feud were forced to disown him
          thence flying he fled to the folk of the southdanes
      the race of the scyldings oer the roll of the waters
        i had lately begun then to govern the danemen
          the hoardseat of heroes held in my youth
          rich in its jewels dead was heregar
          my kinsman and elder had earthjoys forsaken
          healfdene his bairn he was better than i am
        that feud thereafter for a fee i compounded
          oer the weltering waters to the wilfings i sent
          ornaments old oaths did he swear me



          it pains me in spirit to any to tell it
          what grief in heorot grendel hath caused me
        what horror unlookedfor by hatred unceasing
          waned is my warband wasted my halltroop
          weird hath offcast them to the clutches of grendel
          god can easily hinder the scather
          from deeds so direful oft drunken with beer



        oer the alevessel promised warriors in armor
          they would willingly wait on the wassailingbenches
          a grapple with grendel with grimmest of edges
          then this meadhall at morning with murder was reeking
          the building was bloody at breaking of daylight
        the benchdeals all flooded dripping and bloodied
          the folkhall was gory i had fewer retainers
          dearbeloved warriors whom death had laid hold of



          sit at the feast now thy intents unto heroes
          thy victorfame show as thy spirit doth urge thee



        for the men of the geats then together assembled
          in the beerhall blithesome a bench was made ready
          there warlike in spirit they went to be seated
          proud and exultant a liegeman did service
      who a beaker embellished bore with decorum



        and gleamingdrink poured the gleeman sang whilom



          hearty in heorot there was heroes rejoicing
          a numerous warband of weders and danemen

   



          unferth spoke up ecglaf his son
          who sat at the feet of the lord of the scyldings
          opened the jousting 



          art thou that beowulf with breca did struggle
          on the wide seacurrents at swimming contended
        where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried



          from vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
          in care of the waters and no one was able
          nor lief nor loth one in the least to dissuade you
          your difficult voyage then ye ventured aswimming
        where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover
          the mereways measured mixing and stirring them
          glided the ocean angry the waves were
          with the weltering of winter in the waters possession
          ye toiled for a sevennight he at swimming outdid thee
        in strength excelled thee then early at morning
          on the heathoremes shore the holmcurrents tossed him
          sought he thenceward the home of his fathers
          beloved of his liegemen the land of the brondings
          the peacecastle pleasant where a people he wielded
    had borough and jewels the pledge that he made thee



          the son of beanstan hath soothly accomplished
          then i ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue



          though ever triumphant in onset of battle
          a grim grappling if grendel thou darest
        for the space of a night nearby to wait for



          beowulf answered offspring of ecgtheow
          my good friend unferth sure freely and wildly



          thou fuddled with beer of breca hast spoken
          hast told of his journey a fact i allege it
        that greater strength in the waters i had then
          ills in the ocean than any man else had
          we made agreement as the merest of striplings
          promised each other  that we yet would adventure
        out on the ocean it all we accomplished
          while swimming the seafloods swordblade unscabbarded
          boldly we brandished our bodies expected
          to shield from the sharks he sure was unable



          to swim on the waters further than i could
        more swift on the waves nor _would_ i from him go
          then we two companions stayed in the ocean



          five nights together till the currents did part us
          the weltering waters weathers the bleakest
          and nethermost night and the northwind whistled
        fierce in our faces fell were the billows
          the mere fishes mood was mightily ruffled
          and there against foemen my firmknotted corslet
          handjointed hardy help did afford me
          my battlesark braided brilliantly gilded



        lay on my bosom to the bottom then dragged me
          a hateful fiendscather seized me and held me
          grim in his grapple twas granted me nathless
          to pierce the monster with the point of my weapon
          my obedient blade battle offcarried
        the mighty merecreature by means of my handblow





          so illmeaning enemies often did cause me
          sorrow the sorest i served them in quittance



          with my dearlovèd sword as in sooth it was fitting
          they missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly
         illdoers evil of eating my body
          of surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean
          but wounded with edges early at morning
          they were stretched ahigh on the strand of the ocean



          put to sleep with the sword that seagoing travelers
        no longer thereafter were hindered from sailing
          the foamdashing currents came a light from the east
          gods beautiful beacon the billows subsided
          that well i could see the nesses projecting



          the blustering crags weird often saveth
        the undoomed hero if doughty his valor
          but me did it fortune to fell with my weapon
          nine of the nickers of nightstruggle harder
          neath dome of the heaven heard i but rarely
          nor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean
        yet i scaped with my life the grip of the monsters



          weary from travel then the waters bare me
          to the land of the finns the flood with the current



          the weltering waves not a word hath been told me
          of deeds so daring done by thee unferth
        and of swordterror none never hath breca
          at the play of the battle nor either of you two
          feat so fearless performèd with weapons
          glinting and gleaming            
                  i utter no boasting



        though with coldblooded cruelty thou killedst thy brothers
          thy nearest of kin thou needs must in hell get
          direful damnation though doughty thy wisdom
          i tell thee in earnest offspring of ecglaf
          never had grendel such numberless horrors
        the direful demon done to thy liegelord
          harrying in heorot if thy heart were as sturdy



          thy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them
          he hath found out fully that the fierceburning hatred
          the edgebattle eager of all of your kindred
        of the victoryscyldings need little dismay him
          oaths he exacteth not any he spares



          of the folk of the danemen but fighteth with pleasure
          killeth and feasteth no contest expecteth



          from speardanish people but the prowess and valor
        of the earls of the geatmen early shall venture
          to give him a grapple he shall go who is able
          bravely to banquet when the brightlight of morning



          which the second day bringeth the sun in its etherrobes
          oer children of men shines from the southward
        then the grayhaired warfamed giver of treasure



          was blithesome and joyous the brightdanish ruler
          expected assistance the peoples protector



          heard from beowulf his bold resolution
          there was laughter of heroes loud was the clatter
        the words were winsome wealhtheow advanced then



          consort of hrothgar of courtesy mindful
          golddecked saluted the men in the building
          and the freeborn woman the beaker presented



          to the lord of the kingdom first of the eastdanes
        bade him be blithesome when beer was aflowing
          lief to his liegemen he lustily tasted
          of banquet and beaker battlefamed ruler
          the helmingish lady then graciously circled
          mid all the liegemen lesser and greater





        treasurecups tendered till time was afforded
          that the decorousmooded diademed folkqueen



          might bear to beowulf the bumper oerrunning
          she greeted the geatprince god she did thank
          most wise in her words that her wish was accomplished
        that in any of earlmen she ever should look for
          solace in sorrow he accepted the beaker
          battlebold warrior at wealhtheows giving



          then equipped for combat quoth he in measures
          beowulf spake offspring of ecgtheow
        i purposed in spirit when i mounted the ocean



          when i boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen
          i would work to the fullest the will of your people
          or in foesclutches fastened fall in the battle
          deeds i shall do of daring and prowess
        or the last of my lifedays live in this meadhall
          these words to the lady were welcome and pleasing
          the boast of the geatman with gold trappings broidered
          went the freeborn folkqueen her fondlord to sit by



          then again as of yore was heard in the building
        courtly discussion conquerors shouting
          heroes were happy till healfdenes son would
          go to his slumber to seek for refreshing
          for the horrid hellmonster in the hallbuilding knew he
          a fight was determined since the light of the sun they
        no longer could see and lowering darkness
          oer all had descended and dark under heaven
          shadowy shapes came shying around them



          the liegemen all rose then one saluted the other
          hrothgar beowulf in rhythmical measures
        wishing him well and the wassailhall giving
          to his care and keeping quoth he departing
      not to any one else have i ever entrusted
          but thee and thee only the hall of the danemen
          since high i could heave my hand and my buckler
       take thou in charge now the noblest of houses
          be mindful of honor exhibiting prowess
          watch gainst the foeman thou shalt want no enjoyments
          survive thou safely adventure so glorious





          then hrothgar departed his earlthrong attending him
          folklord of scyldings forth from the building
          the warchieftain wished then wealhtheow to look for
          the queen for a bedmate to keep away grendel



         the glory of kings had given a hallwatch
          as men heard recounted for the king of the danemen
          he did special service gave the giant a watcher
          and the prince of the geatmen implicitly trusted



          his warlike strength and the wielders protection



        his armor of iron off him he did then
          his helmet from his head to his henchman committed
          his chasedhandled chainsword choicest of weapons
          and bade him bide with his battleequipments
          the good one then uttered words of defiance
        beowulf geatman ere his bed he upmounted



          i hold me no meaner in matters of prowess
          in warlike achievements than grendel does himself
          hence i seek not with swordedge to sooth him to slumber
          of life to bereave him though well i am able



        no battleskill has he that blows he should strike me
          to shatter my shield though sure he is mighty
      in strife and destruction but struggling by night we
          shall do without edges dare he to look for
          weaponless warfare and wisemooded father
        the glory apportion god everholy



          on which hand soever to him seemeth proper
          then the bravemooded hero bent to his slumber
          the pillow received the cheek of the noble



          and many a martial merethane attending
        sank to his slumber seemed it unlikely



          that ever thereafter any should hope to
          be happy at home herofriends visit
          or the lordly troopcastle where he lived from his childhood
          they had heard how slaughter had snatched from the winehall
        had recently ravished of the race of the scyldings



          too many by far but the lord to them granted
          the weaving of warspeed to wederish heroes
          aid and comfort that every opponent
          by one mans warmight they worsted and vanquished



        by the might of himself the truth is established
          that god almighty hath governed for ages
          kindreds and nations a night very lurid



          the travlerattwilight came tramping and striding
          the warriors were sleeping who should watch the hornedbuilding



        one only excepted mid earthmen twas stablished
          th implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them
          to the land of shadows if the lord were unwilling
          but serving as warder in terror to foemen
          he angrily bided the issue of battle





          neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then
          grendel going gods anger bare he
          the monster intended some one of earthmen
          in the hallbuilding grand to entrap and make way with



         he went under welkin where well he knew of
          the winejoyous building brilliant with plating
          goldhall of earthmen not the earliest occasion



          he the home and manor of hrothgar had sought
          neer found he in lifedays later nor earlier
        hardier hero hallthanes more sturdy
          then came to the building the warrior marching



          bereft of his joyance the door quickly opened
          on firehinges fastened when his fingers had touched it
          the fell one had flung thenhis fury so bitter
        open the entrance early thereafter
          the foeman trod the shining hallpavement



          strode he angrily from the eyes of him glimmered
          a lustre unlovely likest to fire
          he beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers
        a circle of kinsmen sleeping together



          a throng of thanemen then his thoughts were exultant
          he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen
          the life from his body horrible demon
          ere morning came since fate had allowed him



        the prospect of plenty providence willed not
          to permit him any more of men under heaven
          to eat in the nighttime higelacs kinsman
          great sorrow endured how the diremooded creature
      in unlookedfor assaults were likely to bear him
        no thought had the monster of deferring the matter



          but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of
          a soldier asleep suddenly tore him
          bit his boneprison the blood drank in currents
          swallowed in mouthfuls he soon had the dead mans
        feet and hands too eaten entirely
          nearer he strode then the stouthearted warrior



          snatched as he slumbered seizing with handgrip
          forward the foeman foined with his hand
          caught he quickly the cunning deviser
        on his elbow he rested this early discovered
          the master of malice that in middleearths regions
          neath the whole of the heavens no handgrapple greater



          in any man else had he ever encountered
          fearful in spirit faintmooded waxed he
        not off could betake him death he was pondering



          would fly to his covert seek the devils assembly
          his calling no more was the same he had followed
          long in his lifetime the liegekinsman worthy



          of higelac minded his speech of the evening
        stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him
          his fingers crackled the giant was outward
          the earl stepped farther the famous one minded
          to flee away farther if he found an occasion
          and off and away avoiding delay
        to fly to the fenmoors he fully was ware of
          the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman



          twas an illtaken journey that the injurybringing
          harrying harmer to heorot wandered



          the palace reechoed to all of the danemen
        dwellers in castles to each of the bold ones
          earlmen was terror angry they both were
          archwarders raging rattled the building
      twas a marvellous wonder that the winehall withstood then
          the boldinbattle bent not to earthward
        excellent earthhall but within and without it
          was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron
          by the art of the armorer off from the sill there
          bent meadbenches many as men have informed me
          adorned with goldwork where the grim ones did struggle
        the scylding wise men weened neer before
          that by might and mainstrength a man under heaven
          might break it in pieces bonedecked resplendent
          crush it by cunning unless clutch of the fire
          in smoke should consume it the sound mounted upward



        novel enough on the north danes fastened
          a terror of anguish on all of the men there
          who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining
          the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven
          heard him hymns of horror howl and his sorrow
        hellbound bewailing he held him too firmly
          who was strongest of mainstrength of men of that era





          for no cause whatever would the earlmens defender
          leave in lifejoys the loathsome newcomer
          he deemed his existence utterly useless
          to men under heaven many a noble
         of beowulf brandished his battlesword old
          would guard the life of his lord and protector
          the farfamous chieftain if able to do so
          while waging the warfare this wist they but little
          brave battlethanes while his body intending



        to slit into slivers and seeking his spirit
          that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons
          of all on the earth nor any of warbills
      was willing to injure but weapons of victory
          swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with
        his death at that time must prove to be wretched
          and the faraway spirit widely should journey
          into enemies power this plainly he saw then
          who with mirth of mood malice no little
          had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen
         that his body would fail him
          but higelacs hardy henchman and kinsman
          held him by the hand hateful to other



          was each one if living a bodywound suffered
          the direful demon damage incurable



        was seen on his shoulder his sinews were shivered
          his body did burst to beowulf was given
          glory in battle grendel from thenceward
          must flee and hide him in the fencliffs and marshes
          sick unto death his dwelling must look for
        unwinsome and woful he wist the more fully



          the end of his earthly existence was nearing
          his lifedays limits at last for the danemen
          when the slaughter was over their wish was accomplished
          the comerfromfarland had cleansed then of evil
        wise and valiant the warhall of hrothgar
          saved it from violence he joyed in the nightwork
          in repute for prowess the prince of the geatmen
          for the eastdanish people his boast had accomplished
          bettered their burdensome balesorrows fully
        the craftbegot evil they erstwhile had suffered
          and were forced to endure from crushing oppression
          their manifold misery twas a manifest token



          when the heroinbattle the hand suspended
          the arm and the shoulder  neath greatstretching hallroof





          in the mist of the morning many a warrior
          stood round the gifthall as the story is told me
          folkprinces fared then from far and from near
          through longstretching journeys to look at the wonder
         the footprints of the foeman few of the warriors



          who gazed on the foottracks of the inglorious creature
          his parting from life pained very deeply
          how weary in spirit off from those regions
          in combats conquered he carried his traces
        fated and flying to the flood of the nickers



          there in bloody billows bubbled the currents
          the angry eddy was everywhere mingled
          and seething with gore welling with swordblood
          he deathdoomed had hid him when reaved of his joyance
        he laid down his life in the lair he had fled to
          his heathenish spirit where hell did receive him
          thence the friends from of old backward turned them
          and many a younker from merry adventure
          striding their stallions stout from the seaward
        heroes on horses there were heard very often



          beowulfs praises many often asserted
          that neither south nor north in the circuit of waters



          oer outstretching earthplain none other was better
          mid bearers of warshields more worthy to govern

          of hrothgar the gracious 
          oft the famed ones permitted their fallowskinned horses
      to run in rivalry racing and chasing
        where the fieldways appeared to them fair and inviting
          known for their excellence oft a thane of the folklord



          a man of celebrity mindful of rhythms
          who ancient traditions treasured in memory
          new wordgroups found properly bound
        the bard after gan then beowulfs venture



          wisely to tell of and words that were clever
          to utter skilfully earnestly speaking
          everything told he that he heard as to sigmunds



          mighty achievements many things hidden
        the strife of the wælsing the widegoing ventures
          the children of men knew of but little
          the feud and the fury but fitela with him
          when suchlike matters he minded to speak of
          uncle to nephew as in every contention
        each to other was ever devoted
          a numerous host of the race of the scathers
          they had slain with the swordedge to sigmund accrued then
          no little of glory when his lifedays were over
          since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon
        the hoardtreasures keeper neath the hoargrayish stone he
          the son of the atheling unaided adventured
          the perilous project not present was fitela
          yet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon
          through the marvellous dragon that it stood in the wall
        wellhonored weapon the worm was slaughtered
          the great one had gained then by his glorious achievement
          to reap from the ringhoard richest enjoyment
      as best it did please him his vessel he loaded
          shining ornaments on the ships bosom carried
        kinsman of wæls the drake in heat melted



          he was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims
          mid widescattered worldfolk for works of great prowess
          wartroopers shelter hence waxed he in honor



          afterward heremods herostrength failed him
        his vigor and valor mid venomous haters
          to the hands of foemen he was foully delivered
          offdriven early agonybillows



          oppressed him too long to his people he became then
          to all the athelings an evergreat burden
        and the daring ones journey in days of yore
          many wise men were wont to deplore
          such as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow
          that the son of their ruler should rise into power
          holding the headship held by his fathers
        should govern the people the goldhoard and borough
          the kingdom of heroes the realm of the scyldings



          he to all men became then far more beloved
          higelacs kinsman to kindreds and races
          to his friends much dearer him malice assaulted



        oft running and racing on roadsters they measured
          the duncolored highways then the light of the morning
          was hurried and hastened went henchmen in numbers
          to the beautiful building bold ones in spirit
          to look at the wonder the liegelord himself then
        from his wifebower wending warden of treasures
          glorious trod with troopers unnumbered
          famed for his virtues and with him the queenwife
          measured the meadways with maidens attending




          hrothgar discoursed 



          for the sight we behold now thanks to the wielder
         early be offered much evil i bided
          snaring from grendel god can eer complish
          wonder on wonder wielder of glory



          but lately i reckoned neer under heaven
          comfort to gain me for any of sorrows
        while the handsomest of houses horrid with bloodstain
          gory uptowered grief had offfrightened
          each of the wise ones who weened not that ever
          the folktroops defences gainst foes they should strengthen
          gainst sprites and monsters through the might of the wielder
        a doughty retainer hath a deed now accomplished
          which erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom



          failed to perform may affirm very truly
          what woman soever in all of the nations
          gave birth to the child if yet she surviveth
        that the longruling lord was lavish to herward
          in the birth of the bairn now beowulf dear



          most excellent hero ill love thee in spirit
          as bairn of my body bear well henceforward
          the relationship new no lack shall befall thee
        of earthjoys any i ever can give thee
          full often for lesser service ive given
      hero less hardy hoardtreasure precious



          to a weaker in warstrife by works of distinction
          thou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish
        forever and ever the allruler quite thee
          with good from his hand as he hitherto did thee



          beowulf answered ecgtheows offspring
          that labor of glory most gladly achieved we
          the combat accomplished unquailing we ventured
        the enemys grapple i would grant it much rather
          thou wert able to look at the creature in person
          faint unto falling the foe in his trappings
          on murderbed quickly i minded to bind him
          with firmholding fetters that forced by my grapple
        low he should lie in lifeanddeath struggle
          less his body escape i was wholly unable



          since god did not will it to keep him from going
          not held him that firmly hated opposer
          too swift was the foeman yet safety regarding
        he suffered his hand behind him to linger
          his arm and shoulder to act as watcher



          no shadow of solace the woebegone creature
          found him there nathless the hated destroyer
          liveth no longer lashed for his evils
        but sorrow hath seized him in snaremeshes hath him
          close in its clutches keepeth him writhing
          in baleful bonds there banished for evil
          the man shall wait for the mighty tribunal



          how the god of glory shall give him his earnings
        then the soldier kept silent son of old ecglaf



          from boasting and bragging of battleachievements
          since the princes beheld there the hand that depended
          neath the lofty halltimbers by the might of the nobleman
          each one before him the enemys fingers
        each fingernail strong steel most resembled
          the heathen ones handspur the heroinbattles
          claw most uncanny quoth they agreeing





          that not any excellent edges of brave ones
          was willing to touch him the terrible creatures
        battlehand bloody to bear away from him






          then straight was ordered that heorot inside
          with hands be embellished a host of them gathered
          of men and women who the wassailingbuilding
          the guesthall begeared goldflashing sparkled
         webs on the walls then of wonders a many
          to each of the heroes that look on such objects



          the beautiful building was broken to pieces
          which all within with irons was fastened
          its hinges torn off only the roof was
        whole and uninjured when the horrible creature
          outlawed for evil off had betaken him
          hopeless of living tis hard to avoid it



           but he doubtless must come to
          the place awaiting as wyrd hath appointed
        soulbearers earthdwellers earls under heaven
          where bound on its bed his body shall slumber



          when feasting is finished full was the time then
          that the son of healfdene went to the building
      the excellent atheling would eat of the banquet
        neer heard i that people with heroband larger
          bare them better towrds their braceletbestower
          the ladenwithglory stooped to the bench then
          
        doughty of spirit in the hightowring palace



          hrothgar and hrothulf heorot then inside
          was filled with friendly ones falsehood and treachery
          the folkscyldings now nowise did practise



          then the offspring of healfdene offered to beowulf
        a golden standard as reward for the victory
          a banner embossed burnie and helmet
          many men saw then a songfamous weapon
          borne fore the hero beowulf drank of
          the cup in the building that treasurebestowing
        he needed not blush for in battlemens presence



          neer heard i that many men on the alebench
          in friendlier fashion to their fellows presented
          four bright jewels with goldwork embellished
          round the roof of the helmet a headguarder outside
        braided with wires with bosses was furnished
          that swordsforthebattle fighthardened might fail
          boldly to harm him when the hero proceeded



          forth against foemen the defender of earls then
          commanded that eight steeds with bridles
        goldplated gleaming be guided to hallward
          inside the building on one of them stood then
          an artbroidered saddle embellished with jewels
          twas the sovereigns seat when the son of king healfdene
          was pleased to take part in the play of the edges
        the famous ones valor neer failed at the front when
          slain ones were bowing and to beowulf granted
          the prince of the ingwins power over both
          oer warsteeds and weapons bade him well to enjoy them
          in so manly a manner the mightyfamed chieftain
    hoardward of heroes with horses and jewels
          warstorms requited that none eer condemneth
          who willeth to tell truth with full justice






          and the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes
          who the ways of the waters went with beowulf
          a costly gifttoken gave on the meadbench
          offered an heirloom and ordered that that man



         with gold should be paid for whom grendel had erstwhile
          wickedly slaughtered as he more of them had done
          had farseeing god and the mood of the hero
          the fate not averted the father then governed
          all of the earthdwellers as he ever is doing
        hence insight for all men is everywhere fittest
          forethought of spirit much he shall suffer
          of lief and of loathsome who long in this present
          useth the world in this woful existence
          there was music and merriment mingling together



        touching healfdenes leader the joywood was fingered
          measures recited when the singer of hrothgar
          on meadbench should mention the merry halljoyance
          of the kinsmen of finn when onset surprised them



          the halfdanish hero hnæf of the scyldings
        on the field of the frisians was fated to perish
          sure hildeburg needed not mention approving
          the faith of the jutemen though blameless entirely



          when shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings
          of bairns and brothers they bent to their fate
        with warspear wounded woe was that woman
          not causeless lamented the daughter of hoce
          the decree of the wielder when morninglight came and
          she was able neath heaven to behold the destruction
      of brothers and bairns where the brightest of earthjoys



        she had hitherto had all the henchmen of finn
          war had offtaken save a handful remaining
          that he nowise was able to offer resistance



          to the onset of hengest in the parley of battle
          nor the wretched remnant to rescue in war from
        the earl of the atheling but they offered conditions



          another great building to fully make ready
          a hall and a highseat that half they might rule with
          the sons of the jutemen and that folcwaldas son would
          day after day the danemen honor
        when gifts were giving and grant of his ringstore
          to hengests earltroop ever so freely
          of his goldplated jewels as he encouraged the frisians



          on the bench of the beerhall on both sides they swore then
          a fastbinding compact finn unto hengest
        with no thought of revoking vowed then most solemnly
          the woebegone remnant well to take charge of
          his witan advising the agreement should no one
          by words or works weaken and shatter
          by artifice ever injure its value
        though reaved of their ruler their ringgivers slayer
          they followed as vassals fate so requiring



          then if one of the frisians the quarrel should speak of
          in tones that were taunting terrible edges
          should cut in requital accomplished the oath was
        and treasure of gold from the hoard was uplifted



          the best of the scylding braves was then fully
          prepared for the pile at the pyre was seen clearly
          the bloodgory burnie the boar with his gilding
          the ironhard swine athelings many
        fatally wounded no few had been slaughtered
          hildeburg bade then at the burning of hnæf





          the bairn of her bosom to bear to the fire
          that his body be burned and borne to the pyre
          the woestricken woman wept on his shoulder
        in measures lamented upmounted the hero
          the greatest of deadfires curled to the welkin
          on the hillsfront crackled heads were amelting
          wounddoors bursting while the blood was acoursing
          from bodybite fierce the fire devoured them
        greediest of spirits whom war had offcarried
          from both of the peoples their bravest were fallen






          then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings
          reaved of their friends friesland to visit
          their homes and highcity hengest continued



          biding with finn the bloodtainted winter
         wholly unsundered of fatherland thought he
          though unable to drive the ringstemmèd vessel
      oer the ways of the waters the wavedeeps were tossing
          fought with the wind winter in icebonds
          closed up the currents till there came to the dwelling
        a year in its course as yet it revolveth
          if season propitious one alway regardeth
          worldcheering weathers then winter was gone
          earths bosom was lovely the exile would get him



          the guest from the palace on grewsomest vengeance
        he brooded more eager than on oversea journeys
          wher onsetofanger he were able to complish
          the bairns of the jutemen therein to remember
          nowise refused he the duties of liegeman
          when hun of the frisians the battlesword láfing
        fairest of falchions friendly did give him
          its edges were famous in folktalk of jutland
          and savage swordfury seized in its clutches

          when the grewsome grapple guthlaf and oslaf
        had mournfully mentioned the merejourney over
          for sorrows halfblamed him the flickering spirit
          could not bide in his bosom then the building was covered



          with corpses of foemen and finn too was slaughtered
          the king with his comrades and the queen made a prisoner



        the troops of the scyldings bore to their vessels
          all that the landking had in his palace
          such trinkets and treasures they took as on searching
          at finns they could find they ferried to daneland
          the excellent woman on oversea journey



        led her to their landfolk the lay was concluded

        uncle and nephew their peace was yet mutual
          true each to the other and unferth the spokesman
          sat at the feet of the lord of the scyldings
          each trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous
          though at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen
        said the queen of the scyldings my lord and protector

          what favors of yore when he yet was an infant

          then she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing

          they sank then to slumber with sorrow one paid for

         death for his sins twas seen very clearly



          known unto earthfolk that still an avenger
          outlived the loathed one long since the sorrow
          caused by the struggle the mother of grendel
          devilshaped woman her woe ever minded
        who was held to inhabit the horrible waters



          the coldflowing currents after cain had become a
          slayerwithedges to his one only brother
          the son of his sire he set out then banished
          marked as a murderer manjoys avoiding
        lived in the desert thence demons unnumbered



          fatesent awoke one of them grendel
          swordcursèd hateful who at heorot met with
          a man that was watching waiting the struggle
          where a horrid one held him with handgrapple sturdy
        nathless he minded the might of his body
          the glorious gift god had allowed him
          and folkruling fathers favor relied on
          his help and his comfort so he conquered the foeman
          the hellspirit humbled he unhappy departed then
        reaved of his joyance journeying to deathhaunts
          foeman of man his mother moreover



          eager and gloomy was anxious to go on
          her mournful mission mindful of vengeance
          for the death of her son she came then to heorot
    where the armordane earlmen all through the building
          were lying in slumber soon there became then
          return to the nobles when the mother of grendel
          entered the folkhall the fear was less grievous
          by even so much as the vigor of maidens
        warstrength of women by warrior is reckoned
          when wellcarved weapon worked with the hammer
          blade very bloody brave with its edges
          strikes down the boarsign that stands on the helmet
          then the hardedgèd weapon was heaved in the building
        the brand oer the benches broadlindens many
          handfast were lifted for helmet he recked not
          for armornet broad whom terror laid hold of
          she went then hastily outward would get her
          her life for to save when some one did spy her



        soon she had grappled one of the athelings
          fast and firmly when fenward she hied her
          that one to hrothgar was liefest of heroes
          in rank of retainer where waters encircle
          a mighty shieldwarrior whom she murdered at slumber
        a broadlyfamed battleknight beowulf was absent



          but another apartment was erstwhile devoted
          to the glorydecked geatman when gold was distributed
          there was hubbub in heorot the hand that was famous
          she grasped in its gore grief was renewed then
    in homes and houses twas no happy arrangement
          in both of the quarters to barter and purchase
          with lives of their friends then the wellagèd ruler
          the grayheaded warthane was woful in spirit
          when his longtrusted liegeman lifeless he knew of



        his dearest one gone quick from a room was
          beowulf brought brave and triumphant
          as day was dawning in the dusk of the morning



          went then that earlman champion noble
          came with comrades where the clever one bided
        whether god all gracious would grant him a respite
          after the woe he had suffered the warworthy hero
          with a troop of retainers trod then the pavement
           till he greeted the wise one



          the earl of the ingwins asked if the night had
        fully refreshed him as fain he would have it










          hrothgar rejoined helm of the scyldings
          ask not of joyance grief is renewed to
          the folk of the danemen dead is æschere
          yrmenlafs brother older than he
         my truehearted counsellor trusty adviser
          shouldercompanion when fighting in battle
          our heads we protected when troopers were clashing



          and heroes were dashing such an earl should be ever
          an erstworthy atheling as æschere proved him
        the flickering deathspirit became in heorot
          his handtohand murderer i can not tell whither
          the cruel one turned in the carcass exulting





          by cramming discovered the quarrel she wreaked then
          that last night igone grendel thou killedst
        in grewsomest manner with grimholding clutches
          since too long he had lessened my liegetroop and wasted
          my folkmen so foully he fell in the battle
          with forfeit of life and another has followed
          a mighty crimeworker her kinsman avenging
        and henceforth hath stablished her hatred unyielding
          as it well may appear to many a liegeman
          who mourneth in spirit the treasurebestower
          her heavy heartsorrow the hand is now lifeless
          which availed you in every wish that you cherished



        landpeople heard i liegemen this saying
          dwellers in halls they had seen very often
          a pair of such mighty marchstriding creatures
          fardwelling spirits holding the moorlands
          one of them wore as well they might notice
        the image of woman the other one wretched
          in guise of a man wandered in exile
          except he was huger than any of earthmen
          earthdwelling people entitled him grendel
          in days of yore they know not their father
        wher illgoing spirits any were borne him



          ever before they guard the wolfcoverts
          lands inaccessible windbeaten nesses
          fearfullest fendeeps where a flood from the mountains
          neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles
        the stream under earth not far is it henceward
          measured by milelengths that the merewater standeth
          which forests hang over with frostwhiting covered
      a firmrooted forest the floods overshadow
          there ever at night one an illmeaning portent
        a fireflood may see mong children of men
          none liveth so wise that wot of the bottom
          though harassed by hounds the heathstepper seek for



          fly to the forest firmantlered hedeer
          spurred from afar his spirit he yieldeth
        his life on the shore ere in he will venture
          to cover his head uncanny the place is
          thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters
          wan to the welkin when the wind is stirring
          the weathers unpleasing till the air groweth gloomy



        and the heavens lower now is help to be gotten
          from thee and thee only the abode thou knowst not
          the dangerous place where thourt able to meet with
          the sinladen hero seek if thou darest
          for the feud i will fully fee thee with money
        with oldtime treasure as erstwhile i did thee
          with welltwisted jewels if away thou shalt get thee



          beowulf answered ecgtheows son



          grieve not o wise one for each it is better
          his friend to avenge than with vehemence wail him
          each of us must the endday abide of
         his earthly existence who is able accomplish
          glory ere death to battlethane noble
          lifeless lying tis at last most fitting
          arise o king quick let us hasten
          to look at the footprint of the kinsman of grendel
        i promise thee this now to his place hell escape not
          to embrace of the earth nor to mountainous forest
          nor to depths of the ocean wherever he wanders
      practice thou now patient endurance
          of each of thy sorrows as i hope for thee soothly



        then up sprang the old one the allwielder thanked he
          ruler almighty that the man had outspoken
          then for hrothgar a warhorse was decked with a bridle
          curlymaned courser the clever folkleader



          stately proceeded stepped then an earltroop
        of lindenwood bearers her footprints were seen then
          widely in woodpaths her way oer the bottoms
          where she faraway fared oer fencountry murky
          bore away breathless the best of retainers
          who pondered with hrothgar the welfare of country
        the son of the athelings then went oer the stony
          declivitous cliffs the closecovered passes
          narrow passages paths unfrequented
          nesses abrupt nickerhaunts many
          one of a few of wisemooded heroes
        he onward advanced to view the surroundings
          till he found unawares woods of the mountain
          oer hoarstones hanging holtwood unjoyful
          the water stood under welling and gory
          twas irksome in spirit to all of the danemen
        friends of the scyldings to many a liegeman



          sad to be suffered a sorrow unlittle
          to each of the earlmen when to æscheres head they
          came on the cliff the current was seething
          with blood and with gore 
        the horn anon sang the battlesong ready
          the troop were all seated they saw long the water then



          many a serpent meredragons wondrous
          trying the waters nickers alying
          on the cliffs of the nesses which at noonday full often
        go on the seadeeps their sorrowful journey
          wildbeasts and wormkind away then they hastened



          hotmooded hateful they heard the great clamor
          the wartrumpet winding one did the geatprince
      sunder from earthjoys with arrow from bowstring
        from his seastruggle tore him that the trusty warmissile



          pierced to his vitals he proved in the currents
          less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried
          soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer
          was straitened most sorely with swordpointed boarspears
        pressed in the battle and pulled to the cliffedge
          the liegemen then looked on the loathfashioned stranger



          beowulf donned then his battleequipments
          cared little for life inlaid and most ample
          the handwoven corslet which could cover his body
        must the wavedeeps explore that war might be powerless
          to harm the great hero and the hating ones grasp might
          not peril his safety his head was protected
          by the lightflashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms
          trying the eddies treasureemblazoned
        encircled with jewels as in seasons long past
          the weaponsmith worked it wondrously made it
          with swinebodies fashioned it that thenceforward no longer
          brand might bite it and battlesword hurt it
          and that was not least of helpers in prowess



        that hrothgars spokesman had lent him when straitened
          and the hilted handsword was hrunting entitled
          old and most excellent mong all of the treasures
          its blade was of iron blotted with poison
          hardened with gore it failed not in battle
        any hero under heaven in hand who it brandished
          who ventured to take the terrible journeys
          the battlefield sought not the earliest occasion
          that deeds of daring twas destined to complish



          ecglafs kinsman minded not soothly
        exulting in strength what erst he had spoken
          drunken with wine when the weapon he lent to
          a swordhero bolder himself did not venture
          neath the strife of the currents his life to endanger
      to famedeeds perform there he forfeited glory
        repute for his strength not so with the other
          when he clad in his corslet had equipped him for battle









          beowulf spake ecgtheows son
          recall now oh famous kinsman of healfdene
          prince very prudent now to part i am ready
          goldfriend of earlmen what erst we agreed on



         should i lay down my life in lending thee assistance
          when my earthjoys were over thou wouldst evermore serve me
          in stead of a father my faithful thanemen
          my trusty retainers protect thou and care for
          fall i in battle and hrothgar belovèd



        send unto higelac the highvalued jewels
          thou to me hast allotted the lord of the geatmen
          may perceive from the gold the hrethling may see it



          when he looks on the jewels that a gemgiver found i
          good overmeasure enjoyed him while able
        and the ancient heirloom unferth permit thou
          the famed one to have the heavysword splendid
          the hardedgèd weapon with hrunting to aid me
          i shall gain me glory or grimdeath shall take me



          the atheling of geatmen uttered these words and
        heroic did hasten not any rejoinder
          was willing to wait for the wavecurrent swallowed



          the doughtyinbattle then a dayslength elapsed ere
          he was able to see the sea at its bottom
          early she found then who fifty of winters
        the course of the currents kept in her fury
          grisly and greedy that the grim ones dominion





          some one of men from above was exploring
          forth did she grab them grappled the warrior
          with horrible clutches yet no sooner she injured
        his body unscathèd the burnie outguarded
          that she proved but powerless to pierce through the armor
          the limbmail locked with loathgrabbing fingers
          the seawolf bare then when bottomward came she



          the ringprince homeward that he after was powerless
         to deal with his weapons
          but many a merebeast tormented him swimming



          floodbeasts no few with fiercebiting tusks did
          break through his burnie the brave one pursued they
          the earl then discovered he was down in some cavern
        where no water whatever anywise harmed him
          and the clutch of the current could come not anear him
          since the roofedhall prevented brightness agleaming
          firelight he saw flashing resplendent
          the good one saw then the seabottoms monster



        the mighty merewoman he made a great onset
          with weaponofbattle his hand not desisted
          from striking that warblade struck on her head then
          a battlesong greedy the stranger perceived then



          the sword would not bite her life would not injure
        but the falchion failed the folkprince when straitened
          erst had it often onsets encountered
          oft cloven the helmet the fated ones armor
          twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel
          had failed of its fame firmmooded after
        not heedless of valor but mindful of glory
          was higelacs kinsman the herochief angry
          cast then his carvedsword covered with jewels
          that it lay on the earth hard and steelpointed



          he hoped in his strength his handgrapple sturdy
        so any must act whenever he thinketh
          to gain him in battle glory unending
          and is reckless of living the lord of the wargeats
       seized by the shoulder
          the mother of grendel then mighty in struggle
        swung he his enemy since his anger was kindled
          that she fell to the floor with furious grapple



          she gave him requital early thereafter
          and stretched out to grab him the strongest of warriors
          faintmooded stumbled till he fell in his traces



        footgoing champion then she sat on the hallguest
          and wielded her warknife widebladed flashing
          for her son would take vengeance her one only bairn



          his breastarmor woven bode on his shoulder
          it guarded his life the entrance defended
        gainst swordpoint and edges ecgtheows son there
          had fatally journeyed champion of geatmen
          in the arms of the ocean had the armor not given
          closewoven corslet comfort and succor



          and had god most holy not awarded the victory
        allknowing lord easily did heavens
          ruler most righteous arrange it with justice
          uprose he erect ready for battle









          then he saw mid the wargems a weapon of victory
          an ancient giantsword of edges adoughty
          glory of warriors of weapons twas choicest
          only twas larger than any man else was
     able to bear to the battleencounter
          the good and splendid work of the giants
          he grasped then the swordhilt knight of the scyldings
          bold and battlegrim brandished his ringsword
          hopeless of living hotly he smote her
        that the fiendwomans neck firmly it grappled



          broke through her bonejoints the bill fully pierced her
          fatecursèd body she fell to the ground then
          the handsword was bloody the hero exulted
          the brand was brilliant brightly it glimmered
        just as from heaven gemlike shineth
          the torch of the firmament he glanced long the building
          and turned by the wall then higelacs vassal
          raging and wrathful raised his battlesword
          strong by the handle the edge was not useless
        to the heroinbattle but he speedily wished to
          give grendel requital for the many assaults he
          had worked on the westdanes not once but often
          when he slew in slumber the subjects of hrothgar
          swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers
        of the folk of the danemen and fully as many
          carried away a horrible prey
          he gave him requital grimraging champion



          when he saw on his restplace weary of conflict
          grendel lying of lifejoys bereavèd
        as the battle at heorot erstwhile had scathed him
          his body far bounded a blow when he suffered
          death having seized him swordsmiting heavy
          and he cut off his head then early this noticed
          the clever carles who as comrades of hrothgar



        gazed on the seadeeps that the surging wavecurrents
          were mightily mingled the mereflood was gory
          of the good one the grayhaired together held converse



          the hoary of head that they hoped not to see again
          the atheling ever that exulting in victory
        hed return there to visit the distinguished folkruler
      then many concluded the merewolf had killed him
          the ninth hour came then from the nessedge departed
          the boldmooded scyldings the goldfriend of heroes
          homeward betook him the strangers sat down then
        soulsick sorrowful the seawaves regarding
          they wished and yet weened not their wellloved friendlord



          to see any more the swordblade began then
          the blood having touched it contracting and shriveling
          with battleicicles twas a wonderful marvel
        that it melted entirely likest to ice when
          the father unbindeth the bond of the frost and
          unwindeth the wavebands he who wieldeth dominion
          of times and of tides a truthfirm creator
          nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling
        lord of the weders though they lay all around him
          than the head and the handle handsome with jewels
      the brand early melted burnt was the weapon
          so hot was the blood the strangespirit poisonous



          that in it did perish he early swam off then
        who had bided in combat the carnage of haters
          went up through the ocean the eddies were cleansèd
          the spacious expanses when the spirit from farland
          his life put aside and this shortlived existence
          the seamens defender came swimming to land then
        doughty of spirit rejoiced in his seagift
          the bulky burden which he bore in his keeping
          the excellent vassals advanced then to meet him
          to god they were grateful were glad in their chieftain
          that to see him safe and sound was granted them
        from the highminded hero then helmet and burnie
          were speedily loosened the ocean was putrid
          the water neath welkin weltered with gore
          forth did they fare then their footsteps retracing
          merry and mirthful measured the earthway
        the highway familiar men very daring
          bare then the head from the seacliff burdening
          each of the earlmen excellentvaliant



          four of them had to carry with labor
          the head of grendel to the high towering goldhall
        upstuck on the spear till fourteen mostvaliant
          and battlebrave geatmen came there going
          straight to the palace the prince of the people
          measured the meadways their moodbrave companion
          the atheling of earlmen entered the building
        deedvaliant man adorned with distinction
          doughty shieldwarrior to address king hrothgar
      then hung by the hair the head of grendel
          was borne to the building where beerthanes were drinking
          loth before earlmen and eke fore the lady
        the warriors beheld then a wonderful sight





          beowulf spake offspring of ecgtheow
          lo we blithely have brought thee bairn of healfdene
          prince of the scyldings these presents from ocean
          which thine eye looketh on for an emblem of glory
         i came off alive from this narrowly scaping
          in war neath the water the work with great pains i
          performed and the fight had been finished quite nearly
          had god not defended me i failed in the battle
          aught to accomplish aided by hrunting
        though that weapon was worthy but the wielder of earthfolk



          gave me willingly to see on the wall a
          heavy old handsword hanging in splendor
          
          that i swung as a weapon the wards of the house then
        i killed in the conflict 
          then the battlesword burned the brand that was lifted
          as the bloodcurrent sprang hottest of warsweats
          seizing the hilt from my foes i offbore it
          i avenged as i ought to their acts of malignity
        the murder of danemen i then make thee this promise



          thoult be able in heorot careless to slumber
          with thy throng of heroes and the thanes of thy people
          every and each of greater and lesser
          and thou needest not fear for them from the selfsame direction

          and also his mother it went to the keeping
          of the best of the worldkings where waters encircle
        who the scot divided in scylding dominion



          hrothgar discoursed the hilt he regarded
          the ancient heirloom where an oldtime contentions

          a help unto heroes heremod became not
        such to the scyldings successors of ecgwela
          he grew not to please them but grievous destruction
      and diresome deathwoes to danemen attracted
          he slew in anger his tablecompanions

        from worldjoys away widefamous ruler
          though highruling heaven in herostrength raised him
          in might exalted him oer men of all nations
          made him supreme yet a murderous spirit
          grew in his bosom he gave then no ringgems



        to the danes after custom endured he unjoyful

          i have sung thee these measures tis a marvel to tell it



        how allruling god from greatness of spirit
          giveth wisdom to children of men
          manor and earlship all things he ruleth
          he often permitteth the moodthought of man of
          the illustrious lineage to lean to possessions
        allows him earthly delights at his manor
          a highburg of heroes to hold in his keeping
          maketh portions of earthfolk hear him
          and a widereaching kingdom so that wisdom failing him
          he himself is unable to reckon its boundaries
        he liveth in luxury little debars him

          too sound is his slumber the slayer is near him

          then bruised in his bosom he with bittertoothed missile

          he is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates
          of the loathcursèd spirit what too long he hath holden
         him seemeth too small savage he hoardeth
          nor boastfully giveth goldplated rings

          the warriors hastened the heads of the peoples
          were ready to go again to their peoples



        the highmooded farer would faraway thenceward

        kinsman of healfdene a dozen of jewels
          bade him safely seek with the presents
          his wellbeloved people early returning





          then the nobleborn king kissed the distinguished
          dearlovèd liegeman the daneprince saluted him
        and claspèd his neck tears from him fell
          from the grayheaded man he two things expected
          agèd and reverend but rather the second
          that bold in council theyd meet thereafter
          the man was so dear that he failed to suppress the
        emotions that moved him but in moodfetters fastened

          everyway blameless till age did debar him
        the joys of his might which hath many oft injured




          then the band of very valiant retainers
          came to the current they were clad all in armor



          in linkwoven burnies the landwarder noticed
          the return of the earlmen as he erstwhile had seen them
         nowise with insult he greeted the strangers

        grappling with grendel to god i am thankful
          to be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey



          beowulf answered bairn of old ecgtheow

          from many of men the meeting so famous
        what mournful moments of me and of grendel

          soon did the famous scion of healfdene

          for every evil to the earlmens destroyer



          twas there my prince that i proudly distinguished
          thy land with my labors he left and retreated
          he lived his life a little while longer
        yet his righthand guarded his footstep in heorot
          and sadmooded thence to the seabottom fell he
          mournful in mind for the mightrush of battle



          the friend of the scyldings with gold that was plated
          with ornaments many much requited me
        when daylight had dawned and down to the banquet
          we had sat us together there was chanting and joyance
          the agestricken scylding asked many questions
      and of oldtimes related oft lightringing harpstrings
          joytelling wood were touched by the brave one
        now he uttered measures mourning and truthful
          then the largehearted landking a legend of wonder
          truthfully told us now troubled with years



          the agehoary warrior afterward began to
          mourn for the might that marked him in youthdays
        his breast within boiled when burdened with winters
          much he remembered from morning till night then
          we joyed us therein as etiquette suffered
          till the second night season came unto earthfolk
          then early thereafter the mother of grendel



        was ready for vengeance wretched she journeyed
          her son had death ravished the wrath of the geatmen
          the horrible woman avengèd her offspring
          and with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero



          there the spirit of æschere agèd adviser
        was ready to vanish nor when morn had lightened
          were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire
          folk of the danemen the deathweakened hero
          nor the belovèd liegeman to lay on the pyre



          she the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman
        neath mountainbrooks flood to hrothgar twas saddest
          of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain
          by the life of thee the landprince then me
          besought very sadly in seacurrents eddies
          to display my prowess to peril my safety
       mightdeeds accomplish much did he promise



          i found then the famous floodcurrents cruel
          horrible depthwarder a while unto us two
      hand was in common the currents were seething
          with gore that was clotted and grendels fierce mothers



       head i offhacked in the hall at the bottom
          with hugereaching swordedge hardly i wrested
          my life from her clutches not doomed was i then



          but the warden of earlmen afterward gave me
          jewels in quantity kinsman of healfdene




          so the belovèd landprince lived in decorum
          i had missed no rewards no meeds of my prowess
          but he gave me jewels regarding my wishes
          healfdene his bairn ill bring them to thee then



         atheling of earlmen offer them gladly
          and still unto thee is all my affection
          but few of my folkkin find i surviving
          but thee dear higelac bade he in then to carry
          the boarimage banner battlehigh helmet
        irongray armor the excellent weapon



          in songmeasures said this suitforthebattle
          hrothgar presented me bade me expressly
          wisemooded atheling thereafter to tell thee
          the whole of its history said king heregar owned it
        daneprince for long yet he wished not to give then
      the mail to his son though dearly he loved him
          hereward the hardy hold all in joyance
          i heard that there followed hard on the jewels
          two braces of stallions of striking resemblance
        dappled and yellow he granted him usance
          of horses and treasures so a kinsman should bear him
          no web of treachery weave for another
          nor by cunning craftiness cause the destruction



          of trusty companion most precious to higelac
        the bold one in battle was the bairn of his sister
          and each unto other mindful of favors



          i am told that to hygd he proffered the necklace
          wondergem rare that wealhtheow gave him
          the troopleaders daughter a trio of horses
        slender and saddlebright soon did the jewel
          embellish her bosom when the beerfeast was over
          so ecgtheows bairn brave did prove him



          warfamous man by deeds that were valiant
          he lived in honor belovèd companions
        slew not carousing his mood was not cruel
          but by handstrength hugest of heroes then living
          the brave one retained the bountiful gift that
          the lord had allowed him long was he wretched
          so that sons of the geatmen accounted him worthless
        and the lord of the liegemen loth was to do him
          mickle of honor when meadcups were passing
          they fully believed him idle and sluggish



          an indolent atheling to the honorblest man there
          came requital for the cuts he had suffered
        the folktroops defender bade fetch to the building
          the heirloom of hrethel embellished with gold



          so the brave one enjoined it there was jewel no richer
          in the form of a weapon mong geats of that era
          in beowulfs keeping he placed it and gave him
        seven of thousands manor and lordship
          common to both was land mong the people
      estate and inherited rights and possessions
          to the second one specially spacious dominions
          to the one who was better it afterward happened
        in days that followed befell the battlethanes



          after higelacs death and when heardred was murdered
          with weapons of warfare neath wellcovered targets
          when valiant battlemen in victorband sought him
          warscylfing heroes harassed the nephew
        of hereric in battle to beowulfs keeping
          turned there in time extensive dominions



          he fittingly ruled them a fifty of winters
           till
          a certain one gan on gloomdarkening nights a



        dragon to govern who guarded a treasure
          a highrising stonecliff on heath that was grayish
          a path neath it lay unknown unto mortals
          some one of earthmen entered the mountain
          the heathenish hoard laid hold of with ardor



                                                    
          he sought of himself who sorely did harm him
          but for need very pressing the servant of one of
          the sons of the heroes hateblows evaded
         seeking for shelter and the sindriven warrior
          took refuge within there he early looked in it
                                                    
                                                    
                 when the onset surprised him



        he a gemvessel saw there many of suchlike
          ancient ornaments in the earthcave were lying
          as in days of yore some one of men of
          illustrious lineage as a legacy monstrous
          there had secreted them careful and thoughtful
        dearvalued jewels death had offsnatched them
          in the days of the past and the one man moreover
          of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest
          was fain to defer it friendmourning warder
          a little longer to be left in enjoyment
        of longlasting treasure a barrow allready
          stood on the plain the streamcurrents nigh to
          new by the nessedge unnethe of approaching
          the keeper of rings carried within a
          ponderous deal of the treasure of nobles
        of gold that was beaten briefly he spake then



          hold thou o earth now heroes no more may
          the earnings of earlmen lo erst in thy bosom
          worthy men won them wardeath hath ravished
          perilous lifebale all my warriors
        liegemen belovèd who this life have forsaken
          who hallpleasures saw no swordbearer have i
          and no one to burnish the goldplated vessel
          the highvalued beaker my heroes are vanished
          the hardy helmet behung with gilding
        shall be reaved of its riches the ringcleansers slumber
          who were charged to have ready visorsforbattle
          and the burnie that bided in battleencounter
      oer breaking of warshields the bite of the edges
          moulds with the hero the ringtwisted armor
        its lord being lifeless no longer may journey
          hanging by heroes harpjoy is vanished
          the rapture of gleewood no excellent falcon
          swoops through the building no swiftfooted charger
          grindeth the gravel a grievous destruction
        no few of the worldfolk widely hath scattered
          so woful of spirit one after all
          lamented mournfully moaning in sadness
          by day and by night till death with its billows



          dashed on his spirit then the ancient duskscather
        found the great treasure standing all open
          he who flaming and fiery flies to the barrows
          naked wardragon nightly escapeth
          encompassed with fire men under heaven
          widely beheld him tis said that he looks for
        the hoard in the earth where old he is guarding
          the heathenish treasure hell be nowise the better



          so threehundred winters the waster of peoples
          held upon earth that excellent hoardhall
          till the forementioned earlman angered him bitterly
        the beatplated beaker he bare to his chieftain
          and fullest remission for all his remissness
          begged of his liegelord then the hoard was discovered
          the treasure was taken his petition was granted



          the lornmooded liegeman his lord regarded
        the oldwork of earthfolktwas the earliest occasion
          when the dragon awoke the strife was renewed there
          he snuffed long the stone then stouthearted found he
      the footprint of foeman too far had he gone
          with cunning craftiness close to the head of
        the firespewing dragon so undoomed he may scape from
          anguish and exile with ease who possesseth
          the favor of heaven the hoardwarden eagerly
          searched oer the ground then would meet with the person
          that caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining
        gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern
          all of it outward not any of earthmen
          was seen in that desert yet he joyed in the battle
          rejoiced in the conflict oft he turned to the barrow
          sought for the gemcup this he soon perceived then



        that some man or other had discovered the gold
          the famous folktreasure not fain did the hoardward
          wait until evening then the ward of the barrow
          was angry in spirit the loathèd one wished to
          pay for the dearvalued drinkcup with fire
        then the day was done as the dragon would have it
          he no longer would wait on the wall but departed



          fireimpelled flaming fearful the start was
          to earls in the land as it early thereafter
          to their giverofgold was grievously ended






          the stranger began then to vomit forth fire
          to burn the great manor the blaze then glimmered
          for anguish to earlmen not anything living
      was the hateful airgoer willing to leave there
         the war of the worm widely was noticed
          the feud of the foeman afar and anear
          how the enemy injured the earls of the geatmen
          harried with hatred back he hied to the treasure
          to the wellhidden cavern ere the coming of daylight
        he had circled with fire the folk of those regions
          with brand and burning in the barrow he trusted
          in the wall and his warmight the weening deceived him



          then straight was the horror to beowulf published
          early forsooth that his own native homestead
        the best of buildings was burning and melting
          giftseat of geatmen twas a grief to the spirit
          of the goodmooded hero the greatest of sorrows



          the wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom
          gainst the ancient commandments he had bitterly angered
        the lord everlasting with lorn meditations
          his bosom welled inward as was nowise his custom
          the firespewing dragon fully had wasted
          the fastness of warriors the waterland outward
          the manor with fire the folkruling hero
        prince of the weders was planning to wreak him
          the warmens defender bade them to make him
          earlmens atheling an excellent warshield



          wholly of iron fully he knew then
          that wood from the forest was helpless to aid him
        shield against fire the longworthy ruler
          must live the last of his limited earthdays
          of life in the world and the worm along with him
          though he long had been holding hoardwealth in plenty



          then the ringprince disdained to seek with a warband
        with army extensive the airgoing ranger
          he felt no fear of the foemans assaults and
          he counted for little the might of the dragon
      his power and prowess for previously dared he



          a heap of hostility hazarded dangers
        warthane when hrothgars palace he cleansèd
          conquering combatant clutched in the battle
          the kinsmen of grendel of kindred detested



          twas of handfights not least where higelac was slaughtered
          when the king of the geatmen with clashings of battle
        friendlord of folks in frisian dominions
          offspring of hrethrel perished through sworddrink
          with battleswords beaten thence beowulf came then
          on selfhelp relying swam through the waters
          he bare on his arm lonegoing thirty
        outfits of armor when the ocean he mounted
          the hetwars by no means had need to be boastful
          of their fighting afoot who forward to meet him
          carried their warshields not many returned from
          the bravemooded battleknight back to their homesteads
        ecgtheows bairn oer the bightcourses swam then
          lonegoer lorn to his landfolk returning
          where hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom



          rings and dominion her son she not trusted
          to be able to keep the kingdom devised him
        gainst alien races on the death of king higelac



          yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling
          in any way ever to act as a suzerain
          to heardred or promise to govern the kingdom
          yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him
        gracious with honor till he grew to be older



          wielded the weders widefleeing outlaws
          ohtheres sons sought him oer the waters
          they had stirred a revolt gainst the helm of the scylfings
          the best of the seakings who in swedish dominions
        distributed treasure distinguished folkleader
      twas the end of his earthdays injury fatal
          by swing of the sword he received as a greeting
          offspring of higelac ongentheows bairn
          later departed to visit his homestead
        when heardred was dead let beowulf rule them
          govern the geatmen good was that folkking




          he planned requital for the folkleaders ruin
          in days thereafter to eadgils the wretched
          becoming an enemy ohtheres son then
          went with a wartroop oer the widestretching currents
         with warriors and weapons with woejourneys cold he
          after avenged him the kings life he took



          so he came off uninjured from all of his battles
          perilous fights offspring of ecgtheow
          from his deeds of daring till that day most momentous
        when he fatedriven fared to fight with the dragon



          with eleven companions the prince of the geatmen
          went lowering with fury to look at the firedrake
          inquiring hed found how the feud had arisen
          hate to his heroes the highlyfamed gemvessel
        was brought to his keeping through the hand of th informer



          that in the throng was thirteenth of heroes
          that caused the beginning of conflict so bitter
          captive and wretched must sadmooded thenceward



          point out the place he passed then unwillingly
        to the spot where he knew of the notable cavern
          the cave under earth not far from the ocean
          the anger of eddies which inward was full of
          jewels and wires a warden uncanny
      warrior weaponed wardered the treasure
        old under earth no easy possession
          for any of earthfolk access to get to
          then the battlebrave atheling sat on the nazeedge
          while the goldfriend of geatmen gracious saluted
          his firesidecompanions woe was his spirit
        deathboding wavring weird very near him
          who must seize the old hero his soultreasure look for
          dragging aloof his life from his body
          not fleshhidden long was the folkleaders spirit
          beowulf spake ecgtheows son



        i survived in my youthdays many a conflict
          hours of onset that all i remember
          i was sevenwinters old when the jewelprince took me
          highlord of heroes at the hands of my father
          hrethel the heroking had me in keeping



        gave me treasure and feasting our kinship remembered
          not ever was i _any_ less dear to him



          knight in the boroughs than the bairns of his household
          herebald and hæthcyn and higelac mine
          to the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman
        was murderbed strewn since him hæthcyn from hornbow



          his sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow
          erred in his aim and injured his kinsman
          one brother the other with bloodsprinkled spear



          twas a feeless fight finished in malice
        sad to his spirit the folkprince however
          had to part from existence with vengeance untaken



          so to hoarheaded hero tis heavily crushing
      to live to see his son as he rideth
          young on the gallows then measures he chanteth
        a song of sorrow when his son is hanging
          for the ravens delight and aged and hoary
          he is unable to offer any assistance
          every morning his offsprings departure
          is constant recalled he cares not to wait for
        the birth of an heir in his boroughenclosures
          since that one through deathpain the deeds hath experienced
          he heartgrieved beholds in the house of his son the
          winebuilding wasted the windlodging places
          reaved of their roaring the riders are sleeping
        the knights in the grave theres no sound of the harpwood
          joy in the yards as of yore were familiar



          he seeks then his chamber singeth a woesong
          one for the other all too extensive
          seemed homesteads and plains so the helm of the weders



          mindful of herebald heartsorrow carried
         stirred with emotion nowise was able
          to wreak his ruin on the ruthless destroyer
          he was unable to follow the warrior with hatred
          with deeds that were direful though dear he not held him
      then pressed by the pang this pain occasioned him
        he gave up glee godlight elected
          he left to his sons as the man that is rich does
          his land and fortress when from life he departed



          then was crime and hostility twixt swedes and geatmen
          oer widestretching water warring was mutual
        burdensome hatred when hrethel had perished
          and ongentheows offspring were active and valiant
          wished not to hold to peace oversea but
          round hreosnabeorh often accomplished
          cruelest massacre this my kinsman avengèd
        the feud and fury as tis found on inquiry
          though one of them paid it with forfeit of lifejoys



          with price that was hard the struggle became then
          fatal to hæthcyn lord of the geatmen
          then i heard that at morning one brother the other
        with edges of irons egged on to murder
          where ongentheow maketh onset on eofor
          the helmet crashed the hoaryhaired scylfing
          swordsmitten fell his hand then remembered
          feudhate sufficient refused not the deathblow



        the gems that he gave me with jewelbright sword i
          quited in contest as occasion was offered
          land he allowed me lifejoy at homestead
          manor to live on little he needed
          from gepids or danes or in sweden to look for
        trooper less true with treasure to buy him
          mong footsoldiers ever in front i would hie me
          alone in the vanguard and evermore gladly
          warfare shall wage while this weapon endureth
          that late and early often did serve me



        when i proved before heroes the slayer of dæghrefn
          knight of the hugmen he by no means was suffered
          to the king of the frisians to carry the jewels
          the breastdecoration but the bannerpossessor
          bowed in the battle bravemooded atheling
    no weapon was slayer but wargrapple broke then
          the surge of his spirit his body destroying
          now shall weapons edge make war for the treasure
          and hand and firmsword beowulf spake then
          boastwords utteredthe latest occasion



        i braved in my youthdays battles unnumbered
          still am i willing the struggle to look for
          famedeeds perform folkwarden prudent
          if the hateful despoiler forth from his cavern
          seeketh me out each of the heroes
        helmbearers sturdy he thereupon greeted



          belovèd coliegemenhis last salutation
          no brand would i bear no blade for the dragon
          wist i a way my wordboast to complish
          else with the monster as with grendel i did it
        but fire in the battle hot i expect there
          furious flameburning so i fixed on my body
          target and warmail the ward of the barrow
          ill not flee from a footlength the foeman uncanny
          at the wall twill befall us as fate decreeth



        each ones creator i am eager in spirit
          with the wingèd warhero to away with all boasting
          bide on the barrow with burnies protected



          earls in armor which of _us_ two may better
          bear his disaster when the battle is over
        tis no matter of yours and man cannot do it
          but me and me only to measure his strength with
          the monster of malice mightdeeds to complish
          i with prowess shall gain the gold or the battle
      direful deathwoe will drag off your ruler
        the mighty champion rose by his shield then
          brave under helmet in battlemail went he
          neath steeprising stonecliffs the strength he relied on
          of one man alone no work for a coward
          then he saw by the wall who a great many battles
        had lived through most worthy when foottroops collided



          stonearches standing stouthearted champion
          saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward
          the flood of the fountain was fuming with warflame
          not nigh to the hoard for season the briefest
        could he brave without burning the abyss that was yawning
          the drake was so fiery the prince of the weders
          caused then that words came from his bosom
          so fierce was his fury the firmhearted shouted
          his battleclear voice came in resounding
        neath the graycolored stone stirred was his hatred



          the hoardward distinguished the speech of a man
          time was no longer to look out for friendship
          the breath of the monster issued forth first
          vapory warsweat out of the stonecave



        the earth reechoed the earl neath the barrow
          lifted his shield lord of the geatmen
          towrd the terrible stranger the ringtwisted creatures
          heart was then ready to seek for a struggle



          the excellent battleking first brandished his weapon
       the ancient heirloom of edges unblunted
          to the deathplanners twain was terror from other



          the lord of the troopers intrepidly stood then
          gainst his highrising shield when the dragon coiled him



          quickly together in corslet he bided
   he went then in blazes bended and striding
          hasting him forward his life and body
          the targe well protected for timeperiod shorter
          than wish demanded for the wellrenowned leader
          where he then for the first day was forced to be victor
       famous in battle as fate had not willed it
          the lord of the geatmen uplifted his hand then
          smiting the firedrake with sword that was precious
          that bright on the bone the bladeedge did weaken
          bit more feebly than his folkleader needed
       burdened with balegriefs then the barrowprotector



          when the swordblow had fallen was fierce in his spirit
          flinging his fires flamings of battle
          gleamed then afar the goldfriend of weders



          boasted no conquests his battlesword failed him
       naked in conflict as by no means it ought to
          longtrusty weapon twas no slight undertaking
          that ecgtheows famous offspring would leave
          the drakecaverns bottom he must live in some region
          other than this by the will of the dragon
       as each one of earthmen existence must forfeit
          twas early thereafter the excellent warriors



          met with each other anew and afresh
          the hoardward took heart 



          sorrow he suffered encircled with fire
       who the people erst governed his companions by no means
          were banded about him bairns of the princes



          with valorous spirit but they sped to the forest
          seeking for safety the souldeeps of one were



          ruffled by care kinlove can never
       aught in him waver who well doth consider








          the son of weohstan was wiglaf entitled
          shieldwarrior precious prince of the scylfings
          ælfheres kinsman he saw his dear liegelord
          enduring the heat neath helmet and visor
         then he minded the holding that erst he had given him



          the wægmunding warriors wealthblessèd homestead
          each of the folkrights his father had wielded
          he was hot for the battle his hand seized the target
          the yellowbark shield he unsheathed his old weapon
        which was known among earthmen as the relic of eanmund
          ohtheres offspring whom exiled and friendless
          weohstan did slay with swordedge in battle
          and carried his kinsman the clearshining helmet
          the ringmade burnie the old giantweapon
        that onela gave him his boonfellows armor
          ready wartrappings he the feud did not mention
          though hed fatally smitten the son of his brother
          many a halfyear held he the treasures
          the bill and the burnie till his bairn became able
        like his father before him famedeeds to complish
          then he gave him mong geatmen a goodly array of
          weeds for his warfare he went from life then
          old on his journey twas the earliest time then



          that the youthful champion might charge in the battle
        aiding his liegelord his spirit was dauntless
          nor did kinsmans bequest quail at the battle
          this the dragon discovered on their coming together
          wiglaf uttered many a rightsaying
          said to his fellows sad was his spirit



        i remember the time when tasting the meadcup
          we promised in the hall the lord of us all
      who gave us these ringtreasures that this battleequipment
          swords and helmets wed certainly quite him
          should need of such aid ever befall him



        in the warband he chose us for this journey spontaneously
          stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels
          since he held and esteemed us trustworthy spearmen
          hardy helmbearers though this heroachievement
          our lord intended alone to accomplish
        ward of his people for most of achievements
          doings audacious he did among earthfolk



          the day is now come when the ruler of earthmen
          needeth the vigor of valiant heroes
          let us wend us towards him the warprince to succor
        while the heat yet rageth horrible firefight



          god wot in me tis mickle the liefer
          the blaze should embrace my body and eat it
          with my treasurebestower meseemeth not proper
          to bear our battleshields back to our country
        less first we are able to fell and destroy the
          longhating foeman to defend the life of



          the prince of the weders well do i know tisnt
          earned by his exploits he only of geatmen
          sorrow should suffer sink in the battle
        brand and helmet to us both shall be common
          shieldcover burnie through the balesmoke he stalked then
          went under helmet to the help of his chieftain



          briefly discoursing beowulf dear
          perform thou all fully as thou formerly saidst
        in thy youthful years that while yet thou livedst
      thou wouldst let thine honor not ever be lessened
          thy life thou shalt save mighty in actions
          atheling undaunted with all of thy vigor



          ill give thee assistance the dragon came raging
        wildmooded stranger when these words had been uttered
           seeking his enemies
          men that were hated with hotgleaming firewaves
          with blazebillows burned the board to its edges
          the fightarmor failed then to furnish assistance
        to the youthful spearhero but the youngagèd stripling
          quickly advanced neath his kinsmans wartarget
          since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire



          then the warriorking was careful of glory
          he soundly smote with swordforthebattle
        that it stood in the head by hatred driven
          nægling was shivered the old and ironmade



          brand of beowulf in battle deceived him
          twas denied him that edges of irons were able
          to help in the battle the hand was too mighty
        which every weapon as i heard on inquiry
          outstruck in its stroke when to struggle he carried
          the wonderful warsword it waxed him no better



          then the peopledespoilerthird of his onsets
          fierceraging firedrake of feudhate was mindful
        charged on the strong one when chance was afforded
          heated and wargrim seized on his neck
          with teeth that were bitter he bloody did wax with
          soulgore seething swordblood in waves boiled




          then i heard that at need of the king of the people
          the upstanding earlman exhibited prowess
          vigor and courage as suited his nature
          he his head did not guard but the highminded liegemans
         hand was consumed when he succored his kinsman
          so he struck the strifebringing strangecomer lower
          earlthane in armor that _in_ went the weapon
          gleaming and plated that gan then the fire



          later to lessen the liegelord himself then
        retained his consciousness brandished his warknife
          battlesharp bitter that he bare on his armor



          the wederlord cut the worm in the middle
          they had felled the enemy  the pair had destroyed him
        landchiefs related so a liegeman should prove him
          a thaneman when needed to the prince twas the last of
          his era of conquest by his own great achievements





          the latest of worlddeeds the wound then began
          which the earthdwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him
        to burn and to swell he soon then discovered
          that bitterest balewoe in his bosom was raging
          poison within the atheling advanced then



          that along by the wall he prudent of spirit
          might sit on a settle he saw the giantwork
        how arches of stone strengthened with pillars
          the earthhall eternal inward supported
          then the longworthy liegeman laved with his hand the



          farfamous chieftain gory from swordedge
          refreshing the face of his friendlord and ruler
        sated with battle unbinding his helmet
          beowulf answered of his injury spake he
          his wound that was fatal 



          my son i would give now my battleequipments
          had any of heirs been after me granted
          along of my body this people i governed
          fifty of winters no king mong my neighbors
        dared to encounter me with comradesinbattle
          try me with terror the time to me ordered
          i bided at home mine own kept fitly
          sought me no snares swore me not many



          oaths in injustice joy over all this
        im able to have though ill with my deathwounds
          hence the ruler of earthmen need not charge me
          with the killing of kinsmen when cometh my life out
          forth from my body fare thou with haste now



          to behold the hoard neath the hoargrayish stone
        welllovèd wiglaf now the worm is alying
          sorewounded sleepeth disseized of his treasure
          go thou in haste that treasures of old i
          goldwealth may gaze on together see lying
      the etherbright jewels be easier able
        having the heap of hoardgems to yield my
          life and the landfolk whom long i have governed





          then heard i that wihstans son very quickly
          these words being uttered heeded his liegelord
          wounded and warsick went in his armor
          his wellwoven ringmail neath the roof of the barrow
         then the trusty retainer treasuregems many



          victorious saw when the seat he came near to
          goldtreasure sparkling spread on the bottom
          wonder on the wall and the wormcreatures cavern
          the ancient dawnfliers vessels astanding
        cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavèd
          robbed of their ornaments there were helmets in numbers
          old and rusteaten armbracelets many
          artfully woven wealth can easily
          gold on the seabottom turn into vanity
        each one of earthmen arm him who pleaseth
          and he saw there lying an allgolden banner
          high oer the hoard of handwonders greatest
          linkèd with lacets a light from it sparkled
          that the floor of the cavern he was able to look on



        to examine the jewels sight of the dragon
      not any was offered but edge offcarried him



          then i heard that the hero the hoardtreasure plundered
          the giantwork ancient reaved in the cavern
          bare on his bosom the beakers and platters
        as himself would fain have it and took off the standard
          the brightest of beacons the bill had erst injured
           the oldrulers weapon
          him who long had watched as ward of the jewels
          who fireterror carried hot for the treasure
        rolling in battle in middlemost darkness
          till murdered he perished the messenger hastened
          not loth to return hurried by jewels
          curiosity urged him if excellentmooded
          alive he should find the lord of the weders
        mortally wounded at the place where he left him
          mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain
          his liegelord belovèd at his lifesend gory
          he thereupon gan to lave him with water
          till the point of his word piercèd his breasthoard
        beowulf spake 



          the old one in sorrow for the jewels i look on
          thanks do i utter for all to the ruler
          wielder of worship with words of devotion
          the lord everlasting that he let me such treasures
        gain for my people ere death overtook me
          since ive bartered the agèd life to me granted
          for treasure of jewels attend ye henceforward



          the wants of the warthanes i can wait here no longer
          the battlefamed bid ye to build them a gravehill
        bright when im burned at the brimcurrents limit
          as a memorymark to the men i have governed
      aloft it shall tower on whalesness uprising
          that earls of the ocean hereafter may call it
          beowulfs barrow those who barks everdashing
        from a distance shall drive oer the darkness of waters



          the boldmooded trooplord took from his neck then
          the ring that was golden gave to his liegeman
          the youthful warhero his goldflashing helmet
          his collar and warmail bade him well to enjoy them



        thou art latest left of the line of our kindred
          of wægmunding people weird hath offcarried
          all of my kinsmen to the creators glory
          earls in their vigor i shall after them fare
          twas the aged liegelords lastspoken word in
        his musings of spirit ere he mounted the fire
          the battlewaves burning from his bosom departed
          his soul to seek the sainted ones glory





          it had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer
          to behold on earth the most ardentbelovèd
          at his lifedays limit lying there helpless
          the slayer too lay there of life all bereavèd
         horrible earthdrake harassed with sorrow



          the roundtwisted monster was permitted no longer
          to govern the ringhoards but edges of warswords
          mightily seized him battlesharp sturdy
          leavings of hammers that still from his wounds
        the flierfromfarland fell to the earth
          hard by his hoardhouse hopped he at midnight
          not eer through the air nor exulting in jewels
          suffered them to see him but he sank then to earthward
          through the herochiefs handwork i heard sure it throve then





        but few in the land of liegemen of valor
          though of every achievement bold he had proved him
          to run gainst the breath of the venomous scather
          or the hall of the treasure to trouble with handblows
          if he watching had found the ward of the hoardhall
        on the barrow abiding beowulfs part of
          the treasure of jewels was paid for with death
          each of the twain had attained to the end of
          life so unlasting not long was the time till



          the tardyatbattle returned from the thicket
        the timid trucebreakers ten all together
          who durst not before play with the lances
          in the prince of the peoples pressing emergency



          but blushing with shame with shields they betook them
          with arms and armor where the old one was lying
        they gazed upon wiglaf he was sitting exhausted
          footgoing fighter not far from the shoulders
          of the lord of the people would rouse him with water
          no whit did it help him though he hoped for it keenly
          he was able on earth not at all in the leader
        life to retain and nowise to alter
          the will of the wielder the worldrulers power
          would govern the actions of each one of heroes



          as yet he is doing from the young one forthwith then
          could grimworded greeting be got for him quickly
        whose courage had failed him wiglaf discoursed then
          weohstan his son sadmooded hero



          looked on the hated he who soothness will utter
          can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels
          the ornamentarmor wherein ye are standing
        when on alebench often he offered to hallmen
          helmet and burnie the prince to his liegemen
          as best upon earth he was able to find him





          that he wildly wasted his wargear undoubtedly
          when battle oertook him the troopking no need had
        to glory in comrades yet god permitted him



          victorywielder with weapon unaided
          himself to avenge when vigor was needed
          i lifeprotection but little was able
          to give him in battle and i gan notwithstanding



        helping my kinsman 
          he waxed the weaker when with weapon i smote on
          my mortal opponent the fire less strongly
          flamed from his bosom too few of protectors
          came round the king at the critical moment



        now must ornamenttaking and weaponbestowing
          homejoyance all cease for your kindred
          food for the people each of your warriors
          must needs be bereavèd of rights that he holdeth
          in landed possessions when faraway nobles
        shall learn of your leaving your lord so basely



          the dastardly deed death is more pleasant
          to every earlman than infamous life is





          then he charged that the battle be announced at the hedge
          up oer the cliffedge where the earltroopers bided
          the whole of the morning moodwretched sat them
          bearers of battleshields both things expecting
         the end of his lifetime and the coming again of
          the liegelord belovèd little reserved he
          of news that was known who the nesscliff did travel
          but he truly discoursed to all that could hear him





          now the freegiving friendlord of the folk of the weders
        the folkprince of geatmen is fast in his deathbed
          by the deeds of the dragon in deathbed abideth
          along with him lieth his lifetaking foeman
          slain with knifewounds he was wholly unable
          to injure at all the illplanning monster



        with bite of his swordedge wiglaf is sitting
          offspring of wihstan up over beowulf
          earl oer another whose endday hath reached him
          headwatch holdeth oer heroes unliving



          for friend and for foeman the folk now expecteth
        a season of strife when the death of the folkking
          to frankmen and frisians in farlands is published
          the warhatred waxed warm gainst the hugmen



          when higelac came with an army of vessels
          faring to friesland where the frankmen in battle
        humbled him and bravely with overmight complished
          that the mailclad warrior must sink in the battle
          fell mid his folktroop no fretgems presented
          the atheling to earlmen aye was denied us

          but widely twas known that near ravenswood ongentheow



          sundered hæthcyn the hrethling from lifejoys
          when for pride overweening the warscylfings first did
          seek the geatmen with savage intentions
        early did ohtheres ageladen father
          old and terrible give blow in requital
          killing the seaking the queenmother rescued
          the old one his consort deprived of her gold
          onelas mother and ohtheres also
    and then followed the feudnursing foemen till hardly

          then with vastnumbered forces he assaulted the remnant
          weary with wounds woe often promised
          the livelong night to the sadhearted wartroop
        said he at morning would kill them with edges of weapons
          some on the gallows for glee to the fowls

          at dawn of the day after higelacs bugle
          and trumpetsound heard they when the good one proceeded
        and faring followed the flower of the troopers

  




          the bloodstainèd trace of swedes and geatmen
          the deathrush of warmen widely was noticed
          how the folks with each other feud did awaken
          the worthy one went then with wellbeloved comrades
         old and dejected to go to the fastness
          ongentheo earl upward then turned him
          of higelacs battle hed heard on inquiry
          the exultant ones prowess despaired of resistance
          with earls of the ocean to be able to struggle
        gainst seagoing sailors to save the hoardtreasure
          his wife and his children he fled after thenceward
          old neath the earthwall then was offered pursuance
          to the braves of the swedemen the banner to higelac
     they fared then forth oer the fieldofprotection
        when the hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them
          then with edges of irons was ongentheow driven
          the grayhaired to tarry that the troopruler had to
          suffer the power solely of eofor



          wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him
        wonred his son that for swinge of the edges
          the blood from his body burst out in currents
          forth neath his hair he feared not however
          grayheaded scylfing but speedily quited



          the wasting woundstroke with worse exchange
        when the king of the thanetroop thither did turn him
          the wisemooded son of wonred was powerless
          to give a returnblow to the agehoary man
          but his headshielding helmet first hewed he to pieces
          that flecked with gore perforce he did totter
        fell to the earth not fey was he yet then
          but up did he spring though an edgewound had reached him



          then higelacs vassal valiant and dauntless
          when his brother lay dead made his broadbladed weapon
          giantsword ancient defence of the giants
        bound oer the shieldwall the folkprince succumbed then



          shepherd of people was pierced to the vitals
          there were many attendants who bound up his kinsman
          carried him quickly when occasion was granted
          that the place of the slain they were suffered to manage
        this pending one hero plundered the other
          his armor of iron from ongentheow ravished
          his hardsword hilted and helmet together



          the old ones equipments he carried to higelac
          he the jewels received and rewards mid the troopers
        graciously promised and so did accomplish
          the king of the weders requited the warrush
          hrethels descendant when home he repaired him



          to eofor and wulf with widelavished treasures
          to each of them granted a hundred of thousands
   in land and rings wrought out of wire



          none upon midearth needed to twit him
          with the gifts he gave them when glory they conquered



          and to eofor then gave he his one only daughter
          the honor of home as an earnest of favor
        thats the feud and hatredas ween i twill happen
          the anger of earthmen that earls of the swedemen
          will visit on us when they hear that our leader
          lifeless is lying he who longtime protected
          his hoard and kingdom gainst hating assailers
        who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore
          the deedmighty scyldings did for the troopers
          what best did avail them and further moreover



          herodeeds complished now is haste most fitting
          that the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder
        and _that_ one carry on journey to deathpyre
          who ringpresents gave us not aught of it all
          shall melt with the brave onetheres a mass of bright jewels
          gold beyond measure grewsomely purchased
          and ending it all ornamentrings too
        bought with his life these fire shall devour
          flame shall cover no earlman shall wear
          a jewelmemento nor beautiful virgin
          have on her neck rings to adorn her
          but wretched in spirit bereavèd of goldgems
        she shall oft with others be exiled and banished
          since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken
     mirth and merriment hence many a warspear
          cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers
          heaved in the hand no harpmusics sound shall
        waken the warriors but the wancoated raven
          fain over fey ones freely shall gabble
          shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating
          when the wolf his companion he plundered the slain
          so the highminded hero was rehearsing these stories
        loathsome to hear he lied as to few of



          weirds and of words all the wartroop arose then
          neath the eagles cape sadly betook them
          weeping and woful the wonder to look at
          they saw on the sand then soulless alying
        his slaughterbed holding him who rings had given them
          in days that were done then the deathbringing moment
          was come to the good one that the king very warlike
          wielder of weders with wonderdeath perished
          first they beheld there a creature more wondrous



        the worm on the field in front of them lying
          the foeman before them the firespewing dragon
          ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors
          was scorched in the fire as he lay there he measured
          fifty of feet came forth in the nighttime
       to rejoice in the air thereafter departing
          to visit his den he in death was then fastened
          he would joy in no other earthhollowed caverns
          there stood round about him beakers and vessels
          dishes were lying and dearvalued weapons
       with ironrust eaten as in earths mighty bosom
          a thousand of winters there they had rested



          that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded
          gold of the ancients that earlman not any
          the ringhall could touch save rulinggod only
  soothking of victries gave whom he wished to



           to open the treasure
          een to such among mortals as seemed to him proper




          then twas seen that the journey prospered him little
          who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden
          down neath the wall the warden erst slaughtered
          some few of the folktroop the feud then thereafter
         was hotly avengèd tis a wonder where
          when the strengthfamous trooper has attained to the end of
          lifedays allotted then no longer the man may
          remain with his kinsmen where meadcups are flowing
          so to beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow
        assaults he sought for himself had no knowledge
          how his leaving this life was likely to happen
          so to doomsday famous folkleaders down did
          call it with curseswho complished it there
     that that man should be ever of illdeeds convicted
        confined in foulplaces fastened in hellbonds
          punished with plagues who this place should eer ravage
          he cared not for gold rather the wielders
          favor preferred he first to get sight of



          wiglaf discoursed then wihstan his son
        oft many an earlman on one mans account must
          sorrow endure as to us it hath happened
          the liegelord belovèd we could little prevail on
          kingdoms keeper counsel to follow
          not to go to the guardian of the goldhoard but let him
        lie where he long was live in his dwelling
          till the end of the world met we a destiny
          hard to endure the hoard has been looked at
          been gained very grimly too grievous the fate that
          the prince of the people pricked to come thither
        _i_ was therein and all of it looked at
          the buildings equipments since access was given me
          not kindly at all entrance permitted



          within under earthwall hastily seized i
          and held in my hands a hugeweighing burden
        of hoardtreasures costly hither out bare them
          to my liegelord belovèd life was yet in him
          and consciousness also the old one discoursed then
          much and mournfully commanded to greet you



          bade that remembering the deeds of your friendlord
        ye build on the firehill of corpses a lofty
          burialbarrow broad and farfamous
          as mid worlddwelling warriors he was widely most honored
          while he reveled in riches let us rouse us and hasten
     again to see and seek for the treasure
        the wonder neath wall the way i will show you
          that close ye may look at ringgems sufficient
          and gold in abundance let the bier with promptness
          fully be fashioned when forth we shall come
          and lift we our lord then where long he shall tarry
        wellbeloved warrior neath the wielders protection



          then the son of wihstan bade orders be given
          moodvaliant man to many of heroes
          holders of homesteads that they hither from far
          leaders of liegemen should look for the good one
        with wood for his pyre the flame shall now swallow
           the warriors leader
          who the rain of the iron often abided
          when sturdily hurled the storm of the arrows
          leapt oer lindenwall the lance rendered service
        furnished with feathers followed the arrow
          now the wisemooded son of wihstan did summon
          the best of the braves from the band of the ruler



          seven together neath the enemys roof he
          went with the seven one of the heroes
        who fared at the front a fireblazing torchlight
          bare in his hand no lot then decided
          who that hoard should havoc when heroearls saw it
          lying in the cavern uncaredfor entirely
          rusting to ruin they rued then but little
        that they hastily hence hauled out the treasure



          the dearvalued jewels the dragon eke pushed they
          the worm oer the wall let the wavecurrents take him
     the waters enwind the ward of the treasures



          there wounden gold on a wain was uploaded
        a mass unmeasured the menleader off then
          the hero hoary to whalesness was carried





          the folk of the geatmen got him then ready
          a pile on the earth strong for the burning
          behung with helmets heroknights targets
          and brightshining burnies as he begged they should have them
         then wailing warheroes their worldfamous chieftain
          their liegelord beloved laid in the middle



          soldiers began then to make on the barrow
          the largest of deadfires dark oer the vapor
          the smokecloud ascended the sadroaring fire
        mingled with weeping 
          till the building of bone it had broken to pieces
          hot in the heart heavy in spirit
          they moodsad lamented the menleaders ruin
          and mournful measures the muchgrieving widow
                                                  
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
                                                  



          the men of the weders made accordingly
          a hill on the height high and extensive
          of seagoing sailors to be seen from a distance
          and the brave ones beacon built where the fire was
        in tendays space with a wall surrounded it
          as wisest of worldfolk could most worthily plan it
          they placed in the barrow rings and jewels





          all such ornaments as erst in the treasure
          warmooded men had won in possession
        the earnings of earlmen to earth they entrusted
          the gold to the dust where yet it remaineth
          as useless to mortals as in foregoing eras
          round the deadmound rode then the doughtyinbattle
          bairns of all twelve of the chiefs of the people



        more would they mourn lament for their ruler
          speak in measure mention him with pleasure
          weighed his worth and his warlike achievements
          mightily commended as tis meet one praise his
          liegelord in words and love him in spirit
        when forth from his body he fares to destruction
          so lamented mourning the men of the geats
          fondloving vassals the fall of their lord



          said he was kindest of kings under heaven
          gentlest of men most winning of manner
        friendliest to folktroops and fondest of honor




of mans first disobedience and the fruit
of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
brought death into the world and all our woe
with loss of eden till one greater man
restore us and regain the blissful seat
sing heavenly muse that on the secret top
of oreb or of sinai didst inspire
that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
in the beginning how the heavens and earth
rose out of chaos or if sion hill
delight thee more and siloas brook that flowed
fast by the oracle of god i thence
invoke thy aid to my adventurous song
that with no middle flight intends to soar
above th aonian mount while it pursues
things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer
before all temples th upright heart and pure
instruct me for thou knowst thou from the first
wast present and with mighty wings outspread
dovelike satst brooding on the vast abyss
and madst it pregnant what in me is dark
illumine what is low raise and support
that to the height of this great argument
i may assert eternal providence
and justify the ways of god to men
    say firstfor heaven hides nothing from thy view
nor the deep tract of hellsay first what cause
moved our grand parents in that happy state
favoured of heaven so highly to fall off
from their creator and transgress his will
for one restraint lords of the world besides
who first seduced them to that foul revolt
    th infernal serpent he it was whose guile
stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
the mother of mankind what time his pride
had cast him out from heaven with all his host
of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring
to set himself in glory above his peers
he trusted to have equalled the most high
if he opposed and with ambitious aim
against the throne and monarchy of god
raised impious war in heaven and battle proud
with vain attempt him the almighty power
hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky
with hideous ruin and combustion down
to bottomless perdition there to dwell
in adamantine chains and penal fire
who durst defy th omnipotent to arms
    nine times the space that measures day and night
to mortal men he with his horrid crew
lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf
confounded though immortal but his doom
reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
both of lost happiness and lasting pain
torments him round he throws his baleful eyes
that witnessed huge affliction and dismay
mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
at once as far as angels ken he views
the dismal situation waste and wild
a dungeon horrible on all sides round
as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
no light but rather darkness visible
served only to discover sights of woe
regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
and rest can never dwell hope never comes
that comes to all but torture without end
still urges and a fiery deluge fed
with everburning sulphur unconsumed
such place eternal justice has prepared
for those rebellious here their prison ordained
in utter darkness and their portion set
as far removed from god and light of heaven
as from the centre thrice to th utmost pole
oh how unlike the place from whence they fell
there the companions of his fall oerwhelmed
with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire
he soon discerns and weltering by his side
one next himself in power and next in crime
long after known in palestine and named
beelzebub to whom th archenemy
and thence in heaven called satan with bold words
breaking the horrid silence thus began
    if thou beest hebut o how fallen how changed
from him who in the happy realms of light
clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
myriads though brightif he whom mutual league
united thoughts and counsels equal hope
and hazard in the glorious enterprise
joined with me once now misery hath joined
in equal ruin into what pit thou seest
from what height fallen so much the stronger proved
he with his thunder and till then who knew
the force of those dire arms yet not for those
nor what the potent victor in his rage
can else inflict do i repent or change
though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind
and high disdain from sense of injured merit
that with the mightiest raised me to contend
and to the fierce contentions brought along
innumerable force of spirits armed
that durst dislike his reign and me preferring
his utmost power with adverse power opposed
in dubious battle on the plains of heaven
and shook his throne what though the field be lost
all is not lostthe unconquerable will
and study of revenge immortal hate
and courage never to submit or yield
and what is else not to be overcome
that glory never shall his wrath or might
extort from me to bow and sue for grace
with suppliant knee and deify his power
who from the terror of this arm so late
doubted his empirethat were low indeed
that were an ignominy and shame beneath
this downfall since by fate the strength of gods
and this empyreal substance cannot fail
since through experience of this great event
in arms not worse in foresight much advanced
we may with more successful hope resolve
to wage by force or guile eternal war
irreconcilable to our grand foe
who now triumphs and in th excess of joy
sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven
    so spake th apostate angel though in pain
vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair
and him thus answered soon his bold compeer
    o prince o chief of many throned powers
that led th embattled seraphim to war
under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
fearless endangered heavens perpetual king
and put to proof his high supremacy
whether upheld by strength or chance or fate
too well i see and rue the dire event
that with sad overthrow and foul defeat
hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host
in horrible destruction laid thus low
as far as gods and heavenly essences
can perish for the mind and spirit remains
invincible and vigour soon returns
though all our glory extinct and happy state
here swallowed up in endless misery
but what if he our conqueror 
have left us this our spirit and strength entire
strongly to suffer and support our pains
that we may so suffice his vengeful ire
or do him mightier service as his thralls
by right of war whateer his business be
here in the heart of hell to work in fire
or do his errands in the gloomy deep
what can it the avail though yet we feel
strength undiminished or eternal being
to undergo eternal punishment
    whereto with speedy words th archfiend replied
fallen cherub to be weak is miserable
doing or suffering but of this be sure
to do aught good never will be our task
but ever to do ill our sole delight
as being the contrary to his high will
whom we resist if then his providence
out of our evil seek to bring forth good
our labour must be to pervert that end
and out of good still to find means of evil
which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb
his inmost counsels from their destined aim
but see the angry victor hath recalled
his ministers of vengeance and pursuit
back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail
shot after us in storm oerblown hath laid
the fiery surge that from the precipice
of heaven received us falling and the thunder
winged with red lightning and impetuous rage
perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
to bellow through the vast and boundless deep
let us not slip th occasion whether scorn
or satiate fury yield it from our foe
seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild
the seat of desolation void of light
save what the glimmering of these livid flames
casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend
from off the tossing of these fiery waves
there rest if any rest can harbour there
and reassembling our afflicted powers
consult how we may henceforth most offend
our enemy our own loss how repair
how overcome this dire calamity
what reinforcement we may gain from hope
if not what resolution from despair
    thus satan talking to his nearest mate
with head uplift above the wave and eyes
that sparkling blazed his other parts besides
prone on the flood extended long and large
lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
as whom the fables name of monstrous size
titanian or earthborn that warred on jove
briareos or typhon whom the den
by ancient tarsus held or that seabeast
leviathan which god of all his works
created hugest that swim th oceanstream
him haply slumbering on the norway foam
the pilot of some small nightfoundered skiff
deeming some island oft as seamen tell
with fixed anchor in his scaly rind
moors by his side under the lee while night
invests the sea and wished morn delays
so stretched out huge in length the archfiend lay
chained on the burning lake nor ever thence
had risen or heaved his head but that the will
and high permission of allruling heaven
left him at large to his own dark designs
that with reiterated crimes he might
heap on himself damnation while he sought
evil to others and enraged might see
how all his malice served but to bring forth
infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn
on man by him seduced but on himself
treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured
    forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
his mighty stature on each hand the flames
driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled
in billows leave i th midst a horrid vale
then with expanded wings he steers his flight
aloft incumbent on the dusky air
that felt unusual weight till on dry land
he lightsif it were land that ever burned
with solid as the lake with liquid fire
and such appeared in hue as when the force
of subterranean wind transports a hill
torn from pelorus or the shattered side
of thundering etna whose combustible
and fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire
sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds
and leave a singed bottom all involved
with stench and smoke such resting found the sole
of unblest feet him followed his next mate
both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood
as gods and by their own recovered strength
not by the sufferance of supernal power
    is this the region this the soil the clime
said then the lost archangel this the seat
that we must change for heaventhis mournful gloom
for that celestial light be it so since he
who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
what shall be right farthest from him is best
whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
above his equals farewell happy fields
where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail
infernal world and thou profoundest hell
receive thy new possessorone who brings
a mind not to be changed by place or time
the mind is its own place and in itself
can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven
what matter where if i be still the same
and what i should be all but less than he
whom thunder hath made greater here at least
we shall be free th almighty hath not built
here for his envy will not drive us hence
here we may reign secure and in my choice
to reign is worth ambition though in hell
better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
but wherefore let we then our faithful friends
th associates and copartners of our loss
lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool
and call them not to share with us their part
in this unhappy mansion or once more
with rallied arms to try what may be yet
regained in heaven or what more lost in hell
    so satan spake and him beelzebub
thus answeredleader of those armies bright
which but th omnipotent none could have foiled
if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft
in worst extremes and on the perilous edge
of battle when it raged in all assaults
their surest signalthey will soon resume
new courage and revive though now they lie
grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire
as we erewhile astounded and amazed
no wonder fallen such a pernicious height
    he scarce had ceased when the superior fiend
was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield
ethereal temper massy large and round
behind him cast the broad circumference
hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
through optic glass the tuscan artist views
at evening from the top of fesole
or in valdarno to descry new lands
rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
his spearto equal which the tallest pine
hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast
of some great ammiral were but a wand
he walked with to support uneasy steps
over the burning marl not like those steps
on heavens azure and the torrid clime
smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
nathless he so endured till on the beach
of that inflamed sea he stood and called
his legionsangel forms who lay entranced
thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades
high overarched embower or scattered sedge
afloat when with fierce winds orion armed
hath vexed the redsea coast whose waves oerthrew
busiris and his memphian chivalry
while with perfidious hatred they pursued
the sojourners of goshen who beheld
from the safe shore their floating carcases
and broken chariotwheels so thick bestrown
abject and lost lay these covering the flood
under amazement of their hideous change
he called so loud that all the hollow deep
of hell resoundedprinces potentates
warriors the flower of heavenonce yours now lost
if such astonishment as this can seize
eternal spirits or have ye chosen this place
after the toil of battle to repose
your wearied virtue for the ease you find
to slumber here as in the vales of heaven
or in this abject posture have ye sworn
to adore the conqueror who now beholds
cherub and seraph rolling in the flood
with scattered arms and ensigns till anon
his swift pursuers from heavengates discern
th advantage and descending tread us down
thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
transfix us to the bottom of this gulf
awake arise or be for ever fallen
    they heard and were abashed and up they sprung
upon the wing as when men wont to watch
on duty sleeping found by whom they dread
rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake
nor did they not perceive the evil plight
in which they were or the fierce pains not feel
yet to their generals voice they soon obeyed
innumerable as when the potent rod
of amrams son in egypts evil day
waved round the coast upcalled a pitchy cloud
of locusts warping on the eastern wind
that oer the realm of impious pharaoh hung
like night and darkened all the land of nile
so numberless were those bad angels seen
hovering on wing under the cope of hell
twixt upper nether and surrounding fires
till as a signal given th uplifted spear
of their great sultan waving to direct
their course in even balance down they light
on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain
a multitude like which the populous north
poured never from her frozen loins to pass
rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons
came like a deluge on the south and spread
beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands
forthwith form every squadron and each band
the heads and leaders thither haste where stood
their great commandergodlike shapes and forms
excelling human princely dignities
and powers that erst in heaven sat on thrones
though on their names in heavenly records now
be no memorial blotted out and rased
by their rebellion from the books of life
nor had they yet among the sons of eve
got them new names till wandering oer the earth
through gods high sufferance for the trial of man
by falsities and lies the greatest part
of mankind they corrupted to forsake
god their creator and th invisible
glory of him that made them to transform
oft to the image of a brute adorned
with gay religions full of pomp and gold
and devils to adore for deities
then were they known to men by various names
and various idols through the heathen world
    say muse their names then known who first who last
roused from the slumber on that fiery couch
at their great emperorrs call as next in worth
came singly where he stood on the bare strand
while the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof
    the chief were those who from the pit of hell
roaming to seek their prey on earth durst fix
their seats long after next the seat of god
their altars by his altar gods adored
among the nations round and durst abide
jehovah thundering out of sion throned
between the cherubim yea often placed
within his sanctuary itself their shrines
abominations and with cursed things
his holy rites and solemn feasts profaned
and with their darkness durst affront his light
first moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
of human sacrifice and parents tears
though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud
their childrens cries unheard that passed through fire
to his grim idol him the ammonite
worshiped in rabba and her watery plain
in argob and in basan to the stream
of utmost arnon nor content with such
audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
of solomon he led by fraud to build
his temple right against the temple of god
on that opprobrious hill and made his grove
the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence
and black gehenna called the type of hell
next chemos th obscene dread of moabs sons
from aroar to nebo and the wild
of southmost abarim in hesebon
and horonaim seons real beyond
the flowery dale of sibma clad with vines
and eleale to th asphaltic pool
peor his other name when he enticed
israel in sittim on their march from nile
to do him wanton rites which cost them woe
yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
even to that hill of scandal by the grove
of moloch homicide lust hard by hate
till good josiah drove them thence to hell
with these came they who from the bordering flood
of old euphrates to the brook that parts
egypt from syrian ground had general names
of baalim and ashtaroththose male
these feminine for spirits when they please
can either sex assume or both so soft
and uncompounded is their essence pure
not tried or manacled with joint or limb
nor founded on the brittle strength of bones
like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose
dilated or condensed bright or obscure
can execute their airy purposes
and works of love or enmity fulfil
for those the race of israel oft forsook
their living strength and unfrequented left
his righteous altar bowing lowly down
to bestial gods for which their heads as low
bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
of despicable foes with these in troop
came astoreth whom the phoenicians called
astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns
to whose bright image nightly by the moon
sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs
in sion also not unsung where stood
her temple on th offensive mountain built
by that uxorious king whose heart though large
beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
to idols foul thammuz came next behind
whose annual wound in lebanon allured
the syrian damsels to lament his fate
in amorous ditties all a summers day
while smooth adonis from his native rock
ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
of thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale
infected sions daughters with like heat
whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
ezekiel saw when by the vision led
his eye surveyed the dark idolatries
of alienated judah next came one
who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off
in his own temple on the grunseledge
where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers
dagon his name seamonster upward man
and downward fish yet had his temple high
reared in azotus dreaded through the coast
of palestine in gath and ascalon
and accaron and gazas frontier bounds
him followed rimmon whose delightful seat
was fair damascus on the fertile banks
of abbana and pharphar lucid streams
he also against the house of god was bold
a leper once he lost and gained a king
ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
gods altar to disparage and displace
for one of syrian mode whereon to burn
his odious offerings and adore the gods
whom he had vanquished after these appeared
a crew who under names of old renown
osiris isis orus and their train
with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
fanatic egypt and her priests to seek
their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
rather than human nor did israel scape
th infection when their borrowed gold composed
the calf in oreb and the rebel king
doubled that sin in bethel and in dan
likening his maker to the grazed ox
jehovah who in one night when he passed
from egypt marching equalled with one stroke
both her firstborn and all her bleating gods
belial came last than whom a spirit more lewd
fell not from heaven or more gross to love
vice for itself to him no temple stood
or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
in temples and at altars when the priest
turns atheist as did elis sons who filled
with lust and violence the house of god
in courts and palaces he also reigns
and in luxurious cities where the noise
of riot ascends above their loftiest towers
and injury and outrage and when night
darkens the streets then wander forth the sons
of belial flown with insolence and wine
witness the streets of sodom and that night
in gibeah when the hospitable door
exposed a matron to avoid worse rape
    these were the prime in order and in might
the rest were long to tell though far renowned
th ionian godsof javans issue held
gods yet confessed later than heaven and earth
their boasted parentstitan heavens firstborn
with his enormous brood and birthright seized
by younger saturn he from mightier jove
his own and rheas son like measure found
so jove usurping reigned these first in crete
and ida known thence on the snowy top
of cold olympus ruled the middle air
their highest heaven or on the delphian cliff
or in dodona and through all the bounds
of doric land or who with saturn old
fled over adria to th hesperian fields
and oer the celtic roamed the utmost isles
    all these and more came flocking but with looks
downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared
obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their chief
not in despair to have found themselves not lost
in loss itself which on his countenance cast
like doubtful hue but he his wonted pride
soon recollecting with high words that bore
semblance of worth not substance gently raised
their fainting courage and dispelled their fears
then straight commands that at the warlike sound
of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared
his mighty standard that proud honour claimed
azazel as his right a cherub tall
who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
th imperial ensign which full high advanced
shone like a meteor streaming to the wind
with gems and golden lustre rich emblazed
seraphic arms and trophies all the while
sonorous metal blowing martial sounds
at which the universal host upsent
a shout that tore hells concave and beyond
frighted the reign of chaos and old night
all in a moment through the gloom were seen
ten thousand banners rise into the air
with orient colours waving with them rose
a forest huge of spears and thronging helms
appeared and serried shields in thick array
of depth immeasurable anon they move
in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood
of flutes and soft recorderssuch as raised
to height of noblest temper heroes old
arming to battle and instead of rage
deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved
with dread of death to flight or foul retreat
nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase
anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
from mortal or immortal minds thus they
breathing united force with fixed thought
moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
their painful steps oer the burnt soil and now
advanced in view they standa horrid front
of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise
of warriors old with ordered spear and shield
awaiting what command their mighty chief
had to impose he through the armed files
darts his experienced eye and soon traverse
the whole battalion viewstheir order due
their visages and stature as of gods
their number last he sums and now his heart
distends with pride and hardening in his strength
glories for never since created man
met such embodied force as named with these
could merit more than that small infantry
warred on by cranesthough all the giant brood
of phlegra with th heroic race were joined
that fought at thebes and ilium on each side
mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds
in fable or romance of uthers son
begirt with british and armoric knights
and all who since baptized or infidel
jousted in aspramont or montalban
damasco or marocco or trebisond
or whom biserta sent from afric shore
when charlemain with all his peerage fell
by fontarabbia thus far these beyond
compare of mortal prowess yet observed
their dread commander he above the rest
in shape and gesture proudly eminent
stood like a tower his form had yet not lost
all her original brightness nor appeared
less than archangel ruined and th excess
of glory obscured as when the sun newrisen
looks through the horizontal misty air
shorn of his beams or from behind the moon
in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
on half the nations and with fear of change
perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone
above them all th archangel but his face
deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care
sat on his faded cheek but under brows
of dauntless courage and considerate pride
waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast
signs of remorse and passion to behold
the fellows of his crime the followers rather
 condemned
for ever now to have their lot in pain
millions of spirits for his fault amerced
of heaven and from eternal splendours flung
for his revoltyet faithful how they stood
their glory withered as when heavens fire
hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines
with singed top their stately growth though bare
stands on the blasted heath he now prepared
to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
from wing to wing and half enclose him round
with all his peers attention held them mute
thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn
tears such as angels weep burst forth at last
words interwove with sighs found out their way
    o myriads of immortal spirits o powers
matchless but with th almightyand that strife
was not inglorious though th event was dire
as this place testifies and this dire change
hateful to utter but what power of mind
forseeing or presaging from the depth
of knowledge past or present could have feared
how such united force of gods how such
as stood like these could ever know repulse
for who can yet believe though after loss
that all these puissant legions whose exile
hath emptied heaven shall fail to reascend
selfraised and repossess their native seat
for me be witness all the host of heaven
if counsels different or danger shunned
by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns
monarch in heaven till then as one secure
sat on his throne upheld by old repute
consent or custom and his regal state
put forth at full but still his strength concealed
which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
henceforth his might we know and know our own
so as not either to provoke or dread
new war provoked our better part remains
to work in close design by fraud or guile
what force effected not that he no less
at length from us may find who overcomes
by force hath overcome but half his foe
space may produce new worlds whereof so rife
there went a fame in heaven that he ere long
intended to create and therein plant
a generation whom his choice regard
should favour equal to the sons of heaven
thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
our first eruptionthither or elsewhere
for this infernal pit shall never hold
celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss
long under darkness cover but these thoughts
full counsel must mature peace is despaired
for who can think submission war then war
open or understood must be resolved
    he spake and to confirm his words outflew
millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze
far round illumined hell highly they raged
against the highest and fierce with grasped arms
clashed on their sounding shields the din of war
hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven
    there stood a hill not far whose grisly top
belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
shone with a glossy scurfundoubted sign
that in his womb was hid metallic ore
the work of sulphur thither winged with speed
a numerous brigade hastened as when bands
of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed
forerun the royal camp to trench a field
or cast a rampart mammon led them on
mammon the least erected spirit that fell
from heaven for even in heaven his looks and thoughts
were always downward bent admiring more
the riches of heavens pavement trodden gold
than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
in vision beatific by him first
men also and by his suggestion taught
ransacked the centre and with impious hands
rifled the bowels of their mother earth
for treasures better hid soon had his crew
opened into the hill a spacious wound
and digged out ribs of gold let none admire
that riches grow in hell that soil may best
deserve the precious bane and here let those
who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
of babel and the works of memphian kings
learn how their greatest monuments of fame
and strength and art are easily outdone
by spirits reprobate and in an hour
what in an age they with incessant toil
and hands innumerable scarce perform
nigh on the plain in many cells prepared
that underneath had veins of liquid fire
sluiced from the lake a second multitude
with wondrous art founded the massy ore
severing each kind and scummed the bulliondross
a third as soon had formed within the ground
a various mould and from the boiling cells
by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook
as in an organ from one blast of wind
to many a row of pipes the soundboard breathes
anon out of the earth a fabric huge
rose like an exhalation with the sound
of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet
built like a temple where pilasters round
were set and doric pillars overlaid
with golden architrave nor did there want
cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven
the roof was fretted gold not babylon
nor great alcairo such magnificence
equalled in all their glories to enshrine
belus or serapis their gods or seat
their kings when egypt with assyria strove
in wealth and luxury th ascending pile
stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors
opening their brazen folds discover wide
within her ample spaces oer the smooth
and level pavement from the arched roof
pendent by subtle magic many a row
of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
with naptha and asphaltus yielded light
as from a sky the hasty multitude
admiring entered and the work some praise
and some the architect his hand was known
in heaven by many a towered structure high
where sceptred angels held their residence
and sat as princes whom the supreme king
exalted to such power and gave to rule
each in his hierarchy the orders bright
nor was his name unheard or unadored
in ancient greece and in ausonian land
men called him mulciber and how he fell
from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove
sheer oer the crystal battlements from morn
to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve
a summers day and with the setting sun
dropt from the zenith like a falling star
on lemnos th aegaean isle thus they relate
erring for he with this rebellious rout
fell long before nor aught availed him now
to have built in heaven high towers nor did he scape
by all his engines but was headlong sent
with his industrious crew to build in hell
    meanwhile the winged heralds by command
of sovereign power with awful ceremony
and trumpets sound throughout the host proclaim
a solemn council forthwith to be held
at pandemonium the high capital
of satan and his peers their summons called
from every band and squared regiment
by place or choice the worthiest they anon
with hundreds and with thousands trooping came
attended all access was thronged the gates
and porches wide but chief the spacious hall

thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air
brushed with the hiss of rustling wings as bees
in springtime when the sun with taurus rides
pour forth their populous youth about the hive
in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank
the suburb of their strawbuilt citadel
new rubbed with balm expatiate and confer
their stateaffairs so thick the airy crowd
swarmed and were straitened till the signal given
behold a wonder they but now who seemed
in bigness to surpass earths giant sons
now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room
throng numberlesslike that pygmean race
beyond the indian mount or faery elves
whose midnight revels by a forestside
or fountain some belated peasant sees
or dreams he sees while overhead the moon
sits arbitress and nearer to the earth
wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
intent with jocund music charm his ear
at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds
thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms
reduced their shapes immense and were at large
though without number still amidst the hall
of that infernal court but far within
and in their own dimensions like themselves
the great seraphic lords and cherubim
in close recess and secret conclave sat
a thousand demigods on golden seats
frequent and full after short silence then
and summons read the great consult began





high on a throne of royal state which far
outshone the wealth of ormus and of ind
or where the gorgeous east with richest hand
showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold
satan exalted sat by merit raised
to that bad eminence and from despair
thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
vain war with heaven and by success untaught
his proud imaginations thus displayed
    powers and dominions deities of heaven
for since no deep within her gulf can hold
immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen
i give not heaven for lost from this descent
celestial virtues rising will appear
more glorious and more dread than from no fall
and trust themselves to fear no second fate
me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven
did first create your leadernext free choice
with what besides in council or in fight
hath been achieved of merityet this loss
thus far at least recovered hath much more
established in a safe unenvied throne
yielded with full consent the happier state
in heaven which follows dignity might draw
envy from each inferior but who here
will envy whom the highest place exposes
foremost to stand against the thunderers aim
your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
of endless pain where there is then no good
for which to strive no strife can grow up there
from faction for none sure will claim in hell
precedence none whose portion is so small
of present pain that with ambitious mind
will covet more with this advantage then
to union and firm faith and firm accord
more than can be in heaven we now return
to claim our just inheritance of old
surer to prosper than prosperity
could have assured us and by what best way
whether of open war or covert guile
we now debate who can advise may speak
    he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king
stood upthe strongest and the fiercest spirit
that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair
his trust was with th eternal to be deemed
equal in strength and rather than be less
cared not to be at all with that care lost
went all his fear of god or hell or worse
he recked not and these words thereafter spake
    my sentence is for open war of wiles
more unexpert i boast not them let those
contrive who need or when they need not now
for while they sit contriving shall the rest
millions that stand in arms and longing wait
the signal to ascendsit lingering here
heavens fugitives and for their dwellingplace
accept this dark opprobrious den of shame
the prison of his tyranny who reigns
by our delay no let us rather choose
armed with hellflames and fury all at once
oer heavens high towers to force resistless way
turning our tortures into horrid arms
against the torturer when to meet the noise
of his almighty engine he shall hear
infernal thunder and for lightning see
black fire and horror shot with equal rage
among his angels and his throne itself
mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire
his own invented torments but perhaps
the way seems difficult and steep to scale
with upright wing against a higher foe
let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
of that forgetful lake benumb not still
that in our proper motion we ascend
up to our native seat descent and fall
to us is adverse who but felt of late
when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
insulting and pursued us through the deep
with what compulsion and laborious flight
we sunk thus low th ascent is easy then
th event is feared should we again provoke
our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
to our destruction if there be in hell
fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse
than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
in this abhorred deep to utter woe
where pain of unextinguishable fire
must exercise us without hope of end
the vassals of his anger when the scourge
inexorably and the torturing hour
calls us to penance more destroyed than thus
we should be quite abolished and expire
what fear we then what doubt we to incense
his utmost ire which to the height enraged
will either quite consume us and reduce
to nothing this essentialhappier far
than miserable to have eternal being
or if our substance be indeed divine
and cannot cease to be we are at worst
on this side nothing and by proof we feel
our power sufficient to disturb his heaven
and with perpetual inroads to alarm
though inaccessible his fatal throne
which if not victory is yet revenge
    he ended frowning and his look denounced
desperate revenge and battle dangerous
to less than gods on th other side up rose
belial in act more graceful and humane
a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed
for dignity composed and high exploit
but all was false and hollow though his tongue
dropped manna and could make the worse appear
the better reason to perplex and dash
maturest counsels for his thoughts were low
to vice industrious but to nobler deeds
timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear
and with persuasive accent thus began
    i should be much for open war o peers
as not behind in hate if what was urged
main reason to persuade immediate war
did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
ominous conjecture on the whole success
when he who most excels in fact of arms
in what he counsels and in what excels
mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
and utter dissolution as the scope
of all his aim after some dire revenge
first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled
with armed watch that render all access
impregnable oft on the bordering deep
encamp their legions or with obscure wing
scout far and wide into the realm of night
scorning surprise or could we break our way
by force and at our heels all hell should rise
with blackest insurrection to confound
heavens purest light yet our great enemy
all incorruptible would on his throne
sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
incapable of stain would soon expel
her mischief and purge off the baser fire
victorious thus repulsed our final hope
is flat despair we must exasperate
th almighty victor to spend all his rage
and that must end us that must be our cure
to be no more sad cure for who would lose
though full of pain this intellectual being
those thoughts that wander through eternity
to perish rather swallowed up and lost
in the wide womb of uncreated night
devoid of sense and motion and who knows
let this be good whether our angry foe
can give it or will ever how he can
is doubtful that he never will is sure
will he so wise let loose at once his ire
belike through impotence or unaware
to give his enemies their wish and end
them in his anger whom his anger saves
to punish endless wherefore cease we then
say they who counsel war we are decreed
reserved and destined to eternal woe
whatever doing what can we suffer more
what can we suffer worse is this then worst
thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms
what when we fled amain pursued and struck
with heavens afflicting thunder and besought
the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed
a refuge from those wounds or when we lay
chained on the burning lake that sure was worse
what if the breath that kindled those grim fires
awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage
and plunge us in the flames or from above
should intermitted vengeance arm again
his red right hand to plague us what if all
her stores were opened and this firmament
of hell should spout her cataracts of fire
impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
one day upon our heads while we perhaps
designing or exhorting glorious war
caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled
each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains
there to converse with everlasting groans
unrespited unpitied unreprieved
ages of hopeless end this would be worse
war therefore open or concealed alike
my voice dissuades for what can force or guile
with him or who deceive his mind whose eye
views all things at one view he from heavens height
all these our motions vain sees and derides
not more almighty to resist our might
than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles
shall we then live thus vilethe race of heaven
thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
chains and these torments better these than worse
by my advice since fate inevitable
subdues us and omnipotent decree
the victors will to suffer as to do
our strength is equal nor the law unjust
that so ordains this was at first resolved
if we were wise against so great a foe
contending and so doubtful what might fall
i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
what yet they know must followto endure
exile or ignominy or bonds or pain
the sentence of their conqueror this is now
our doom which if we can sustain and bear
our supreme foe in time may much remit
his anger and perhaps thus far removed
not mind us not offending satisfied
with what is punished whence these raging fires
will slacken if his breath stir not their flames
our purer essence then will overcome
their noxious vapour or inured not feel
or changed at length and to the place conformed
in temper and in nature will receive
familiar the fierce heat and void of pain
this horror will grow mild this darkness light
besides what hope the neverending flight
of future days may bring what chance what change
worth waitingsince our present lot appears
for happy though but ill for ill not worst
if we procure not to ourselves more woe
    thus belial with words clothed in reasons garb
counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth
not peace and after him thus mammon spake
    either to disenthrone the king of heaven
we war if war be best or to regain
our own right lost him to unthrone we then
may hope when everlasting fate shall yield
to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife
the former vain to hope argues as vain
the latter for what place can be for us
within heavens bound unless heavens lord supreme
we overpower suppose he should relent
and publish grace to all on promise made
of new subjection with what eyes could we
stand in his presence humble and receive
strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing
forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers
our servile offerings this must be our task
in heaven this our delight how wearisome
eternity so spent in worship paid
to whom we hate let us not then pursue
by force impossible by leave obtained
unacceptable though in heaven our state
of splendid vassalage but rather seek
our own good from ourselves and from our own
live to ourselves though in this vast recess
free and to none accountable preferring
hard liberty before the easy yoke
of servile pomp our greatness will appear
then most conspicuous when great things of small
useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
we can create and in what place soeer
thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
through labour and endurance this deep world
of darkness do we dread how oft amidst
thick clouds and dark doth heavens allruling sire
choose to reside his glory unobscured
and with the majesty of darkness round
covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell
as he our darkness cannot we his light
imitate when we please this desert soil
wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold
nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
magnificence and what can heaven show more
our torments also may in length of time
become our elements these piercing fires
as soft as now severe our temper changed
into their temper which must needs remove
the sensible of pain all things invite
to peaceful counsels and the settled state
of order how in safety best we may
compose our present evils with regard
of what we are and where dismissing quite
all thoughts of war ye have what i advise
    he scarce had finished when such murmur filled
th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
the sound of blustering winds which all night long
had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
seafaring men oerwatched whose bark by chance
or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
after the tempest such applause was heard
as mammon ended and his sentence pleased
advising peace for such another field
they dreaded worse than hell so much the fear
of thunder and the sword of michael
wrought still within them and no less desire
to found this nether empire which might rise
by policy and long process of time
in emulation opposite to heaven
which when beelzebub perceivedthan whom
satan except none higher satwith grave
aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
a pillar of state deep on his front engraven
deliberation sat and public care
and princely counsel in his face yet shone
majestic though in ruin sage he stood
with atlantean shoulders fit to bear
the weight of mightiest monarchies his look
drew audience and attention still as night
or summers noontide air while thus he spake
    thrones and imperial powers offspring of heaven
ethereal virtues or these titles now
must we renounce and changing style be called
princes of hell for so the popular vote
inclineshere to continue and build up here
a growing empire doubtless while we dream
and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed
this place our dungeon not our safe retreat
beyond his potent arm to live exempt
from heavens high jurisdiction in new league
banded against his throne but to remain
in strictest bondage though thus far removed
under th inevitable curb reserved
his captive multitude for he to be sure
in height or depth still first and last will reign
sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
by our revolt but over hell extend
his empire and with iron sceptre rule
us here as with his golden those in heaven
what sit we then projecting peace and war
war hath determined us and foiled with loss
irreparable terms of peace yet none
vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
to us enslaved but custody severe
and stripes and arbitrary punishment
inflicted and what peace can we return
but to our power hostility and hate
untamed reluctance and revenge though slow
yet ever plotting how the conqueror least
may reap his conquest and may least rejoice
in doing what we most in suffering feel
nor will occasion want nor shall we need
with dangerous expedition to invade
heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege
or ambush from the deep what if we find
some easier enterprise there is a place
another world the happy seat
of some new race called man about this time
to be created like to us though less
in power and excellence but favoured more
of him who rules above so was his will
pronounced among the gods and by an oath
that shook heavens whole circumference confirmed
thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
what creatures there inhabit of what mould
or substance how endued and what their power
and where their weakness how attempted best
by force of subtlety though heaven be shut
and heavens high arbitrator sit secure
in his own strength this place may lie exposed
the utmost border of his kingdom left
to their defence who hold it here perhaps
some advantageous act may be achieved
by sudden onseteither with hellfire
to waste his whole creation or possess
all as our own and drive as we were driven
the puny habitants or if not drive
seduce them to our party that their god
may prove their foe and with repenting hand
abolish his own works this would surpass
common revenge and interrupt his joy
in our confusion and our joy upraise
in his disturbance when his darling sons
hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
their frail original and faded bliss
faded so soon advise if this be worth
attempting or to sit in darkness here
hatching vain empires thus beelzebub
pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised
by satan and in part proposed for whence
but from the author of all ill could spring
so deep a malice to confound the race
of mankind in one root and earth with hell
to mingle and involve done all to spite
the great creator but their spite still serves
his glory to augment the bold design
pleased highly those infernal states and joy
sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
they vote whereat his speech he thus renews
well have ye judged well ended long debate
synod of gods and like to what ye are
great things resolved which from the lowest deep
will once more lift us up in spite of fate
nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view
of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
and opportune excursion we may chance
reenter heaven or else in some mild zone
dwell not unvisited of heavens fair light
secure and at the brightening orient beam
purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
to heal the scar of these corrosive fires
shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send
in search of this new world whom shall we find
sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet
the dark unbottomed infinite abyss
and through the palpable obscure find out
his uncouth way or spread his airy flight
upborne with indefatigable wings
over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
the happy isle what strength what art can then
suffice or what evasion bear him safe
through the strict senteries and stations thick
of angels watching round here he had need
all circumspection and we now no less
choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
the weight of all and our last hope relies
    this said he sat and expectation held
his look suspense awaiting who appeared
to second or oppose or undertake
the perilous attempt but all sat mute
pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
in others countenance read his own dismay
astonished none among the choice and prime
of those heavenwarring champions could be found
so hardy as to proffer or accept
alone the dreadful voyage till at last
satan whom now transcendent glory raised
above his fellows with monarchal pride
conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake
    o progeny of heaven empyreal thrones
with reason hath deep silence and demur
seized us though undismayed long is the way
and hard that out of hell leads up to light
our prison strong this huge convex of fire
outrageous to devour immures us round
ninefold and gates of burning adamant
barred over us prohibit all egress
these passed if any pass the void profound
of unessential night receives him next
widegaping and with utter loss of being
threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf
if thence he scape into whatever world
or unknown region what remains him less
than unknown dangers and as hard escape
but i should ill become this throne o peers
and this imperial sovereignty adorned
with splendour armed with power if aught proposed
and judged of public moment in the shape
of difficulty or danger could deter
me from attempting wherefore do i assume
these royalties and not refuse to reign
refusing to accept as great a share
of hazard as of honour due alike
to him who reigns and so much to him due
of hazard more as he above the rest
high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers
terror of heaven though fallen intend at home
while here shall be our home what best may ease
the present misery and render hell
more tolerable if there be cure or charm
to respite or deceive or slack the pain
of this ill mansion intermit no watch
against a wakeful foe while i abroad
through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
deliverance for us all this enterprise
none shall partake with me thus saying rose
the monarch and prevented all reply
prudent lest from his resolution raised
others among the chief might offer now
certain to be refused what erst they feared
and so refused might in opinion stand
his rivals winning cheap the high repute
which he through hazard huge must earn but they
dreaded not more th adventure than his voice
forbidding and at once with him they rose
their rising all at once was as the sound
of thunder heard remote towards him they bend
with awful reverence prone and as a god
extol him equal to the highest in heaven
nor failed they to express how much they praised
that for the general safety he despised
his own for neither do the spirits damned
lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
their specious deeds on earth which glory excites
or close ambition varnished oer with zeal
    thus they their doubtful consultations dark
ended rejoicing in their matchless chief
as when from mountaintops the dusky clouds
ascending while the north wind sleeps oerspread
heavens cheerful face the louring element
scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower
if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
extend his evening beam the fields revive
the birds their notes renew and bleating herds
attest their joy that hill and valley rings
o shame to men devil with devil damned
firm concord holds men only disagree
of creatures rational though under hope
of heavenly grace and god proclaiming peace
yet live in hatred enmity and strife
among themselves and levy cruel wars
wasting the earth each other to destroy
as if 
man had not hellish foes enow besides
that day and night for his destruction wait
    the stygian council thus dissolved and forth
in order came the grand infernal peers
midst came their mighty paramount and seemed
alone th antagonist of heaven nor less
than hells dread emperor with pomp supreme
and godlike imitated state him round
a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed
with bright emblazonry and horrent arms
then of their session ended they bid cry
with trumpets regal sound the great result
toward the four winds four speedy cherubim
put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
by heralds voice explained the hollow abyss
heard far and wide and all the host of hell
with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
by false presumptuous hope the ranged powers
disband and wandering each his several way
pursues as inclination or sad choice
leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
the irksome hours till his great chief return
part on the plain or in the air sublime
upon the wing or in swift race contend
as at th olympian games or pythian fields
part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form
as when to warn proud cities war appears
waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
to battle in the clouds before each van
prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears
till thickest legions close with feats of arms
from either end of heaven the welkin burns
others with vast typhoean rage more fell
rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar
as when alcides from oechalia crowned
with conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore
through pain up by the roots thessalian pines
and lichas from the top of oeta threw
into th euboic sea others more mild
retreated in a silent valley sing
with notes angelical to many a harp
their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
by doom of battle and complain that fate
free virtue should enthrall to force or chance
their song was partial but the harmony

suspended hell and took with ravishment
the thronging audience in discourse more sweet

others apart sat on a hill retired
in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
of providence foreknowledge will and fate
fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute
and found no end in wandering mazes lost
of good and evil much they argued then
of happiness and final misery
passion and apathy and glory and shame
vain wisdom all and false philosophy
yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
pain for a while or anguish and excite
fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast
with stubborn patience as with triple steel
another part in squadrons and gross bands
on bold adventure to discover wide
that dismal world if any clime perhaps
might yield them easier habitation bend
four ways their flying march along the banks
of four infernal rivers that disgorge
into the burning lake their baleful streams
abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate
sad acheron of sorrow black and deep
cocytus named of lamentation loud
heard on the rueful stream fierce phlegeton
whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage
far off from these a slow and silent stream
lethe the river of oblivion rolls
her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
forthwith his former state and being forgets
forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain
beyond this flood a frozen continent
lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice
a gulf profound as that serbonian bog
betwixt damiata and mount casius old
where armies whole have sunk the parching air
burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire
thither by harpyfooted furies haled
at certain revolutions all the damned
are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce
from beds of raging fire to starve in ice
their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
immovable infixed and frozen round
periods of timethence hurried back to fire
they ferry over this lethean sound
both to and fro their sorrow to augment
and wish and struggle as they pass to reach
the tempting stream with one small drop to lose
in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe
all in one moment and so near the brink
but fate withstands and to oppose th attempt
medusa with gorgonian terror guards
the ford and of itself the water flies
all taste of living wight as once it fled
the lip of tantalus thus roving on
in confused march forlorn th adventurous bands
with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast
viewed first their lamentable lot and found
no rest through many a dark and dreary vale
they passed and many a region dolorous
oer many a frozen many a fiery alp
rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death
a universe of death which god by curse
created evil for evil only good
where all life dies death lives and nature breeds
perverse all monstrous all prodigious things
obominable inutterable and worse
than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived
gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire
    meanwhile the adversary of god and man
satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design
puts on swift wings and toward the gates of hell
explores his solitary flight sometimes
he scours the right hand coast sometimes the left
now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
up to the fiery concave towering high
as when far off at sea a fleet descried
hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
close sailing from bengala or the isles
of ternate and tidore whence merchants bring
their spicy drugs they on the trading flood
through the wide ethiopian to the cape
ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
far off the flying fiend at last appear
hellbounds high reaching to the horrid roof
and thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass
three iron three of adamantine rock
impenetrable impaled with circling fire
yet unconsumed before the gates there sat
on either side a formidable shape
the one seemed woman to the waist and fair
but ended foul in many a scaly fold
voluminous and vasta serpent armed
with mortal sting about her middle round
a cry of hellhounds neverceasing barked
with wide cerberean mouths full loud and rung
a hideous peal yet when they list would creep
if aught disturbed their noise into her womb
and kennel there yet there still barked and howled
within unseen far less abhorred than these
vexed scylla bathing in the sea that parts
calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore
nor uglier follow the nighthag when called
in secret riding through the air she comes
lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
with lapland witches while the labouring moon
eclipses at their charms the other shape
if shape it might be called that shape had none
distinguishable in member joint or limb
or substance might be called that shadow seemed
for each seemed eitherblack it stood as night
fierce as ten furies terrible as hell
and shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
the likeness of a kingly crown had on
satan was now at hand and from his seat
the monster moving onward came as fast
with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode
th undaunted fiend what this might be admired
admired not feared 
and with disdainful look thus first began
    whence and what art thou execrable shape
that darst though grim and terrible advance
thy miscreated front athwart my way
to yonder gates through them i mean to pass
that be assured without leave asked of thee
retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
hellborn not to contend with spirits of heaven
    to whom the goblin full of wrath replied
art thou that traitor angel art thou he
who first broke peace in heaven and faith till then
unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
drew after him the third part of heavens sons
conjured against the highestfor which both thou
and they outcast from god are here condemned
to waste eternal days in woe and pain
and reckonst thou thyself with spirits of heaven
helldoomed and breathst defiance here and scorn
where i reign king and to enrage thee more
thy king and lord back to thy punishment
false fugitive and to thy speed add wings
lest with a whip of scorpions i pursue
thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before
    so spake the grisly terror and in shape
so speaking and so threatening grew tenfold
more dreadful and deform on th other side
incensed with indignation satan stood
unterrified and like a comet burned
that fires the length of ophiuchus huge
in th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
shakes pestilence and war each at the head
levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
no second stroke intend and such a frown
each cast at th other as when two black clouds
with heavens artillery fraught came rattling on
over the caspianthen stand front to front
hovering a space till winds the signal blow
to join their dark encounter in midair
so frowned the mighty combatants that hell
grew darker at their frown so matched they stood
for never but once more was wither like
to meet so great a foe and now great deeds
had been achieved whereof all hell had rung
had not the snaky sorceress that sat
fast by hellgate and kept the fatal key
risen and with hideous outcry rushed between
    o father what intends thy hand she cried
against thy only son what fury o son
possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
against thy fathers head and knowst for whom
for him who sits above and laughs the while
at thee ordained his drudge to execute
whateer his wrath which he calls justice bids
his wrath which one day will destroy ye both
    she spake and at her words the hellish pest
forbore then these to her satan returned
    so strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
thou interposest that my sudden hand
prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
what it intends till first i know of thee
what thing thou art thus doubleformed and why
in this infernal vale first met thou callst
me father and that phantasm callst my son
i know thee not nor ever saw till now
sight more detestable than him and thee
    t whom thus the portress of hellgate replied
hast thou forgot me then and do i seem
now in thine eye so foulonce deemed so fair
in heaven when at th assembly and in sight
of all the seraphim with thee combined
in bold conspiracy against heavens king
all on a sudden miserable pain
surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
in darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
threw forth till on the left side opening wide
likest to thee in shape and countenance bright
then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed
out of thy head i sprung amazement seized
all th host of heaven back they recoiled afraid
at first and called me sin and for a sign
portentous held me but familiar grown
i pleased and with attractive graces won
the most aversethee chiefly who full oft
thyself in me thy perfect image viewing
becamst enamoured and such joy thou tookst
with me in secret that my womb conceived
a growing burden meanwhile war arose
and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained
 to our almighty foe
clear victory to our part loss and rout
through all the empyrean down they fell
driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down
into this deep and in the general fall
i also at which time this powerful key
into my hands was given with charge to keep
these gates for ever shut which none can pass
without my opening pensive here i sat
alone but long i sat not till my womb
pregnant by thee and now excessive grown
prodigious motion felt and rueful throes
at last this odious offspring whom thou seest
thine own begotten breaking violent way
tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
distorted all my nether shape thus grew
transformed but he my inbred enemy
forth issued brandishing his fatal dart
made to destroy i fled and cried out death
hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
from all her caves and back resounded death
i fled but he pursued  and swifter far
me overtook his mother all dismayed
and in embraces forcible and foul
engendering with me of that rape begot
these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
surround me as thou sawsthourly conceived
and hourly born with sorrow infinite
to me for when they list into the womb
that bred them they return and howl and gnaw
my bowels their repast then bursting forth
afresh with conscious terrors vex me round
that rest or intermission none i find
before mine eyes in opposition sits
grim death my son and foe who set them on
and me his parent would full soon devour
for want of other prey but that he knows
his end with mine involved and knows that i
should prove a bitter morsel and his bane
whenever that shall be so fate pronounced
but thou o father i forewarn thee shun
his deadly arrow neither vainly hope
to be invulnerable in those bright arms
through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint
save he who reigns above none can resist
    she finished and the subtle fiend his lore
soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth
    dear daughtersince thou claimst me for thy sire
and my fair son here showst me the dear pledge
of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys
then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
befallen us unforeseen unthoughtofknow
i come no enemy but to set free
from out this dark and dismal house of pain
both him and thee and all the heavenly host
of spirits that in our just pretences armed
fell with us from on high from them i go
this uncouth errand sole and one for all
myself expose with lonely steps to tread
th unfounded deep and through the void immense
to search with wandering quest a place foretold
should beand by concurring signs ere now
created vast and rounda place of bliss
in the purlieus of heaven and therein placed
a race of upstart creatures to supply
perhaps our vacant room though more removed
lest heaven surcharged with potent multitude
might hap to move new broils be this or aught
than this more secret now designed i haste
to know and this once known shall soon return
and bring ye to the place where thou and death
shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
wing silently the buxom air embalmed
with odours there ye shall be fed and filled
immeasurably all things shall be your prey
    he ceased for both seemed highly pleased and death
grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
his famine should be filled and blessed his maw
destined to that good hour no less rejoiced
his mother bad and thus bespake her sire
    the key of this infernal pit by due
and by command of heavens allpowerful king
i keep by him forbidden to unlock
these adamantine gates against all force
death ready stands to interpose his dart
fearless to be oermatched by living might
but what owe i to his commands above
who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
into this gloom of tartarus profound
to sit in hateful office here confined
inhabitant of heaven and heavenly born
here in perpetual agony and pain
with terrors and with clamours compassed round
of mine own brood that on my bowels feed
thou art my father thou my author thou
my being gavst me whom should i obey
but thee whom follow thou wilt bring me soon
to that new world of light and bliss among
the gods who live at ease where i shall reign
at thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
thy daughter and thy darling without end
    thus saying from her side the fatal key
sad instrument of all our woe she took
and towards the gate rolling her bestial train
forthwith the huge portcullis high updrew
which but herself not all the stygian powers
could once have moved then in the keyhole turns
th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
of massy iron or solid rock with ease
unfastens on a sudden open fly
with impetuous recoil and jarring sound
th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
of erebus she opened but to shut
excelled her power the gates wide open stood
that with extended wings a bannered host
under spread ensigns marching might pass through
with horse and chariots ranked in loose array
so wide they stood and like a furnacemouth
cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame
before their eyes in sudden view appear
the secrets of the hoary deepa dark
illimitable ocean without bound
without dimension where length breadth and height
and time and place are lost where eldest night
and chaos ancestors of nature hold
eternal anarchy amidst the noise
of endless wars and by confusion stand
for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce
strive here for mastery and to battle bring
their embryon atoms they around the flag
of each his faction in their several clans
lightarmed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow
swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
of barca or cyrenes torrid soil
levied to side with warring winds and poise
their lighter wings to whom these most adhere
he rules a moment chaos umpire sits
and by decision more embroils the fray
by which he reigns next him high arbiter
chance governs all into this wild abyss
the womb of nature and perhaps her grave
of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire
but all these in their pregnant causes mixed
confusedly and which thus must ever fight
unless th almighty maker them ordain
his dark materials to create more worlds
into this wild abyss the wary fiend
stood on the brink of hell and looked a while
pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed
with noises loud and ruinous  than when bellona storms
with all her battering engines bent to rase
some capital city or less than if this frame
of heaven were falling and these elements
in mutiny had from her axle torn
the steadfast earth at last his sailbroad vans
he spread for flight and in the surging smoke
uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league
as in a cloudy chair ascending rides
audacious but that seat soon failing meets
a vast vacuity all unawares
fluttering his pennons vain plumbdown he drops
ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
down had been falling had not by ill chance
the strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
as many miles aloft that fury stayed
quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea
nor good dry landnigh foundered on he fares
treading the crude consistence half on foot
half flying behoves him now both oar and sail
as when a gryphon through the wilderness
with winged course oer hill or moory dale
pursues the arimaspian who by stealth
had from his wakeful custody purloined
the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend
oer bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare
with head hands wings or feet pursues his way
and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies
at length a universal hubbub wild
of stunning sounds and voices all confused
borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
with loudest vehemence thither he plies
undaunted to meet there whatever power
or spirit of the nethermost abyss
might in that noise reside of whom to ask
which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
bordering on light when straight behold the throne
of chaos and his dark pavilion spread
wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned
sat sablevested night eldest of things
the consort of his reign and by them stood
orcus and ades and the dreaded name
of demogorgon rumour next and chance
and tumult and confusion all embroiled
and discord with a thousand various mouths
    t whom satan turning boldly thusye powers
and spirits of this nethermost abyss
chaos and ancient night i come no spy
with purpose to explore or to disturb
the secrets of your realm but by constraint
wandering this darksome desert as my way
lies through your spacious empire up to light
alone and without guide half lost i seek
what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
confine with heaven or if some other place
from your dominion won th ethereal king
possesses lately thither to arrive
i travel this profound direct my course
directed no mean recompense it brings
to your behoof if i that region lost
all usurpation thence expelled reduce
to her original darkness and your sway
 and once more
erect the standard there of ancient night
yours be th advantage all mine the revenge
    thus satan and him thus the anarch old
with faltering speech and visage incomposed
answered i know thee stranger who thou art
that mighty leading angel who of late
made head against heavens king though overthrown
i saw and heard for such a numerous host
fled not in silence through the frighted deep
with ruin upon ruin rout on rout
confusion worse confounded and heavengates
poured out by millions her victorious bands
pursuing i upon my frontiers here
keep residence if all i can will serve
that little which is left so to defend
encroached on still through our intestine broils
weakening the sceptre of old night first hell
your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath
now lately heaven and earth another world
hung oer my realm linked in a golden chain
to that side heaven from whence your legions fell
if that way be your walk you have not far
so much the nearer danger go and speed
havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain
    he ceased and satan stayed not to reply
but glad that now his sea should find a shore
with fresh alacrity and force renewed
springs upward like a pyramid of fire
into the wild expanse and through the shock
of fighting elements on all sides round
environed wins his way harder beset
and more endangered than when argo passed
through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks
or when ulysses on the larboard shunned
charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered
so he with difficulty and labour hard
moved on with difficulty and labour he
but he once passed soon after when man fell
strange alteration sin and death amain
following his track 
paved after him a broad and beaten way
over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf
tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length
from hell continued reaching th utmost orb
of this frail world by which the spirits perverse
with easy intercourse pass to and fro
to tempt or punish mortals except whom
god and good angels guard by special grace
    but now at last the sacred influence
of light appears and from the walls of heaven
shoots far into the bosom of dim night
a glimmering dawn here nature first begins
her farthest verge and chaos to retire
as from her outmost works a broken foe
with tumult less and with less hostile din
that satan with less toil and now with ease
wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
and like a weatherbeaten vessel holds
gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn
or in the emptier waste resembling air
weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
far off th empyreal heaven extended wide
in circuit undetermined square or round
with opal towers and battlements adorned
of living sapphire once his native seat
and fast by hanging in a golden chain
this pendent world in bigness as a star
of smallest magnitude close by the moon
thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
accursed and in a cursed hour he hies







hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn
or of the eternal coeternal beam
may i express thee unblamd since god is light
and never but in unapproached light
dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
bright effluence of bright essence increate
or hearst thou rather pure ethereal stream
whose fountain who shall tell before the sun
before the heavens thou wert and at the voice
of god as with a mantle didst invest
the rising world of waters dark and deep
won from the void and formless infinite
thee i revisit now with bolder wing
escapd the stygian pool though long detaind
in that obscure sojourn while in my flight
through utter and through middle darkness borne
with other notes than to the orphean lyre
i sung of chaos and eternal night
taught by the heavenly muse to venture down
the dark descent and up to reascend
though hard and rare thee i revisit safe
and feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
revisitst not these eyes that roll in vain
to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
so thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs
or dim suffusion veild yet not the more
cease i to wander where the muses haunt
clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
smit with the love of sacred song but chief
thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath
that wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow
nightly i visit nor sometimes forget
so were i equalld with them in renown
thy sovran command that man should find grace
blind thamyris and blind maeonides
and tiresias and phineus prophets old
then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
tunes her nocturnal note thus with the year
seasons return but not to me returns
day or the sweet approach of even or morn
or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose
or flocks or herds or human face divine
but cloud instead and everduring dark
surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
presented with a universal blank
of natures works to me expungd and rasd
and wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
so much the rather thou celestial light
shine inward and the mind through all her powers
irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
purge and disperse that i may see and tell
of things invisible to mortal sight
now had the almighty father from above
from the pure empyrean where he sits
high thrond above all highth bent down his eye
his own works and their works at once to view
about him all the sanctities of heaven
stood thick as stars and from his sight receivd
beatitude past utterance on his right
the radiant image of his glory sat
his only son on earth he first beheld
our two first parents yet the only two
of mankind in the happy garden placd
reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
uninterrupted joy unrivalld love
in blissful solitude he then surveyd
hell and the gulf between and satan there
coasting the wall of heaven on this side night
in the dun air sublime and ready now
to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
on the bare outside of this world that seemd
firm land imbosomd without firmament
uncertain which in ocean or in air
him god beholding from his prospect high
wherein past present future he beholds
thus to his only son foreseeing spake
only begotten son seest thou what rage
transports our adversary whom no bounds
prescribd no bars of hell nor all the chains
heapd on him there nor yet the main abyss
wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
on desperate revenge that shall redound
upon his own rebellious head and now
through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
not far off heaven in the precincts of light
directly towards the new created world
and man there placd with purpose to assay
if him by force he can destroy or worse
by some false guile pervert and shall pervert
for man will hearken to his glozing lies
and easily transgress the sole command
sole pledge of his obedience so will fall
he and his faithless progeny whose fault
whose but his own ingrate he had of me
all he could have i made him just and right
sufficient to have stood though free to fall
such i created all the ethereal powers
and spirits both them who stood and them who faild
freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
not free what proof could they have given sincere
of true allegiance constant faith or love
where only what they needs must do appeard
not what they would what praise could they receive
what pleasure i from such obedience paid
when will and reason 
useless and vain of freedom both despoild
made passive both had servd necessity
not me they therefore as to right belongd
so were created nor can justly accuse
their maker or their making or their fate
as if predestination overruld
their will disposd by absolute decree
or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
their own revolt not i if i foreknew
foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
which had no less proved certain unforeknown
so without least impulse or shadow of fate
or aught by me immutably foreseen
they trespass authors to themselves in all
both what they judge and what they choose for so
i formd them free and free they must remain
till they enthrall themselves i else must change
their nature and revoke the high decree
unchangeable eternal which ordaind
their freedom they themselves ordaind their fall
the first sort by their own suggestion fell
selftempted selfdepravd man falls deceivd
by the other first man therefore shall find grace
the other none in mercy and justice both
through heaven and earth so shall my glory excel
but mercy first and last shall brightest shine
thus while god spake ambrosial fragrance filld
all heaven and in the blessed spirits elect
sense of new joy ineffable diffusd
beyond compare the son of god was seen
most glorious in him all his father shone
substantially expressd and in his face
divine compassion visibly appeard
love without end and without measure grace
which uttering thus he to his father spake
o father gracious was that word which closd
thy sovran command that man should find grace
for which both heaven and earth shall high extol
thy praises with the innumerable sound
of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne
encompassd shall resound thee ever blest
for should man finally be lost should man
thy creature late so lovd thy youngest son
fall circumvented thus by fraud though joind
with his own folly that be from thee far
that far be from thee father who art judge
of all things made and judgest only right
or shall the adversary thus obtain
his end and frustrate thine shall he fulfill
his malice and thy goodness bring to nought
or proud return though to his heavier doom
yet with revenge accomplishd and to hell
draw after him the whole race of mankind
by him corrupted or wilt thou thyself
abolish thy creation and unmake
for him what for thy glory thou hast made
so should thy goodness and thy greatness both
be questiond and blasphemd without defence
to whom the great creator thus replied
o son in whom my soul hath chief delight
son of my bosom son who art alone
my word my wisdom and effectual might
all hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all
as my eternal purpose hath decreed
man shall not quite be lost but savd who will
yet not of will in him but grace in me
freely vouchsafd once more i will renew
his lapsed powers though forfeit and enthralld
by sin to foul exorbitant desires
upheld by me yet once more he shall stand
on even ground against his mortal foe
by me upheld that he may know how frail
his fallen condition is and to me owe
all his deliverance and to none but me
some i have chosen of peculiar grace
elect above the rest so is my will
the rest shall hear me call and oft be warnd
their sinful state and to appease betimes
the incensed deity while offerd grace
invites for i will clear their senses dark
what may suffice and soften stony hearts
to pray repent and bring obedience due
to prayer repentance and obedience due
though but endeavourd with sincere intent
mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut
and i will place within them as a guide
my umpire conscience whom if they will hear
light after light well usd they shall attain
and to the end persisting safe arrive
this my long sufferance and my day of grace
they who neglect and scorn shall never taste
but hard be hardend blind be blinded more
that they may stumble on and deeper fall
and none but such from mercy i exclude
but yet all is not done man disobeying
disloyal breaks his fealty and sins
against the high supremacy of heaven
affecting godhead and so losing all
to expiate his treason hath nought left
but to destruction sacred and devote
he with his whole posterity must die
die he or justice must unless for him
some other able and as willing pay
the rigid satisfaction death for death
say heavenly powers where shall we find such love
which of you will be mortal to redeem
mans mortal crime and just the unjust to save
dwells in all heaven charity so dear
he askd but all the heavenly quire stood mute
and silence was in heaven on mans behalf
patron or intercessour none appeard
much less that durst upon his own head draw
the deadly forfeiture and ransom set
and now without redemption all mankind
must have been lost adjudgd to death and hell
by doom severe had not the son of god
in whom the fulness dwells of love divine
his dearest mediation thus renewd
father thy word is past man shall find grace
and shall grace not find means that finds her way
the speediest of thy winged messengers
to visit all thy creatures and to all
comes unprevented unimplord unsought
happy for man so coming he her aid
can never seek once dead in sins and lost
atonement for himself or offering meet
indebted and undone hath none to bring
behold me then me for him life for life
i offer on me let thine anger fall
account me man i for his sake will leave
thy bosom and this glory next to thee
freely put off and for him lastly die
well pleased on me let death wreak all his rage
under his gloomy power i shall not long
lie vanquished thou hast given me to possess
life in myself for ever by thee i live
though now to death i yield and am his due
all that of me can die yet that debt paid
thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
his prey nor suffer my unspotted soul
for ever with corruption there to dwell
but i shall rise victorious and subdue
my vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil
death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop
inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed
i through the ample air in triumph high
shall lead hell captive maugre hell and show
the powers of darkness bound thou at the sight
pleased out of heaven shalt look down and smile
while by thee raised i ruin all my foes
death last and with his carcase glut the grave
then with the multitude of my redeemed
shall enter heaven long absent and return
father to see thy face wherein no cloud
of anger shall remain but peace assured
and reconcilement wrath shall be no more
thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire
    his words here ended but his meek aspect
silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
to mortal men above which only shone
filial obedience as a sacrifice
glad to be offered he attends the will
of his great father admiration seized
all heaven what this might mean and whither tend
wondering but soon th almighty thus replied
    o thou in heaven and earth the only peace
found out for mankind under wrath o thou
my sole complacence well thou knowst how dear
to me are all my works nor man the least
though last created that for him i spare
thee from my bosom and right hand to save
by losing thee a while the whole race lost
thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem
their nature also to thy nature join
and be thyself man among men on earth
made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed
by wondrous birth be thou in adams room
the head of all mankind though adams son
as in him perish all men so in thee
as from a second root shall be restored
as many as are restored without thee none
his crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit
imputed shall absolve them who renounce
their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds
and live in thee transplanted and from thee
receive new life so man as is most just
shall satisfy for man be judged and die
and dying rise and rising with him raise
his brethren ransomed with his own dear life
so heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate
giving to death and dying to redeem
so dearly to redeem what hellish hate
so easily destroyed and still destroys
in those who when they may accept not grace
nor shalt thou by descending to assume
mans nature lessen or degrade thine own
because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
equal to god and equally enjoying
godlike fruition quitted all to save
a world from utter loss and hast been found
by merit more than birthright son of god
found worthiest to be so by being good
far more than great or high because in thee
love hath abounded more than glory abounds
therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
with thee thy manhood also to this throne
here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
both god and man son both of god and man
anointed universal king all power
i give thee reign for ever and assume
thy merits under thee as head supreme
thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce
all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
in heaven or earth or under earth in hell
when thou attended gloriously from heaven
shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
the summoning archangels to proclaim
thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds
the living and forthwith the cited dead
of all past ages to the general doom
shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep
then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
bad men and angels they arraigned shall sink
beneath thy sentence hell her numbers full
thenceforth shall be for ever shut mean while
the world shall burn and from her ashes spring
new heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell
and after all their tribulations long
see golden days fruitful of golden deeds
with joy and peace triumphing and fair truth
then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by
for regal scepter then no more shall need
god shall be all in all but all ye gods
adore him who to compass all this dies
adore the son and honour him as me
no sooner had the almighty ceased but all
the multitude of angels with a shout
loud as from numbers without number sweet
as from blest voices uttering joy heaven rung
with jubilee and loud hosannas filled
the eternal regions lowly reverent
towards either throne they bow and to the ground
with solemn adoration down they cast
their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
immortal amarant a flower which once
in paradise fast by the tree of life
began to bloom but soon for mans offence
to heaven removed where first it grew there grows
and flowers aloft shading the fount of life
and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
rolls oer elysian flowers her amber stream
with these that never fade the spirits elect
bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
impurpled with celestial roses smiled
then crowned again their golden harps they took
harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
of charming symphony they introduce
their sacred song and waken raptures high
no voice exempt no voice but well could join
melodious part such concord is in heaven
thee father first they sung omnipotent
immutable immortal infinite
eternal king the author of all being
fountain of light thyself invisible
amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim
approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
thee next they sang of all creation first
begotten son divine similitude
in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
made visible the almighty father shines
whom else no creature can behold on thee
impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
transfused on thee his ample spirit rests
he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein
by thee created and by thee threw down
the aspiring dominations thou that day
thy fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare
nor stop thy flaming chariotwheels that shook
heavens everlasting frame while oer the necks
thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed
back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim
thee only extolled son of thy fathers might
to execute fierce vengeance on his foes
not so on man him through their malice fallen
father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
so strictly but much more to pity incline
no sooner did thy dear and only son
perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man
so strictly but much more to pity inclined
he to appease thy wrath and end the strife
of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
second to thee offered himself to die
for mans offence o unexampled love
love no where to be found less than divine
hail son of god saviour of men thy name
shall be the copious matter of my song
henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
forget nor from thy fathers praise disjoin
thus they in heaven above the starry sphere
their happy hours in joy and hymning spent
mean while upon the firm opacous globe
of this round world whose first convex divides
the luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
from chaos and the inroad of darkness old
satan alighted walks a globe far off
it seemed now seems a boundless continent
dark waste and wild under the frown of night
starless exposed and everthreatening storms
of chaos blustering round inclement sky
save on that side which from the wall of heaven
though distant far some small reflection gains
of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud
here walked the fiend at large in spacious field
as when a vultur on imaus bred
whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds
dislodging from a region scarce of prey
to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
of ganges or hydaspes indian streams
but in his way lights on the barren plains
of sericana where chineses drive
with sails and wind their cany waggons light
so on this windy sea of land the fiend
walked up and down alone bent on his prey
alone for other creature in this place
living or lifeless to be found was none
none yet but store hereafter from the earth
up hither like aereal vapours flew
of all things transitory and vain when sin
with vanity had filled the works of men
both all things vain and all who in vain things
built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
or happiness in this or the other life
all who have their reward on earth the fruits
of painful superstition and blind zeal
nought seeking but the praise of men here find
fit retribution empty as their deeds
all the unaccomplished works of natures hand
abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
till final dissolution wander here
not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
those argent fields more likely habitants
translated saints or middle spirits hold
betwixt the angelical and human kind
hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
first from the ancient world those giants came
with many a vain exploit though then renowned
the builders next of babel on the plain
of sennaar and still with vain design
new babels had they wherewithal would build
others came single he who to be deemed
a god leaped fondly into aetna flames
empedocles and he who to enjoy
platos elysium leaped into the sea
cleombrotus and many more too long
embryos and idiots eremites and friars
white black and gray with all their trumpery
here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven
and they who to be sure of paradise
dying put on the weeds of dominick
or in franciscan think to pass disguised
they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
and that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
the trepidation talked and that first moved
and now saint peter at heavens wicket seems
to wait them with his keys and now at foot
of heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
a violent cross wind from either coast
blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
into the devious air then might ye see
cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
and fluttered into rags then reliques beads
indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
the sport of winds all these upwhirled aloft
fly oer the backside of the world far off
into a limbo large and broad since called
the paradise of fools to few unknown
long after now unpeopled and untrod
all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed
and long he wandered till at last a gleam
of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
his travelled steps far distant he descries
ascending by degrees magnificent
up to the wall of heaven a structure high
at top whereof but far more rich appeared
the work as of a kingly palacegate
with frontispiece of diamond and gold
embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
the portal shone inimitable on earth
by model or by shading pencil drawn
these stairs were such as whereon jacob saw
angels ascending and descending bands
of guardians bright when he from esau fled
to padanaram in the field of luz
dreaming by night under the open sky
and waking cried this is the gate of heaven
each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes
viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
who after came from earth failing arrived
wafted by angels or flew oer the lake
rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
the stairs were then let down whether to dare
the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
his sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
direct against which opened from beneath
just oer the blissful seat of paradise
a passage down to the earth a passage wide
wider by far than that of aftertimes
over mount sion and though that were large
over the promised land to god so dear
by which to visit oft those happy tribes
on high behests his angels to and fro
passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
from paneas the fount of jordans flood
to beersaba where the holy land
borders on egypt and the arabian shore
so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
to darkness such as bound the ocean wave
satan from hence now on the lower stair
that scaled by steps of gold to heavengate
looks down with wonder at the sudden view
of all this world at once as when a scout
through dark and desert ways with peril gone
all night at last by break of cheerful dawn
obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
which to his eye discovers unaware
the goodly prospect of some foreign land
first seen or some renowned metropolis
with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
such wonder seised though after heaven seen
the spirit malign but much more envy seised
at sight of all this world beheld so fair
round he surveys  from eastern point
of libra to the fleecy star that bears
andromeda far off atlantick seas
beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
he views in breadth and without longer pause
down right into the worlds first region throws
his flight precipitant and winds with ease
through the pure marble air his oblique way
amongst innumerable stars that shone
stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
like those hesperian gardens famed of old
fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
he staid not to inquire above them all
the golden sun in splendour likest heaven
allured his eye thither his course he bends
through the calm firmament  where the great luminary
aloof the vulgar constellations thick
that from his lordly eye keep distance due
dispenses light from far they as they move
their starry dance in numbers that compute
days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
turn swift their various motions or are turned
by his magnetick beam that gently warms
the universe and to each inward part
with gentle penetration though unseen
shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
so wonderously was set his station bright
there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps
astronomer in the suns lucent orb
through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
the place he found beyond expression bright
compared with aught on earth metal or stone
not all parts like but all alike informed
with radiant light as glowing iron with fire
if metal part seemed gold part silver clear
if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
in aarons breastplate and a stone besides
imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
that stone or like to that which here below
philosophers in vain so long have sought
in vain though by their powerful art they bind
volatile hermes and call up unbound
in various shapes old proteus from the sea
drained through a limbeck to his native form
what wonder then if fields and regions here
breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
potable gold when with one virtuous touch
the archchemick sun so far from us remote
produces with terrestrial humour mixed
here in the dark so many precious things
of colour glorious and effect so rare
here matter new to gaze the devil met
undazzled far and wide his eye commands
for sight no obstacle found here nor shade
but all sunshine as when his beams at noon
culminate from the equator as they now
shot upward still direct whence no way round
shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
no where so clear sharpened his visual ray
to objects distant far whereby he soon
saw within ken a glorious angel stand
the same whom john saw also in the sun
his back was turned but not his brightness hid
of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
circled his head nor less his locks behind
illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
lay waving round on some great charge employed
he seemed or fixed in cogitation deep
glad was the spirit impure as now in hope
to find who might direct his wandering flight
to paradise the happy seat of man
his journeys end and our beginning woe
but first he casts to change his proper shape
which else might work him danger or delay
and now a stripling cherub he appears
not of the prime yet such as in his face
youth smiled celestial and to every limb
suitable grace diffused so well he feigned
under a coronet his flowing hair
in curls on either cheek played wings he wore
of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold
his habit fit for speed succinct and held
before his decent steps a silver wand
he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright
ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned
admonished by his ear and straight was known
the archangel uriel one of the seven
who in gods presence nearest to his throne
stand ready at command and are his eyes
that run through all the heavens or down to the earth
bear his swift errands over moist and dry
oer sea and land him satan thus accosts
uriel for thou of those seven spirits that stand
in sight of gods high throne gloriously bright
the first art wont his great authentick will
interpreter through highest heaven to bring
where all his sons thy embassy attend
and here art likeliest by supreme decree
like honour to obtain and as his eye
to visit oft this new creation round
unspeakable desire to see and know
all these his wonderous works but chiefly man
his chief delight and favour him for whom
all these his works so wonderous he ordained
hath brought me from the quires of cherubim
alone thus wandering brightest seraph tell
in which of all these shining orbs hath man
his fixed seat or fixed seat hath none
but all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
that i may find him and with secret gaze
or open admiration him behold
on whom the great creator hath bestowed
worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured
that both in him and all things as is meet
the universal maker we may praise
who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
to deepest hell and to repair that loss
created this new happy race of men
to serve him better wise are all his ways
so spake the false dissembler unperceived
for neither man nor angel can discern
hypocrisy the only evil that walks
invisible except to god alone
by his permissive will through heaven and earth
and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
at wisdoms gate and to simplicity
resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
where no ill seems which now for once beguiled
uriel though regent of the sun and held
the sharpestsighted spirit of all in heaven
who to the fraudulent impostor foul
in his uprightness answer thus returned
fair angel thy desire which tends to know
the works of god thereby to glorify
the great workmaster leads to no excess
that reaches blame but rather merits praise
the more it seems excess that led thee hither
from thy empyreal mansion thus alone
to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
contented with report hear only in heaven
for wonderful indeed are all his works
pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
had in remembrance always with delight
but what created mind can comprehend
their number or the wisdom infinite
that brought them forth but hid their causes deep
i saw when at his word the formless mass
this worlds material mould came to a heap
confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined
till at his second bidding darkness fled
light shone and order from disorder sprung
swift to their several quarters hasted then
the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire
and this ethereal quintessence of heaven
flew upward spirited with various forms
that rolled orbicular and turned to stars
numberless as thou seest and how they move
each had his place appointed each his course
the rest in circuit walls this universe
look downward on that globe whose hither side
with light from hence though but reflected shines
that place is earth the seat of man that light
his day which else as the other hemisphere
night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
 her aid
timely interposes and her monthly round
still ending still renewing through mid heaven
with borrowed light her countenance triform
hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth
and in her pale dominion checks the night
that spot to which i point is paradise
adams abode those lofty shades his bower
thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires
thus said he turned and satan bowing low
as to superiour spirits is wont in heaven
where honour due and reverence none neglects
took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath
down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success
throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel
nor staid till on niphates top he lights







o for that warning voice which he who saw
the apocalypse heard cry in heaven aloud
then when the dragon put to second rout
came furious down to be revenged on men
woe to the inhabitants on earth that now
while time was our first parents had been warned
the coming of their secret foe and scaped
haply so scaped his mortal snare for now
satan now first inflamed with rage came down
the tempter ere the accuser of mankind
to wreak on innocent frail man his loss
of that first battle and his flight to hell
yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
far off and fearless nor with cause to boast
begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast
and like a devilish engine back recoils
upon himself horrour and doubt distract
his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
the hell within him for within him hell
he brings and round about him nor from hell
one step no more than from himself can fly
by change of place now conscience wakes despair
that slumbered wakes the bitter memory
of what he was what is and what must be
worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue
sometimes towards eden which now in his view
lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad
sometimes towards heaven and the fullblazing sun
which now sat high in his meridian tower
then much revolving thus in sighs began
o thou that with surpassing glory crowned
lookest from thy sole dominion like the god
of this new world at whose sight all the stars
hide their diminished heads to thee i call
but with no friendly voice and add thy name
of sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams
that bring to my remembrance from what state
i fell how glorious once above thy sphere
till pride and worse ambition threw me down
warring in heaven against heavens matchless king
ah wherefore he deserved no such return
from me whom he created what i was
in that bright eminence and with his good
upbraided none nor was his service hard
what could be less than to afford him praise
the easiest recompence and pay him thanks
how due yet all his good proved ill in me
and wrought but malice lifted up so high
i sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
would set me highest and in a moment quit
the debt immense of endless gratitude
so burdensome still paying still to owe
forgetful what from him i still received
and understood not that a grateful mind
by owing owes not but still pays at once
indebted and discharged what burden then
o had his powerful destiny ordained
me some inferiour angel i had stood
then happy no unbounded hope had raised
ambition yet why not some other power
as great might have aspired and me though mean
drawn to his part but other powers as great
fell not but stand unshaken from within
or from without to all temptations armed
hadst thou the same free will and power to stand
thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse
but heavens free love dealt equally to all
be then his love accursed since love or hate
to me alike it deals eternal woe
nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
chose freely what it now so justly rues
me miserable which way shall i fly
infinite wrath and infinite despair
which way i fly is hell myself am hell
and in the lowest deep a lower deep
still threatening to devour me opens wide
to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven
o then at last relent is there no place
left for repentance none for pardon left
none left but by submission and that word
disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
among the spirits beneath whom i seduced
with other promises and other vaunts
than to submit boasting i could subdue
the omnipotent ay me they little know
how dearly i abide that boast so vain
under what torments inwardly i groan
while they adore me on the throne of hell
with diadem and scepter high advanced
the lower still i fall only supreme
in misery such joy ambition finds
but say i could repent and could obtain
by act of grace my former state how soon
would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
what feigned submission swore ease would recant
vows made in pain as violent and void
for never can true reconcilement grow
where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
which would but lead me to a worse relapse
and heavier fall so should i purchase dear
short intermission bought with double smart
this knows my punisher therefore as far
from granting he as i from begging peace
all hope excluded thus behold instead
of us outcast exild his new delight
mankind created and for him this world
so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear
farewell remorse all good to me is lost
evil be thou my good by thee at least
divided empire with heavens king i hold
by thee and more than half perhaps will reign
as man ere long and this new world shall know
thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair
which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
him counterfeit if any eye beheld
for heavenly minds from such distempers foul
are ever clear whereof he soon aware
each perturbation smoothed with outward calm
artificer of fraud and was the first
that practised falsehood under saintly show
deep malice to conceal couched with revenge
yet not enough had practised to deceive
uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
the way he went and on the assyrian mount
saw him disfigured more than could befall
spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
he marked and mad demeanour then alone
as he supposed all unobserved unseen
so on he fares and to the border comes
of eden where delicious paradise
now nearer crowns with her enclosure green
as with a rural mound the champaign head
of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
with thicket overgrown grotesque and wild
access denied and overhead upgrew
insuperable height of loftiest shade
cedar and pine and fir and branching palm
a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend
shade above shade a woody theatre
of stateliest view yet higher than their tops
the verdurous wall of paradise upsprung
which to our general sire gave prospect large
into his nether empire neighbouring round
and higher than that wall a circling row
of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit
blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed
on which the sun more glad impressed his beams
than in fair evening cloud or humid bow
when god hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
that landskip and of pure now purer air
meets his approach and to the heart inspires
vernal delight and joy able to drive
all sadness but despair now gentle gales
fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
those balmy spoils as when to them who fail
beyond the cape of hope and now are past
mozambick off at sea northeast winds blow
sabean odours from the spicy shore
of araby the blest with such delay
well pleased they slack their course and many a league
cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles
so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend
who came their bane though with them better pleased
than asmodeus with the fishy fume
that drove him though enamoured from the spouse
of tobits son and with a vengeance sent
from media post to egypt there fast bound
now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
satan had journeyed on pensive and slow
but further way found none so thick entwined
as one continued brake the undergrowth
of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
all path of man or beast that passed that way
one gate there only was and that looked east
on the other side which when the archfelon saw
due entrance he disdained and in contempt
at one flight bound high overleaped all bound
of hill or highest wall and sheer within
lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf
whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey
watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
in hurdled cotes amid the field secure
leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold
or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
in at the window climbs or oer the tiles
so clomb this first grand thief into gods fold
so since into his church lewd hirelings climb
thence up he flew and on the tree of life
the middle tree and highest there that grew
sat like a cormorant yet not true life
thereby regained but sat devising death
to them who lived nor on the virtue thought
of that lifegiving plant but only used
for prospect what well used had been the pledge
of immortality so little knows
any but god alone to value right
the good before him but perverts best things
to worst abuse or to their meanest use
beneath him with new wonder now he views
to all delight of human sense exposed
in narrow room natures whole wealth yea more
a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
of god the garden was by him in the east
of eden planted eden stretched her line
from auran eastward to the royal towers
of great seleucia built by grecian kings
or where the sons of eden long before
dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soil
his far more pleasant garden god ordained
out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste
and all amid them stood the tree of life
high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
of vegetable gold and next to life
our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by
knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill
southward through eden went a river large
nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
passed underneath ingulfed for god had thrown
that mountain as his gardenmould high raised
upon the rapid current which through veins
of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn
rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
watered the garden thence united fell
down the steep glade and met the nether flood
which from his darksome passage now appears
and now divided into four main streams
runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
and country whereof here needs no account
but rather to tell how if art could tell
how from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
with mazy errour under pendant shades
ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art
in beds and curious knots but nature boon
poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
both where the morning sun first warmly smote
the open field and where the unpierced shade
imbrowned the noontide bowers thus was this place
a happy rural seat of various view
groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
hung amiable hesperian fables true
if true here only and of delicious taste
betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
grazing the tender herb were interposed
or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
of some irriguous valley spread her store
flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
another side umbrageous grots and caves
of cool recess oer which the mantling vine
lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
that to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams
the birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
breathing the smell of field and grove attune
the trembling leaves while universal pan
knit with the graces and the hours in dance
led on the eternal spring not that fair field
of enna where proserpine gathering flowers
herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis
was gathered which cost ceres all that pain
to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
of daphne by orontes and the inspired
castalian spring might with this paradise
of eden strive nor that nyseian isle
girt with the river triton where old cham
whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove
hid amalthea and her florid son
young bacchus from his stepdame rheas eye
nor where abassin kings their issue guard
mount amara though this by some supposed
true paradise under the ethiop line
by nilus head enclosed with shining rock
a whole days journey high but wide remote
from this assyrian garden where the fiend
saw undelighted all delight all kind
of living creatures new to sight and strange
two of far nobler shape erect and tall
godlike erect with native honour clad
in naked majesty seemed lords of all
and worthy seemed for in their looks divine
the image of their glorious maker shone
truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure

whence true authority in men though both
not equal as their sex not equal seemed
for contemplation he and valour formed
for softness she and sweet attractive grace
he for god only she for god in him
his fair large front and eye sublime declared
absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
round from his parted forelock manly hung
clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad
she as a veil down to the slender waist
her unadorned golden tresses wore
dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved
as the vine curls her tendrils which implied
subjection but required with gentle sway
and by her yielded by him best received
yielded with coy submission modest pride
and sweet reluctant amorous delay
nor those mysterious parts were then concealed
then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
of natures works honour dishonourable
sinbred how have ye troubled all mankind
with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure
and banished from mans life his happiest life
simplicity and spotless innocence
so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
of god or angel for they thought no ill
so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair
that ever since in loves embraces met
adam the goodliest man of men since born
his sons the fairest of her daughters eve
under a tuft of shade that on a green
stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
they sat them down and after no more toil
of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
to recommend cool zephyr and made ease
more easy wholesome thirst and appetite
more grateful to their supperfruits they fell
nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
yielded them sidelong as they sat recline
on the soft downy bank damasked with flowers
the savoury pulp they chew and in the rind
still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream
nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
fair couple linked in happy nuptial league
alone as they about them frisking played
all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
in wood or wilderness forest or den
sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards
gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant
to make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
his lithe proboscis close the serpent sly
insinuating wove with gordian twine
his braided train and of his fatal guile
gave proof unheeded others on the grass
couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat
or bedward ruminating for the sun
declined was hasting now with prone career
to the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
of heaven the stars that usher evening rose
when satan still in gaze as first he stood
scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad
o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold
into our room of bliss thus high advanced
creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps
not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright
little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
with wonder and could love so lively shines
in them divine resemblance and such grace
the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured
ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
your change approaches when all these delights
will vanish and deliver ye to woe
more woe the more your taste is now of joy
happy but for so happy ill secured
long to continue and this high seat your heaven
ill fenced for heaven to keep out such a foe
as now is entered yet no purposed foe
to you whom i could pity thus forlorn
though i unpitied league with you i seek
and mutual amity so strait so close
that i with you must dwell or you with me
henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
like this fair paradise your sense yet such
accept your makers work he gave it me
which i as freely give hell shall unfold
to entertain you two her widest gates
and send forth all her kings there will be room
not like these narrow limits to receive
your numerous offspring if no better place
thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
on you who wrong me not for him who wronged
and should i at your harmless innocence
melt as i do yet publick reason just
honour and empire with revenge enlarged
by conquering this new world compels me now
to do what else though damned i should abhor
so spake the fiend and with necessity
the tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds
then from his lofty stand on that high tree
down he alights among the sportful herd
of those fourfooted kinds himself now one
now other as their shape served best his end
nearer to view his prey and unespied
to mark what of their state he more might learn
by word or action marked about them round
a lion now he stalks with fiery glare
then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play
straight couches close then rising changes oft
his couchant watch as one who chose his ground
whence rushing he might surest seize them both
griped in each paw when adam first of men
to first of women eve thus moving speech
turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow
sole partner and sole part of all these joys
dearer thyself than all needs must the power
that made us and for us this ample world
be infinitely good and of his good
as liberal and free as infinite
that raised us from the dust and placed us here
in all this happiness who at his hand
have nothing merited nor can perform
aught whereof he hath need he who requires
from us no other service than to keep
this one this easy charge of all the trees
in paradise that bear delicious fruit
so various not to taste that only tree
of knowledge planted by the tree of life
so near grows death to life whateer death is
some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree
the only sign of our obedience left
among so many signs of power and rule
conferred upon us and dominion given
over all other creatures that possess
earth air and sea then let us not think hard
one easy prohibition who enjoy
free leave so large to all things else and choice
unlimited of manifold delights
but let us ever praise him and extol
his bounty following our delightful task
to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers
which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet
to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom
and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh
and without whom am to no end my guide
and head what thou hast said is just and right
for we to him indeed all praises owe
and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
so far the happier lot enjoying thee
preeminent by so much odds while thou
like consort to thyself canst no where find
that day i oft remember when from sleep
i first awaked and found myself reposed
under a shade on flowers much wondering where
and what i was whence thither brought and how
not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
of waters issued from a cave and spread
into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went
with unexperienced thought and laid me down
on the green bank to look into the clear
smooth lake that to me seemed another sky
as i bent down to look just opposite
a shape within the watery gleam appeared
bending to look on me i started back
it started back but pleased i soon returned
pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
of sympathy and love there i had fixed
mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire
had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest
what there thou seest fair creature is thyself
with thee it came and goes but follow me
and i will bring thee where no shadow stays
thy coming and thy soft embraces he
whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
inseparably thine to him shalt bear
multitudes like thyself and thence be called
mother of human race what could i do
but follow straight invisibly thus led
till i espied thee fair indeed and tall
under a platane yet methought less fair
less winning soft less amiably mild
than that smooth watery image back i turned
thou following cryedst aloud return fair eve
whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art
his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent
out of my side to thee nearest my heart
substantial life to have thee by my side
henceforth an individual solace dear
part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
my other half with that thy gentle hand
seised mine i yielded and from that time see
how beauty is excelled by manly grace
and wisdom which alone is truly fair
so spake our general mother and with eyes
of conjugal attraction unreproved
and meek surrender halfembracing leaned
on our first father half her swelling breast
naked met his under the flowing gold
of her loose tresses hid he in delight
both of her beauty and submissive charms
smiled with superiour love as jupiter
on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
that shed mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
with kisses pure aside the devil turned
for envy yet with jealous leer malign
eyed them askance and to himself thus plained
sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
imparadised in one anothers arms
the happier eden shall enjoy their fill
of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust
where neither joy nor love but fierce desire
among our other torments not the least
still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines
yet let me not forget what i have gained
from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems
one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called
forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden
suspicious reasonless why should their lord
envy them that can it be sin to know
can it be death and do they only stand
by ignorance is that their happy state
the proof of their obedience and their faith
o fair foundation laid whereon to build
their ruin hence i will excite their minds
with more desire to know and to reject
envious commands invented with design
to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
equal with gods aspiring to be such
they taste and die what likelier can ensue
but first with narrow search i must walk round
this garden and no corner leave unspied
a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side
or in thick shade retired from him to draw
what further would be learned live while ye may
yet happy pair enjoy till i return
short pleasures for long woes are to succeed
so saying his proud step he scornful turned
but with sly circumspection and began
through wood through waste oer hill oer dale his roam
mean while in utmost longitude where heaven
with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
slowly descended and with right aspect
against the eastern gate of paradise
levelled his evening rays it was a rock
of alabaster piled up to the clouds
conspicuous far winding with one ascent
accessible from earth one entrance high
the rest was craggy cliff that overhung
still as it rose impossible to climb
betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat
chief of the angelick guards awaiting night
about him exercised heroick games
the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand
celestial armoury shields helms and spears
hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
thither came uriel gliding through the even
on a sunbeam swift as a shooting star
in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
impress the air and shows the mariner
from what point of his compass to beware
impetuous winds he thus began in haste
gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
charge and strict watch that to this happy place
no evil thing approach or enter in
this day at highth of noon came to my sphere
a spirit zealous as he seemed to know
more of the almightys works and chiefly man
gods latest image i described his way
bent all on speed and marked his aery gait
but in the mount that lies from eden north
where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
alien from heaven with passions foul obscured
mine eye pursued him still but under shade
lost sight of him one of the banished crew
i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
new troubles him thy care must be to find
to whom the winged warriour thus returned
uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst
see far and wide in at this gate none pass
the vigilance here placed but such as come
well known from heaven and since meridian hour
no creature thence if spirit of other sort
so minded have oerleaped these earthly bounds
on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
spiritual substance with corporeal bar
but if within the circuit of these walks
in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know
so promised he and uriel to his charge
returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
beneath the azores whether the prime orb
incredible how swift had thither rolled
diurnal or this less volubil earth
by shorter flight to the east had left him there
arraying with reflected purple and gold
the clouds that on his western throne attend
now came still evening on and twilight gray
had in her sober livery all things clad
silence accompanied for beast and bird
they to their grassy couch these to their nests
were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
she all night long her amorous descant sung
silence was pleased now glowed the firmament
with living sapphires hesperus that led
the starry host rode brightest till the moon
rising in clouded majesty at length
apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
and oer the dark her silver mantle threw
when adam thus to eve fair consort the hour
of night and all things now retired to rest
mind us of like repose since god hath set
labour and rest as day and night to men
successive and the timely dew of sleep
now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
our eyelids other creatures all day long
rove idle unemployed and less need rest
man hath his daily work of body or mind
appointed which declares his dignity
and the regard of heaven on all his ways
while other animals unactive range
and of their doings god takes no account
tomorrow ere fresh morning streak the east
with first approach of light we must be risen
and at our pleasant labour to reform
yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green
our walk at noon with branches overgrown
that mock our scant manuring and require
more hands than ours to lop their wanton growth
those blossoms also and those dropping gums
that lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth
ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease
mean while as nature wills night bids us rest
to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorned
my author and disposer what thou bidst
unargued i obey so god ordains
god is thy law thou mine to know no more
is womans happiest knowledge and her praise
with thee conversing i forget all time
all seasons and their change all please alike
sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet
with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun
when first on this delightful land he spreads
his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower
glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
after soft showers and sweet the coming on
of grateful evening mild then silent night
with this her solemn bird and this fair moon
and these the gems of heaven her starry train
but neither breath of morn when she ascends
with charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
on this delightful land nor herb fruit flower
glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers
nor grateful evening mild nor silent night
with this her solemn bird nor walk by moon
or glittering starlight without thee is sweet
but wherefore all night long shine these for whom
this glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes
to whom our general ancestor replied
daughter of god and man accomplished eve
these have their course to finish round the earth
by morrow evening and from land to land
in order though to nations yet unborn
ministring light prepared they set and rise
lest total darkness should by night regain
her old possession and extinguish life
in nature and all things which these soft fires
not only enlighten but with kindly heat
of various influence foment and warm
temper or nourish or in part shed down
their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
on earth made hereby apter to receive
perfection from the suns more potent ray
these then though unbeheld in deep of night
shine not in vain nor think though men were none
that heaven would want spectators god want praise
millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
all these with ceaseless praise his works behold
both day and night how often from the steep
of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
celestial voices to the midnight air
sole or responsive each to others note
singing their great creator oft in bands
while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
in full harmonick number joined their songs
divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven
thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
on to their blissful bower it was a place
chosen by the sovran planter when he framed
all things to mans delightful use the roof
of thickest covert was inwoven shade
laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub
fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower
iris all hues roses and jessamin
reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
mosaick underfoot the violet
crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
of costliest emblem other creature here
bird beast insect or worm durst enter none
such was their awe of man in shadier bower
more sacred and sequestered though but feigned
pan or sylvanus never slept nor nymph
nor faunus haunted here in close recess
with flowers garlands and sweetsmelling herbs
espoused eve decked first her nuptial bed
and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung
what day the genial angel to our sire
brought her in naked beauty more adorned
more lovely than pandora whom the gods
endowed with all their gifts and o too like
in sad event when to the unwiser son
of japhet brought by hermes she ensnared
mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
on him who had stole joves authentick fire
thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood
both turned and under open sky adored
the god that made both sky air earth and heaven
which they beheld the moons resplendent globe
and starry pole thou also madest the night
maker omnipotent and thou the day
which we in our appointed work employed
have finished happy in our mutual help
and mutual love the crown of all our bliss
ordained by thee and this delicious place
for us too large where thy abundance wants
partakers and uncropt falls to the ground
but thou hast promised from us two a race
to fill the earth who shall with us extol
thy goodness infinite both when we wake
and when we seek as now thy gift of sleep
this said unanimous and other rites
observing none but adoration pure
which god likes best into their inmost bower
handed they went and eased the putting off
these troublesome disguises which we wear
straight side by side were laid nor turned i ween
adam from his fair spouse nor eve the rites
mysterious of connubial love refused
whatever hypocrites austerely talk
of purity and place and innocence
defaming as impure what god declares
pure and commands to some leaves free to all
our maker bids encrease who bids abstain
but our destroyer foe to god and man
hail wedded love mysterious law true source
of human offspring sole propriety
in paradise of all things common else
by thee adulterous lust was driven from men
among the bestial herds to range by thee
founded in reason loyal just and pure
relations dear and all the charities
of father son and brother first were known
far be it that i should write thee sin or blame
or think thee unbefitting holiest place
perpetual fountain of domestick sweets
whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced
present or past as saints and patriarchs used
here love his golden shafts employs here lights
his constant lamp and waves his purple wings
reigns here and revels not in the bought smile
of harlots loveless joyless unendeared
casual fruition nor in courtamours
mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball
or serenate which the starved lover sings
to his proud fair best quitted with disdain
these lulled by nightingales embracing slept
and on their naked limbs the flowery roof
showered roses which the morn repaired sleep on
blest pair and o yet happiest if ye seek
no happier state and know to know no more
now had night measured with her shadowy cone
half way up hill this vast sublunar vault
and from their ivory port the cherubim
forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
to their night watches in warlike parade
when gabriel to his next in power thus spake
uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
with strictest watch these other wheel the north
our circuit meets full west as flame they part
half wheeling to the shield half to the spear
from these two strong and subtle spirits he called
that near him stood and gave them thus in charge
ithuriel and zephon with winged speed
search through this garden leave unsearched no nook
but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge
now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm
this evening from the suns decline arrived
who tells of some infernal spirit seen
hitherward bent  escaped
the bars of hell on errand bad no doubt
such where ye find seise fast and hither bring
so saying on he led his radiant files
dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
in search of whom they sought him there they found
squat like a toad close at the ear of eve
assaying by his devilish art to reach
the organs of her fancy and with them forge
illusions as he list phantasms and dreams
or if inspiring venom he might taint
the animal spirits that from pure blood arise
like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
at least distempered discontented thoughts
vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires
blown up with high conceits ingendering pride
him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
touched lightly for no falshood can endure
touch of celestial temper but returns
of force to its own likeness up he starts
discovered and surprised as when a spark
lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
fit for the tun some magazine to store
against a rumoured war the smutty grain
with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air
so started up in his own shape the fiend
back stept those two fair angels half amazed
so sudden to behold the grisly king
yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon
which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell
comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed
why satst thou like an enemy in wait
here watching at the head of these that sleep
know ye not then said satan filled with scorn
know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
for you there sitting where ye durst not soar
not to know me argues yourselves unknown
the lowest of your throng or if ye know
why ask ye and superfluous begin
your message like to end as much in vain
to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn
think not revolted spirit thy shape the same
or undiminished brightness to be known
as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure
that glory then when thou no more wast good
departed from thee and thou resemblest now
thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul
but come for thou be sure shalt give account
to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
this place inviolable and these from harm
so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke
severe in youthful beauty added grace
invincible abashed the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is and saw
virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
his loss but chiefly to find here observed
his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
undaunted if i must contend said he
best with the best the sender not the sent
or all at once more glory will be won
or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold
will save us trial what the least can do
single against thee wicked and thence weak
the fiend replied not overcome with rage
but like a proud steed reined went haughty on
champing his iron curb to strive or fly
he held it vain awe from above had quelled
his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh
the western point where those halfrounding guards
just met and closing stood in squadron joined
a waiting next command to whom their chief
gabriel from the front thus called aloud
o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
ithuriel and zephon through the shade
and with them comes a third of regal port
but faded splendour wan who by his gait
and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell
not likely to part hence without contest
stand firm for in his look defiance lours
he scarce had ended when those two approached
and brief related whom they brought where found
how busied in what form and posture couched
to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake
why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed
to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
of others who approve not to transgress
by thy example but have power and right
to question thy bold entrance on this place
employed it seems to violate sleep and those
whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss
to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow
gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise
and such i held thee but this question asked
puts me in doubt lives there who loves his pain
who would not finding way break loose from hell
though thither doomed thou wouldst thyself no doubt
and boldly venture to whatever place
farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
torment with ease and soonest recompense
dole with delight which in this place i sought
to thee no reason who knowest only good
but evil hast not tried and wilt object
his will who bounds us let him surer bar
his iron gates if he intends our stay
in that dark durance thus much what was asked
the rest is true they found me where they say
but that implies not violence or harm
thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved
disdainfully half smiling thus replied
o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise
since satan fell whom folly overthrew
and now returns him from his prison scaped
gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed
so wise he judges it to fly from pain
however and to scape his punishment
so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell
which taught thee yet no better that no pain
can equal anger infinite provoked
but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
came not all hell broke loose or thou than they
less hardy to endure courageous chief
the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
to thy deserted host this cause of flight
thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern
not that i less endure or shrink from pain
insulting angel well thou knowest i stood
thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
the blasting vollied thunder made all speed
and seconded thy else not dreaded spear
but still thy words at random as before
argue thy inexperience what behoves
from hard assays and ill successes past
a faithful leader not to hazard all
through ways of danger by himself untried
i therefore i alone first undertook
to wing the desolate abyss and spy
this new created world whereof in hell
fame is not silent here in hope to find
better abode and my afflicted powers
to settle here on earth or in mid air
though for possession put to try once more
what thou and thy gay legions dare against
whose easier business were to serve their lord
high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne
and practised distances to cringe not fight
to whom the warriour angel soon replied
to say and straight unsay pretending first
wise to fly pain professing next the spy
argues no leader but a liar traced
satan and couldst thou faithful add o name
o sacred name of faithfulness profaned
faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew
army of fiends fit body to fit head
was this your discipline and faith engaged
your military obedience to dissolve
allegiance to the acknowledged power supreme
and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
patron of liberty who more than thou
once fawned and cringed and servilely adored
heavens awful monarch wherefore but in hope
to dispossess him and thyself to reign
but mark what i arreed thee now avant
fly neither whence thou fledst if from this hour
within these hallowed limits thou appear
back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained
and seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
the facile gates of hell too slightly barred
so threatened he but satan to no threats
gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
then when i am thy captive talk of chains
proud limitary cherub but ere then
far heavier load thyself expect to feel
from my prevailing arm though heavens king
ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
usd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
in progress through the road of heaven starpaved
while thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
their phalanx and began to hem him round
with ported spears as thick as when a field
of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed
collecting all his might dilated stood
like teneriff or atlas unremoved
his stature reached the sky and on his crest
sat horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
might have ensued nor only paradise
in this commotion but the starry cope
of heaven perhaps or all the elements
at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
with violence of this conflict had not soon
the eternal to prevent such horrid fray
hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen
betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign
wherein all things created first he weighed
the pendulous round earth with balanced air
in counterpoise now ponders all events
battles and realms in these he put two weights
the sequel each of parting and of fight
the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam
which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend
satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine
neither our own but given what folly then
to boast what arms can do since thine no more
than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
to trample thee as mire for proof look up
and read thy lot in yon celestial sign
where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak
if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew
his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
murmuring and with him fled the shades of night







now morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl
when adam waked so customed for his sleep
was aerylight from pure digestion bred
and temperate vapours bland which the only sound
of leaves and fuming rills auroras fan
lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
of birds on every bough so much the more
his wonder was to find unwakened eve
with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek
as through unquiet rest he on his side
leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
hung over her enamoured and beheld
beauty which whether waking or asleep
shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes
her hand soft touching whispered thus awake
my fairest my espoused my latest found
heavens last best gift my ever new delight
awake the morning shines and the fresh field
calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
our tender plants how blows the citron grove
what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed
how nature paints her colours how the bee
sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet
such whispering waked her but with startled eye
on adam whom embracing thus she spake
o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose
my glory my perfection glad i see
thy face and morn returned for i this night
 have dreamed
if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee
works of day past or morrows next design
but of offence and trouble which my mind
knew never till this irksome night methought
close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
with gentle voice i thought it thine it said
why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time
the cool the silent save where silence yields
to the nightwarbling bird that now awake
tunes sweetest his lovelaboured song now reigns
fullorbed the moon and with more pleasing light
shadowy sets off the face of things in vain
if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes
whom to behold but thee natures desire
in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
attracted by thy beauty still to gaze
i rose as at thy call but found thee not
to find thee i directed then my walk
and on methought alone i passed through ways
that brought me on a sudden to the tree
of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed
much fairer to my fancy than by day
and as i wondering looked beside it stood
one shaped and winged like one of those from heaven
by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled
ambrosia on that tree he also gazed
and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharged
deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet
nor god nor man is knowledge so despised
or envy or what reserve forbids to taste
forbid who will none shall from me withhold
longer thy offered good why else set here
this said he paused not but with venturous arm
he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled
at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold
but he thus overjoyed o fruit divine
sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt
forbidden here it seems as only fit
for gods yet able to make gods of men
and why not gods of men since good the more
communicated more abundant grows
the author not impaired but honoured more
here happy creature fair angelick eve
partake thou also happy though thou art
happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be
taste this and be henceforth among the gods
thyself a goddess not to earth confined
but sometimes in the air as we sometimes
ascend to heaven by merit thine and see
what life the gods live there and such live thou
so saying he drew nigh and to me held
even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell
so quickened appetite that i methought
could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
with him i flew and underneath beheld
the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide
and various wondering at my flight and change
to this high exaltation suddenly
my guide was gone and i methought sunk down
and fell asleep but o how glad i waked
to find this but a dream thus eve her night
related and thus adam answered sad
best image of myself and dearer half
the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
affects me equally nor can i like
this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear
yet evil whence in thee can harbour none
created pure but know that in the soul
are many lesser faculties that serve
reason as chief among these fancy next
her office holds of all external things
which the five watchful senses represent
she forms imaginations aery shapes
which reason joining or disjoining frames
all what we affirm or what deny and call
our knowledge or opinion then retires
into her private cell when nature rests
oft in her absence mimick fancy wakes
to imitate her but misjoining shapes
wild work produces oft and most in dreams
ill matching words and deeds long past or late
some such resemblances methinks i find
of our last evenings talk in this thy dream
but with addition strange yet be not sad
evil into the mind of god or man
may come and go so unreproved and leave
no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
waking thou never will consent to do
be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks
that wont to be more cheerful and serene
than when fair morning first smiles on the world
and let us to our fresh employments rise
among the groves the fountains and the flowers
that open now their choisest bosomed smells
reserved from night and kept for thee in store
so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered
but silently a gentle tear let fall
from either eye and wiped them with her hair
two other precious drops that ready stood
each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
and pious awe that feared to have offended
so all was cleared and to the field they haste
but first from under shady arborous roof
soon as they forth were come to open sight
of dayspring and the sun who scarce uprisen
with wheels yet hovering oer the oceanbrim
shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray
discovering in wide landskip all the east
of paradise and edens happy plains
lowly they bowed adoring and began
their orisons each morning duly paid
in various style for neither various style
nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
unmeditated such prompt eloquence
flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse
more tuneable than needed lute or harp
to add more sweetness and they thus began
these are thy glorious works parent of good
almighty thine this universal frame
thus wonderous fair thyself how wonderous then
unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
to us invisible or dimly seen
in these thy lowest works yet these declare
thy goodness beyond thought and power divine
speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light
angels for ye behold him and with songs
and choral symphonies day without night
circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven
on earth join all ye creatures to extol
him first him last him midst and without end
fairest of stars last in the train of night
if better thou belong not to the dawn
sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere
while day arises that sweet hour of prime
thou sun of this great world both eye and soul
acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
in thy eternal course both when thou climbest
and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest
moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest
with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies
and ye five other wandering fires that move
in mystick dance not without song resound
his praise who out of darkness called up light
air and ye elements the eldest birth
of natures womb that in quaternion run
perpetual circle multiform and mix
and nourish all things let your ceaseless change
vary to our great maker still new praise
ye mists and exhalations that now rise
from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray
till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold
in honour to the worlds great author rise
whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky
or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers
rising or falling still advance his praise
his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow
breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines
with every plant in sign of worship wave
fountains and ye that warble as ye flow
melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise
join voices all ye living souls ye birds
that singing up to heavengate ascend
bear on your wings and in your notes his praise
ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
the earth and stately tread or lowly creep
witness if i be silent morn or even
to hill or valley fountain or fresh shade
made vocal by my song and taught his praise
hail universal lord be bounteous still
to give us only good and if the night
have gathered aught of evil or concealed
disperse it as now light dispels the dark
so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm
on to their mornings rural work they haste
among sweet dews and flowers where any row
of fruittrees overwoody reached too far
their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
fruitless embraces or they led the vine
to wed her elm she spoused about him twines
her marriageable arms and with him brings
her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
his barren leaves them thus employed beheld
with pity heavens high king and to him called
raphael the sociable spirit that deigned
to travel with tobias and secured
his marriage with the seventimeswedded maid
raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth
satan from hell scaped through the darksome gulf
hath raised in paradise and how disturbed
this night the human pair how he designs
in them at once to ruin all mankind
go therefore half this day as friend with friend
converse with adam in what bower or shade
thou findest him from the heat of noon retired
to respite his daylabour with repast
or with repose and such discourse bring on
as may advise him of his happy state
happiness in his power left free to will
left to his own free will his will though free
yet mutable whence warn him to beware
he swerve not too secure tell him withal
his danger and from whom what enemy
late fallen himself from heaven is plotting now
the fall of others from like state of bliss
by violence no for that shall be withstood
but by deceit and lies this let him know
lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
surprisal unadmonished unforewarned
so spake the eternal father and fulfilled
all justice nor delayed the winged saint
after his charge received but from among
thousand celestial ardours where he stood
veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light
flew through the midst of heaven the angelick quires
on each hand parting to his speed gave way
through all the empyreal road till at the gate
of heaven arrived the gate selfopened wide
on golden hinges turning as by work
divine the sovran architect had framed
from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight
star interposed however small he sees
not unconformed to other shining globes
earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned
above all hills as when by night the glass
of galileo less assured observes
imagined lands and regions in the moon
or pilot from amidst the cyclades
delos or samos first appearing kens
a cloudy spot down thither prone in flight
he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
now on the polar winds then with quick fan
winnows the buxom air till within soar
of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird
when to enshrine his reliques in the suns
bright temple to egyptian thebes he flies
at once on the eastern cliff of paradise
he lights and to his proper shape returns
a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade
his lineaments divine the pair that clad
each shoulder broad came mantling oer his breast
with regal ornament the middle pair
girt like a starry zone his waist and round
skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
and colours dipt in heaven the third his feet
shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
skytinctured grain like maias son he stood
and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
the circuit wide straight knew him all the bands
of angels under watch and to his state
and to his message high in honour rise
for on some message high they guessed him bound
their glittering tents he passed and now is come
into the blissful field through groves of myrrh
and flowering odours cassia nard and balm
a wilderness of sweets for nature here
wantoned as in her prime and played at will
her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet
wild above rule or art enormous bliss
him through the spicy forest onward come
adam discerned as in the door he sat
of his cool bower while now the mounted sun
shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
earths inmost womb more warmth than adam needs
and eve within due at her hour prepared
for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please
true appetite and not disrelish thirst
of nectarous draughts between from milky stream
berry or grape to whom thus adam called
haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold
eastward among those trees what glorious shape
comes this way moving seems another morn
risen on midnoon some great behest from heaven
to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe
this day to be our guest but go with speed
and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour
abundance fit to honour and receive
our heavenly stranger well we may afford
our givers their own gifts and large bestow
from large bestowed where nature multiplies
her fertile growth and by disburthening grows
more fruitful which instructs us not to spare
to whom thus eve adam earths hallowed mould
of god inspired small store will serve where store
all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk
save what by frugal storing firmness gains
to nourish and superfluous moist consumes
but i will haste and from each bough and brake
each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice
to entertain our angelguest as he
beholding shall confess that here on earth
god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven
so saying with dispatchful looks in haste
she turns on hospitable thoughts intent
what choice to choose for delicacy best
what order so contrived as not to mix
tastes not well joined inelegant but bring
taste after taste upheld with kindliest change
bestirs her then and from each tender stalk
whatever earth allbearing mother yields
in india east or west or middle shore
in pontus or the punick coast or where
alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat
rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell
she gathers tribute large and on the board
heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape
she crushes inoffensive must and meaths
from many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed
she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed
mean while our primitive great sire to meet
his godlike guest walks forth without more train
accompanied than with his own complete
perfections in himself was all his state
more solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
on princes when their rich retinue long
of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold
dazzles the croud and sets them all agape
nearer his presence adam though not awed
yet with submiss approach and reverence meek
as to a superiour nature bowing low
thus said native of heaven for other place
none can than heaven such glorious shape contain
since by descending from the thrones above
those happy places thou hast deigned a while
to want and honour these vouchsafe with us
two only who yet by sovran gift possess
this spacious ground in yonder shady bower
to rest and what the garden choicest bears
to sit and taste till this meridian heat
be over and the sun more cool decline
whom thus the angelick virtue answered mild
adam i therefore came nor art thou such
created or such place hast here to dwell
as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven
to visit thee lead on then where thy bower
oershades for these midhours till evening rise
i have at will so to the sylvan lodge
they came that like pomonas arbour smiled
with flowerets decked and fragrant smells but eve
undecked save with herself more lovely fair
than woodnymph or the fairest goddess feigned
of three that in mount ida naked strove
stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil
she needed virtueproof no thought infirm
altered her cheek on whom the angel hail
bestowed the holy salutation used
long after to blest mary second eve
hail mother of mankind whose fruitful womb
shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons
than with these various fruits the trees of god
have heaped this tableraised of grassy turf
their table was and mossy seats had round
and on her ample square from side to side
all autumn piled though spring and autumn here
danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold
no fear lest dinner cool when thus began
our author heavenly stranger please to taste
these bounties which our nourisher from whom
all perfect good unmeasured out descends
to us for food and for delight hath caused
the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
to spiritual natures only this i know
that one celestial father gives to all
to whom the angel therefore what he gives
 to man in part
spiritual may of purest spirits be found
no ingrateful food and food alike those pure
intelligential substances require
as doth your rational and both contain
within them every lower faculty
of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste
tasting concoct digest assimilate
and corporeal to incorporeal turn
for know whatever was created needs
to be sustained and fed of elements
the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea
earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
ethereal and as lowest first the moon
whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
vapours not yet into her substance turned
nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
from her moist continent to higher orbs
the sun that light imparts to all receives
from all his alimental recompence
in humid exhalations and at even
sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees
of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
covered with pearly grain yet god hath here
varied his bounty so with new delights
as may compare with heaven and to taste
think not i shall be nice so down they sat
and to their viands fell nor seemingly
the angel nor in mist the common gloss
of theologians but with keen dispatch
of real hunger and concoctive heat
to transubstantiate what redounds transpires
through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire
of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
can turn or holds it possible to turn
metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold
as from the mine mean while at table eve
ministered naked and their flowing cups
with pleasant liquours crowned o innocence
deserving paradise if ever then
then had the sons of god excuse to have been
enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
was understood the injured lovers hell
thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed
not burdened nature sudden mind arose
in adam not to let the occasion pass
given him by this great conference to know
of things above his world and of their being
who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw
transcend his own so far whose radiant forms
divine effulgence whose high power so far
exceeded human and his wary speech
thus to the empyreal minister he framed
inhabitant with god now know i well
thy favour in this honour done to man
under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
to enter and these earthly fruits to taste
food not of angels yet accepted so
as that more willingly thou couldst not seem
at heavens high feasts to have fed yet what compare
to whom the winged hierarch replied
o adam one almighty is from whom
all things proceed and up to him return
if not depraved from good created all
such to perfection one first matter all
endued with various forms various degrees
of substance and in things that live of life
but more refined more spiritous and pure
as nearer to him placed or nearer tending
each in their several active spheres assigned
till body up to spirit work in bounds
proportioned to each kind so from the root
springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
more aery last the bright consummate flower
spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit
mans nourishment by gradual scale sublimed
to vital spirits aspire to animal
to intellectual give both life and sense
fancy and understanding whence the soul
reason receives and reason is her being
discursive or intuitive discourse
is oftest yours the latter most is ours
differing but in degree of kind the same
wonder not then what god for you saw good
if i refuse not but convert as you
to proper substance time may come when men
with angels may participate and find
no inconvenient diet nor too light fare
and from these corporal nutriments perhaps
your bodies may at last turn all to spirit
improved by tract of time and winged ascend
ethereal as we or may at choice
here or in heavenly paradises dwell
if ye be found obedient and retain
unalterably firm his love entire
whose progeny you are mean while enjoy
your fill what happiness this happy state
can comprehend incapable of more
to whom the patriarch of mankind replied
o favourable spirit propitious guest
well hast thou taught the way that might direct
our knowledge and the scale of nature set
from center to circumference whereon
in contemplation of created things
by steps we may ascend to god but say
what meant that caution joined if ye be found
obedient can we want obedience then
to him or possibly his love desert
who formed us from the dust and placed us here
full to the utmost measure of what bliss
human desires can seek or apprehend
to whom the angel son of heaven and earth
attend that thou art happy owe to god
that thou continuest such owe to thyself
that is to thy obedience therein stand
this was that caution given thee be advised
god made thee perfect not immutable
and good he made thee but to persevere
he left it in thy power ordained thy will
by nature free not overruled by fate
inextricable or strict necessity
our voluntary service he requires
not our necessitated such with him
finds no acceptance nor can find for how
can hearts not free be tried whether they serve
willing or no who will but what they must
by destiny and can no other choose
myself and all the angelick host that stand
in sight of god enthroned our happy state
hold as you yours while our obedience holds
on other surety none freely we serve
because we freely love as in our will
to love or not in this we stand or fall
and some are fallen to disobedience fallen
and so from heaven to deepest hell o fall
from what high state of bliss into what woe
to whom our great progenitor thy words
attentive and with more delighted ear
divine instructer i have heard than when
cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
aereal musick send nor knew i not
to be both will and deed created free
yet that we never shall forget to love
our maker and obey him whose command
single is yet so just my constant thoughts
assured me and still assure though what thou tellest
hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move
but more desire to hear if thou consent
the full relation which must needs be strange
worthy of sacred silence to be heard
and we have yet large day for scarce the sun
hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
his other half in the great zone of heaven
thus adam made request and raphael
after short pause assenting thus began
high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men
sad task and hard for how shall i relate
to human sense the invisible exploits
of warring spirits how without remorse
the ruin of so many glorious once
and perfect while they stood how last unfold
the secrets of another world perhaps
not lawful to reveal yet for thy good
this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
of human sense i shall delineate so
by likening spiritual to corporal forms
as may express them best though what if earth
be but a shadow of heaven and things therein
each to other like more than on earth is thought
as yet this world was not and chaos wild
reigned where these heavens now roll where earth now rests
upon her center poised when on a day
 on such day
as heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host
of angels by imperial summons called
innumerable before the almightys throne
forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared
under their hierarchs in orders bright
ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced
standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
stream in the air and for distinction serve
of hierarchies of orders and degrees
or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
holy memorials acts of zeal and love
recorded eminent thus when in orbs
of circuit inexpressible they stood
orb within orb the father infinite
by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son
amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
brightness had made invisible thus spake
hear all ye angels progeny of light
thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers
hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand
this day i have begot whom i declare
my only son and on this holy hill
him have anointed whom ye now behold
at my right hand your head i him appoint
and by myself have sworn to him shall bow
all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord
under his great vicegerent reign abide
united as one individual soul
for ever happy him who disobeys
me disobeys breaks union and that day
cast out from god and blessed vision falls
into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
ordained without redemption without end
so spake the omnipotent and with his words
all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all
that day as other solemn days they spent
in song and dance about the sacred hill
mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
resembles nearest mazes intricate
eccentrick intervolved yet regular
then most when most irregular they seem
and in their motions harmony divine
so smooths her charming tones that gods own ear
listens delighted evening now approached

forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
desirous all in circles as they stood
tables are set and on a sudden piled
with angels food and rubied nectar flows
in pearl in diamond and massy gold
fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven
on flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned
they eat they drink and in communion sweet
quaff immortality and joy secure
of surfeit where full measure only bounds
excess before the allbounteous king who showered
with copious hand rejoicing in their joy
now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
from that high mount of god whence light and shade
spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed
to grateful twilight  and roseate dews disposed
all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest
wide over all the plain and wider far
than all this globous earth in plain outspread
 the angelick throng
dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
by living streams among the trees of life
pavilions numberless and sudden reared
celestial tabernacles where they slept
fanned with cool winds save those who in their course
melodious hymns about the sovran throne
alternate all night long but not so waked
satan so call him now his former name
is heard no more in heaven he of the first
if not the first archangel great in power
in favour and preeminence yet fraught
with envy against the son of god that day
honoured by his great father and proclaimed
messiah king anointed could not bear
through pride that sight and thought himself impaired
deep malice thence conceiving and disdain
soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved
with all his legions to dislodge and leave
unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme
contemptuous and his next subordinate
awakening thus to him in secret spake
sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close
thy eyelids and rememberest what decree
of yesterday so late hath passed the lips
of heavens almighty thou to me thy thoughts
wast wont i mine to thee was wont to impart
both waking we were one how then can now
thy sleep dissent new laws thou seest imposed
new laws from him who reigns new minds may raise
in us who serve new counsels to debate
what doubtful may ensue more in this place
to utter is not safe assemble thou
of all those myriads which we lead the chief
tell them that by command ere yet dim night
her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste
and all who under me their banners wave
homeward with flying march where we possess
the quarters of the north there to prepare
fit entertainment to receive our king
the great messiah and his new commands
who speedily through all the hierarchies
intends to pass triumphant and give laws
so spake the false archangel and infused
bad influence into the unwary breast
of his associate he together calls
or several one by one the regent powers
under him regent tells as he was taught
that the most high commanding now ere night
now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven
the great hierarchal standard was to move
tells the suggested cause and casts between
ambiguous words and jealousies to sound
or taint integrity but all obeyed
the wonted signal and superiour voice
of their great potentate for great indeed
his name and high was his degree in heaven
his countenance as the morningstar that guides
the starry flock allured them and with lies
drew after him the third part of heavens host
mean while the eternal eye whose sight discerns
abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount
and from within the golden lamps that burn
nightly before him saw without their light
rebellion rising saw in whom how spread
among the sons of morn what multitudes
were banded to oppose his high decree
and smiling to his only son thus said
son thou in whom my glory i behold
in full resplendence heir of all my might
nearly it now concerns us to be sure
of our omnipotence and with what arms
we mean to hold what anciently we claim
of deity or empire such a foe
is rising who intends to erect his throne
equal to ours throughout the spacious north
nor so content hath in his thought to try
in battle what our power is or our right
let us advise and to this hazard draw
with speed what force is left and all employ
in our defence lest unawares we lose
this our high place our sanctuary our hill
to whom the son with calm aspect and clear
lightning divine ineffable serene
made answer mighty father thou thy foes
justly hast in derision and secure
laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain
matter to me of glory whom their hate
illustrates when they see all regal power
given me to quell their pride and in event
know whether i be dextrous to subdue
thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven
so spake the son but satan with his powers
far was advanced on winged speed an host
innumerable as the stars of night
or stars of morning dewdrops which the sun
impearls on every leaf and every flower
regions they passed the mighty regencies
of seraphim and potentates and thrones
in their triple degrees regions to which
all thy dominion adam is no more
than what this garden is to all the earth
and all the sea from one entire globose
stretched into longitude which having passed
at length into the limits of the north
they came and satan to his royal seat
high on a hill far blazing as a mount
raised on a mount with pyramids and towers
from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold
the palace of great lucifer  which not long after he
affecting all equality with god
in imitation of that mount whereon
messiah was declared in sight of heaven
the mountain of the congregation called
for thither he assembled all his train
pretending so commanded to consult
about the great reception of their king
thither to come and with calumnious art
of counterfeited truth thus held their ears
thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers
if these magnifick titles yet remain
not merely titular since by decree
another now hath to himself engrossed
all power and us eclipsed under the name
of king anointed for whom all this haste
of midnightmarch and hurried meeting here
this only to consult how we may best
with what may be devised of honours new
receive him coming to receive from us
kneetribute yet unpaid prostration vile
too much to one but double how endured
to one and to his image now proclaimed
but what if better counsels might erect
our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke
will ye submit your necks and choose to bend
the supple knee ye will not if i trust
to know ye right or if ye know yourselves
natives and sons of heaven possessed before
by none and if not equal all yet free
equally free for orders and degrees
jar not with liberty but well consist
who can in reason then or right assume
monarchy over such as live by right
his equals if in power and splendour less
in freedom equal or can introduce
law and edict on us who without law
err not much less for this to be our lord
and look for adoration to the abuse
of those imperial titles which assert
our being ordained to govern not to serve
thus far his bold discourse without controul
had audience when among the seraphim
abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored
the deity and divine commands obeyed
stood up and in a flame of zeal severe
the current of his fury thus opposed
o argument blasphemous false and proud
words which no ear ever to hear in heaven
expected least of all from thee ingrate
in place thyself so high above thy peers
canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
the just decree of god pronounced and sworn
that to his only son by right endued
with regal scepter every soul in heaven
shall bend the knee and in that honour due
confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest
flatly unjust to bind with laws the free
and equal over equals to let reign
one over all with unsucceeded power
shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute
with him the points of liberty who made
thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven
such as he pleased and circumscribed their being
yet by experience taught we know how good
and of our good and of our dignity
how provident he is how far from thought
to make us less bent rather to exalt
our happy state under one head more near
united but to grant it thee unjust
that equal over equals monarch reign
thyself though great and glorious dost thou count
or all angelick nature joined in one
equal to him begotten son by whom
as by his word the mighty father made
all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven
by him created in their bright degrees
crowned them with glory and to their glory named
thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers
essential powers nor by his reign obscured
but more illustrious made since he the head
one of our number thus reduced becomes
his laws our laws all honour to him done
returns our own cease then this impious rage
and tempt not these but hasten to appease
the incensed father and the incensed son
while pardon may be found in time besought
so spake the fervent angel but his zeal
none seconded as out of season judged
or singular and rash whereat rejoiced
the apostate and more haughty thus replied
that we were formed then sayest thou and the work
of secondary hands by task transferred
from father to his son strange point and new
doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw
when this creation was rememberest thou
thy making while the maker gave thee being
we know no time when we were not as now
know none before us selfbegot selfraised
by our own quickening power when fatal course
had circled his full orb the birth mature
of this our native heaven ethereal sons
our puissance is our own our own right hand
shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try
who is our equal then thou shalt behold
whether by supplication we intend
address and to begirt the almighty throne
beseeching or besieging this report
these tidings carry to the anointed king
and fly ere evil intercept thy flight
he said and as the sound of waters deep
hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
through the infinite host nor less for that
the flaming seraph fearless though alone
encompassed round with foes thus answered bold
o alienate from god o spirit accursed
forsaken of all good i see thy fall
determined and thy hapless crew involved
in this perfidious fraud contagion spread
both of thy crime and punishment henceforth
no more be troubled how to quit the yoke
of gods messiah those indulgent laws
will not be now vouchsafed other decrees
against thee are gone forth without recall
that golden scepter which thou didst reject
is now an iron rod to bruise and break
thy disobedience well thou didst advise
yet not for thy advice or threats i fly
these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath
impendent raging into sudden flame
distinguish not for soon expect to feel
his thunder on thy head devouring fire
then who created thee lamenting learn
when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know
so spake the seraph abdiel faithful found
among the faithless faithful only he
among innumerable false unmoved
unshaken unseduced unterrified
his loyalty he kept his love his zeal
nor number nor example with him wrought
to swerve from truth or change his constant mind
though single from amidst them forth he passed
long way through hostile scorn which he sustained
superiour nor of violence feared aught
and with retorted scorn his back he turned
on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed






all night the dreadless angel unpursued
through heavens wide champain held his way till morn
waked by the circling hours with rosy hand
unbarred the gates of light there is a cave
within the mount of god fast by his throne
where light and darkness in perpetual round
lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven
grateful vicissitude like day and night
light issues forth and at the other door
obsequious darkness enters till her hour
to veil the heaven though darkness there might well
seem twilight here and now went forth the morn
such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold
empyreal from before her vanished night
shot through with orient beams when all the plain
covered with thick embattled squadrons bright
chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds
reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view
war he perceived war in procinct and found
already known what he for news had thought
to have reported gladly then he mixed
among those friendly powers who him received
with joy and acclamations loud that one
that of so many myriads fallen yet one
returned not lost on to the sacred hill
they led him high applauded and present
before the seat supreme from whence a voice
from midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard
servant of god well done well hast thou fought
the better fight who single hast maintained
against revolted multitudes the cause
of truth in word mightier than they in arms
and for the testimony of truth hast borne
universal reproach far worse to bear
than violence for this was all thy care
to stand approved in sight of god though worlds
judged thee perverse the easier conquest now
remains thee aided by this host of friends
back on thy foes more glorious to return
than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue
by force who reason for their law refuse
right reason for their law and for their king
messiah who by right of merit reigns
go michael of celestial armies prince
and thou in military prowess next
gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons
invincible lead forth my armed saints
by thousands and by millions ranged for fight
equal in number to that godless crew
rebellious them with fire and hostile arms
fearless assault and to the brow of heaven
pursuing drive them out from god and bliss
into their place of punishment the gulf
of tartarus which ready opens wide
his fiery chaos to receive their fall
so spake the sovran voice and clouds began
to darken all the hill and smoke to roll
in dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign
of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud
ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow
at which command the powers militant
that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined
of union irresistible moved on
in silence their bright legions to the sound
of instrumental harmony that breathed
heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
under their godlike leaders in the cause
of god and his messiah on they move
indissolubly firm nor obvious hill
nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides
their perfect ranks for high above the ground
their march was and the passive air upbore
their nimble tread as when the total kind
of birds in orderly array on wing
came summoned over eden to receive
their names of thee so over many a tract
of heaven they marched and many a province wide
tenfold the length of this terrene at last
far in the horizon to the north appeared
from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
in battailous aspect and nearer view
bristled with upright beams innumerable
of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
various with boastful argument portrayed
the banded powers of satan hasting on
with furious expedition for they weened
that selfsame day by fight or by surprise
to win the mount of god and on his throne
to set the envier of his state the proud
aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
in the mid way though strange to us it seemed
at first that angel should with angel war
and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
so oft in festivals of joy and love
unanimous as sons of one great sire
hymning the eternal father but the shout
of battle now began and rushing sound
of onset ended soon each milder thought
high in the midst exalted as a god
the apostate in his sunbright chariot sat
idol of majesty divine enclosed
with flaming cherubim and golden shields
then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
twixt host and host but narrow space was left
a dreadful interval and front to front
presented stood in terrible array
of hideous length before the cloudy van
on the rough edge of battle ere it joined
satan with vast and haughty strides advanced
came towering armed in adamant and gold
abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
among the mightiest bent on highest deeds
and thus his own undaunted heart explores
o heaven that such resemblance of the highest
should yet remain where faith and realty
remain not wherefore should not strength and might
there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
where boldest though to fight unconquerable
his puissance trusting in the almightys aid
i mean to try whose reason i have tried
unsound and false nor is it aught but just
that he who in debate of truth hath won
should win in arms in both disputes alike
victor though brutish that contest and foul
when reason hath to deal with force yet so
most reason is that reason overcome
so pondering and from his armed peers
forth stepping opposite halfway he met
his daring foe at this prevention more
incensed and thus securely him defied
proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached
the highth of thy aspiring unopposed
the throne of god unguarded and his side
abandoned at the terrour of thy power
or potent tongue fool not to think how vain
against the omnipotent to rise in arms
who out of smallest things could without end
have raised incessant armies to defeat
thy folly or with solitary hand
reaching beyond all limit at one blow
unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
thy legions under darkness but thou seest
all are not of thy train there be who faith
prefer and piety to god though then
to thee not visible when i alone
seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
from all my sect thou seest now learn too late
how few sometimes may know when thousands err
whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour
of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
from flight seditious angel to receive
thy merited reward the first assay
of this right hand provoked since first that tongue
inspired with contradiction durst oppose
a third part of the gods in synod met
their deities to assert who while they feel
vigour divine within them can allow
omnipotence to none but well thou comest
before thy fellows ambitious to win
from me some plume that thy success may show
destruction to the rest this pause between
 to let thee know
at first i thought that liberty and heaven
to heavenly souls had been all one but now
i see that most through sloth had rather serve
ministring spirits trained up in feast and song
such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of heaven
servility with freedom to contend
as both their deeds compared this day shall prove
to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied
apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
of erring from the path of truth remote
unjustly thou depravest it with the name
of servitude to serve whom god ordains
or nature god and nature bid the same
when he who rules is worthiest and excels
them whom he governs this is servitude
to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
against his worthier as thine now serve thee
thyself not free but to thyself enthralled
yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid
reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve
in heaven god ever blest and his divine
behests obey worthiest to be obeyed
yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while
from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight
this greeting on thy impious crest receive
so saying a noble stroke he lifted high
which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
on the proud crest of satan that no sight
nor motion of swift thought less could his shield
such ruin intercept ten paces huge
he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
his massy spear upstaid as if on earth
winds under ground or waters forcing way
sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat
half sunk with all his pines amazement seised
the rebel thrones but greater rage to see
thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout
presage of victory and fierce desire
of battle whereat michael bid sound
the archangel trumpet through the vast of heaven
it sounded and the faithful armies rung
hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze
the adverse legions nor less hideous joined
the horrid shock now storming fury rose
and clamour such as heard in heaven till now
was never arms on armour clashing brayed
horrible discord and the madding wheels
of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
of conflict over head the dismal hiss
of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew
and flying vaulted either host with fire
so under fiery cope together rushed
both battles main with ruinous assault
and inextinguishable rage all heaven
resounded and had earth been then all earth
had to her center shook what wonder when
millions of fierce encountering angels fought
on either side the least of whom could wield
these elements and arm him with the force
of all their regions how much more of power
army against army numberless to raise
dreadful combustion warring and disturb
though not destroy their happy native seat
had not the eternal king omnipotent
from his strong hold of heaven high overruled
and limited their might though numbered such
as each divided legion might have seemed
a numerous host in strength each armed hand
a legion led in fight yet leader seemed
each warriour single as in chief expert
when to advance or stand or turn the sway
of battle open when and when to close
the ridges of grim war no thought of flight
none of retreat no unbecoming deed
that argued fear each on himself relied
as only in his arm the moment lay
of victory deeds of eternal fame
were done but infinite for wide was spread
that war and various sometimes on firm ground
a standing fight then soaring on main wing
tormented all the air all air seemed then
conflicting fire long time in even scale
the battle hung till satan who that day
prodigious power had shown and met in arms
no equal ranging through the dire attack
of fighting seraphim confused at length
saw where the sword of michael smote and felled
squadrons at once with huge twohanded sway
brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
widewasting such destruction to withstand
he hasted and opposed the rocky orb
of tenfold adamant his ample shield
a vast circumference at his approach
the great archangel from his warlike toil
surceased and glad as hoping here to end
intestine war in heaven the archfoe subdued
or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
and visage all inflamed first thus began
author of evil unknown till thy revolt
unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest
these acts of hateful strife hateful to all
though heaviest by just measure on thyself
and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed
heavens blessed peace and into nature brought
misery uncreated till the crime
of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
thy malice into thousands once upright
and faithful now proved false but think not here
to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out
from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss
brooks not the works of violence and war
hence then and evil go with thee along
thy offspring to the place of evil hell
thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils
ere this avenging sword begin thy doom
or some more sudden vengeance winged from god
precipitate thee with augmented pain
so spake the prince of angels to whom thus
the adversary nor think thou with wind
of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these
to flight or if to fall but that they rise
unvanquished easier to transact with me
that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
to chase me hence err not that so shall end
the strife which thou callest evil but we style
the strife of glory which we mean to win
or turn this heaven itself into the hell
thou fablest here however to dwell free
if not to reign mean while thy utmost force
and join him named almighty to thy aid
i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh
they ended parle and both addressed for fight
unspeakable for who though with the tongue
of angels can relate or to what things
liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
human imagination to such highth
of godlike power for likest gods they seemed
stood they or moved in stature motion arms
fit to decide the empire of great heaven
now waved their fiery swords and in the air
made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
blazed opposite while expectation stood
in horrour from each hand with speed retired
where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng
and left large field unsafe within the wind
of such commotion such as to set forth
great things by small if natures concord broke
among the constellations war were sprung
two planets rushing from aspect malign
of fiercest opposition in mid sky
should combat and their jarring spheres confound
together both with next to almighty arm
uplifted imminent one stroke they aimed
that might determine and not need repeat
as not of power at once nor odds appeared
in might or swift prevention but the sword
of michael from the armoury of god
was given him tempered so that neither keen
nor solid might resist that edge it met
the sword of satan with steep force to smite
descending and in half cut sheer nor staid
but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared
all his right side then satan first knew pain
and writhed him to and fro convolved so sore
the griding sword with discontinuous wound
passed through him but the ethereal substance closed
not long divisible and from the gash
a stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed
and all his armour stained ere while so bright
forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
by angels many and strong who interposed
defence while others bore him on their shields
back to his chariot where it stood retired
from off the files of war there they him laid
gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
to find himself not matchless and his pride
humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
his confidence to equal god in power
yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout
vital in every part not as frail man
in entrails heart of head liver or reins
cannot but by annihilating die
nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
receive no more than can the fluid air
all heart they live all head all eye all ear
all intellect all sense and as they please
they limb themselves and colour shape or size
assume as likes them best condense or rare
mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
memorial where the might of gabriel fought
and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
of moloch furious king who him defied
and at his chariotwheels to drag him bound
threatened nor from the holy one of heaven
refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon
down cloven to the waist with shattered arms
and uncouth pain fled bellowing on each wing
uriel and raphael his vaunting foe
though huge and in a rock of diamond armed
vanquished adramelech and asmadai
two potent thrones that to be less than gods
disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight
mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail
nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy
the atheist crew but with redoubled blow
ariel and arioch and the violence
of ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew
i might relate of thousands and their names
eternize here on earth but those elect
angels contented with their fame in heaven
seek not the praise of men the other sort
in might though wonderous and in acts of war
nor of renown less eager yet by doom
cancelled from heaven and sacred memory
nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell
for strength from truth divided and from just
illaudable nought merits but dispraise
and ignominy yet to glory aspires
vainglorious and through infamy seeks fame
therefore eternal silence be their doom
and now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved
with many an inroad gored deformed rout
entered and foul disorder all the ground
with shivered armour strown and on a heap
chariot and charioteer lay overturned
and fieryfoaming steeds what stood recoiled
oerwearied through the faint satanick host
defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised
then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
fled ignominious to such evil brought
by sin of disobedience till that hour
not liable to fear or flight or pain
far otherwise the inviolable saints
in cubick phalanx firm advanced entire
invulnerable impenetrably armed
such high advantages their innocence
gave them above their foes not to have sinned
not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
unwearied unobnoxious to be pained
by wound though from their place by violence moved
now night her course began and over heaven
inducing darkness grateful truce imposed
and silence on the odious din of war
under her cloudy covert both retired
victor and vanquished on the foughten field
michael and his angels prevalent
encamping placed in guard their watches round
cherubick waving fires on the other part
satan with his rebellious disappeared
far in the dark dislodged and void of rest
his potentates to council called by night
and in the midst thus undismayed began
o now in danger tried now known in arms
not to be overpowered companions dear
found worthy not of liberty alone
too mean pretence but what we more affect
honour dominion glory and renown
who have sustained one day in doubtful fight

what heavens lord had powerfullest to send
against us from about his throne and judged
sufficient to subdue us to his will
but proves not so then fallible it seems
of future we may deem him though till now
omniscient thought true is less firmly armed
some disadvantage we endured and pain
till now not known but known as soon contemned
since now we find this our empyreal form
incapable of mortal injury
imperishable and though pierced with wound
soon closing and by native vigour healed
of evil then so small as easy think
the remedy perhaps more valid arms
weapons more violent when next we meet
may serve to better us and worse our foes
or equal what between us made the odds
in nature none if other hidden cause
left them superiour while we can preserve
unhurt our minds and understanding sound
due search and consultation will disclose
he sat and in the assembly next upstood
nisroch of principalities the prime
as one he stood escaped from cruel fight
sore toiled his riven arms to havock hewn
and cloudy in aspect thus answering spake
deliverer from new lords leader to free
enjoyment of our right as gods yet hard
for gods and too unequal work we find
against unequal arms to fight in pain
against unpained impassive from which evil
ruin must needs ensue for what avails
valour or strength though matchless quelled with pain
which all subdues and makes remiss the hands
of mightiest sense of pleasure we may well
spare out of life perhaps and not repine
but live content which is the calmest life
but pain is perfect misery the worst
of evils and excessive overturns
all patience he who therefore can invent
with what more forcible we may offend
our yet unwounded enemies or arm
ourselves with like defence to me deserves
no less than for deliverance what we owe
whereto with look composed satan replied
not uninvented that which thou aright
believest so main to our success i bring
which of us who beholds the bright surface
of this ethereous mould whereon we stand
this continent of spacious heaven adorned
with plant fruit flower ambrosial gems and gold
whose eye so superficially surveys
these things as not to mind from whence they grow
deep under ground materials dark and crude
of spiritous and fiery spume till touched
with heavens ray and tempered they shoot forth
so beauteous opening to the ambient light
these in their dark nativity the deep
shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame
which into hollow engines long and round
thick rammed at the other bore with touch of fire
dilated and infuriate shall send forth
from far with thundering noise among our foes
such implements of mischief as shall dash
to pieces and oerwhelm whatever stands
adverse that they shall fear we have disarmed
the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt
nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn
effect shall end our wish mean while revive
abandon fear to strength and counsel joined
think nothing hard much less to be despaired
he ended and his words their drooping cheer
enlightened and their languished hope revived
the invention all admired and each how he
to be the inventer missed so easy it seemed
once found which yet unfound most would have thought
impossible yet haply of thy race
in future days if malice should abound
some one intent on mischief or inspired
with devilish machination might devise
like instrument to plague the sons of men
for sin on war and mutual slaughter bent
forthwith from council to the work they flew
none arguing stood innumerable hands
were ready in a moment up they turned
wide the celestial soil and saw beneath
the originals of nature in their crude
conception sulphurous and nitrous foam
they found they mingled and with subtle art
concocted and adusted they reduced
to blackest grain and into store conveyed
part hidden veins digged up  of mineral and stone
whereof to found their engines and their balls
of missive ruin part incentive reed
provide pernicious with one touch to fire
so all ere dayspring under conscious night
secret they finished and in order set
with silent circumspection unespied
now when fair morn orient in heaven appeared
up rose the victorangels and to arms
the matin trumpet sung in arms they stood
of golden panoply refulgent host
soon banded others from the dawning hills
look round and scouts each coast lightarmed scour
each quarter to descry the distant foe
where lodged or whither fled or if for fight
in motion or in halt him soon they met
under spread ensigns moving nigh in slow
but firm battalion back with speediest sail
zophiel of cherubim the swiftest wing
came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried
arm warriours arm for fight the foe at hand
whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit
this day fear not his flight so thick a cloud
he comes and settled in his face i see
sad resolution and secure let each
his adamantine coat gird well and each
fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield
borne even or high for this day will pour down
if i conjecture aught no drizzling shower
but rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire
so warned he them aware themselves and soon
in order quit of all impediment
instant without disturb they took alarm
and onward moved embattled when behold
not distant far with heavy pace the foe
approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
training his devilish enginery impaled
on every side with shadowing squadrons deep
to hide the fraud at interview both stood
a while but suddenly at head appeared
satan and thus was heard commanding loud
vanguard to right and left the front unfold
that all may see who hate us how we seek
peace and composure and with open breast
stand ready to receive them if they like
our overture and turn not back perverse
but that i doubt however witness heaven
heaven witness thou anon while we discharge
freely our part ye who appointed stand
do as you have in charge and briefly touch
what we propound and loud that all may hear
so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
had ended when to right and left the front
divided and to either flank retired
which to our eyes discovered new and strange
a triple mounted row of pillars laid
on wheels 
brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
with hideous orifice gaped on us wide
portending hollow truce at each behind
a seraph stood and in his hand a reed
stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense
collected stood within our thoughts amused
not long for sudden all at once their reeds
put forth and to a narrow vent applied
with nicest touch immediate in a flame
but soon obscured with smoke all heaven appeared
from those deepthroated engines belched whose roar
embowelled with outrageous noise the air
and all her entrails tore disgorging foul
their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
of iron globes which on the victor host
levelled with such impetuous fury smote
that whom they hit none on their feet might stand
though standing else as rocks but down they fell
by thousands angel on archangel rolled
the sooner for their arms unarmed they might
have easily as spirits evaded swift
by quick contraction or remove but now
foul dissipation followed and forced rout
nor served it to relax their serried files
what should they do if on they rushed repulse
repeated and indecent overthrow
doubled would render them yet more despised
and to their foes a laughter for in view
stood ranked of seraphim another row
in posture to displode their second tire
of thunder back defeated to return
they worse abhorred satan beheld their plight
and to his mates thus in derision called
o friends why come not on these victors proud
ere while they fierce were coming and when we
to entertain them fair with open front
and breast  propounded terms
of composition straight they changed their minds
flew off and into strange vagaries fell
as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
for joy of offered peace but i suppose
if our proposals once again were heard
we should compel them to a quick result
to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood
leader the terms we sent were terms of weight
of hard contents and full of force urged home
such as we might perceive amused them all
and stumbled many who receives them right
had need from head to foot well understand
not understood this gift they have besides
they show us when our foes walk not upright
so they among themselves in pleasant vein
stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond
all doubt of victory eternal might
to match with their inventions they presumed
so easy and of his thunder made a scorn
and all his host derided while they stood
a while in trouble but they stood not long
rage prompted them at length and found them arms
against such hellish mischief fit to oppose
forthwith 
their arms away they threw and to the hills

light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew
from their foundations loosening to and fro
they plucked the seated hills with all their load
rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
uplifting bore them in their hands amaze
be sure and terrour seized the rebel host
when coming towards them so dread they saw
the bottom of the mountains upward turned
till on those cursed engines triplerow
they saw them whelmed and all their confidence
under the weight of mountains buried deep
themselves invaded next and on their heads
main promontories flung which in the air
came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed
their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised
into their substance pent which wrought them pain
implacable and many a dolorous groan
long struggling underneath ere they could wind
out of such prison though spirits of purest light
purest at first now gross by sinning grown
the rest in imitation to like arms
betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore
so hills amid the air encountered hills
hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
that under ground they fought in dismal shade
infernal noise war seemed a civil game
to this uproar horrid confusion heaped
upon confusion rose and now all heaven
had gone to wrack with ruin overspread
had not the almighty father where he sits
shrined in his sanctuary of heaven secure
consulting on the sum of things foreseen
this tumult and permitted all advised
that his great purpose he might so fulfil
to honour his anointed son avenged
upon his enemies and to declare
all power on him transferred whence to his son
the assessour of his throne he thus began
effulgence of my glory son beloved
son in whose face invisible is beheld
visibly what by deity i am
and in whose hand what by decree i do
second omnipotence two days are past
two days as we compute the days of heaven
since michael and his powers went forth to tame
these disobedient sore hath been their fight
as likeliest was when two such foes met armed
for to themselves i left them and thou knowest
equal in their creation they were formed
save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
insensibly for i suspend their doom
whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
endless and no solution will be found
war wearied hath performed what war can do
and to disordered rage let loose the reins
with mountains as with weapons armed which makes
wild work in heaven and dangerous to the main
two days are therefore past the third is thine
for thee i have ordained it and thus far
have suffered that the glory may be thine
of ending this great war since none but thou
can end it into thee such virtue and grace
immense i have transfused that all may know
in heaven and hell thy power above compare
and this perverse commotion governed thus
to manifest thee worthiest to be heir
of all things to be heir and to be king
by sacred unction thy deserved right
go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might
ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
that shake heavens basis bring forth all my war
my bow and thunder my almighty arms
gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh
pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
from all heavens bounds into the utter deep
there let them learn as likes them to despise
god and messiah his anointed king
he said and on his son with rays direct
shone full he all his father full expressed
ineffably into his face received
and thus the filial godhead answering spake
o father o supreme of heavenly thrones
first highest holiest best thou always seekst
to glorify thy son i always thee
as is most just this i my glory account
my exaltation and my whole delight
that thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss
scepter and power thy giving i assume
and gladlier shall resign when in the end
thou shalt be all in all and i in thee
for ever and in me all whom thou lovest
but whom thou hatest i hate and can put on
thy terrours as i put thy mildness on
image of thee in all things and shall soon
armed with thy might rid heaven of these rebelled
to their prepared ill mansion driven down
to chains of darkness and the undying worm
that from thy just obedience could revolt
whom to obey is happiness entire
then shall thy saints unmixed and from the impure
far separate circling thy holy mount
unfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing
hymns of high praise and i among them chief
so said he oer his scepter bowing rose
from the right hand of glory where he sat
and the third sacred morn began to shine
dawning through heaven forth rushed with whirlwind sound
the chariot of paternal deity
flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn
itself instinct with spirit but convoyed
by four cherubick shapes four faces each
had wonderous as with stars their bodies all
and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
of beryl and careering fires between
over their heads a crystal firmament
whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure
amber and colours of the showery arch
he in celestial panoply all armed
of radiant urim work divinely wrought
ascended at his right hand victory
sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow
and quiver with threebolted thunder stored
and from about him fierce effusion rolled
of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire
attended with ten thousand thousand saints
he onward came far off his coming shone
and twenty thousand 
chariots of god half on each hand were seen
he on the wings of cherub rode sublime
on the crystalline sky in sapphire throned
illustrious far and wide but by his own
first seen them unexpected joy surprised
when the great ensign of messiah blazed
aloft by angels borne his sign in heaven
under whose conduct michael soon reduced
his army circumfused on either wing
under their head imbodied all in one
before him power divine his way prepared
at his command the uprooted hills retired
each to his place they heard his voice and went
obsequious heaven his wonted face renewed
and with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled
this saw his hapless foes but stood obdured
and to rebellious fight rallied their powers
insensate hope conceiving from despair
in heavenly spirits could such perverseness dwell
but to convince the proud what signs avail
or wonders move the obdurate to relent
they hardened more by what might most reclaim
grieving to see his glory at the sight
took envy and aspiring to his highth
stood reembattled fierce by force or fraud
weening to prosper and at length prevail
against god and messiah or to fall
in universal ruin last and now
to final battle drew disdaining flight
or faint retreat when the great son of god
to all his host on either hand thus spake
stand still in bright array ye saints here stand
ye angels armed this day from battle rest
faithful hath been your warfare and of god
accepted fearless in his righteous cause
and as ye have received so have ye done
invincibly but of this cursed crew
the punishment to other hand belongs
vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints
number to this days work is not ordained
nor multitude stand only and behold
gods indignation on these godless poured
by me not you but me they have despised
yet envied against me is all their rage
because the father to whom in heaven spreme
kingdom and power and glory appertains
hath honoured me according to his will
therefore to me their doom he hath assigned
that they may have their wish to try with me
in battle which the stronger proves they all
or i alone against them since by strength
they measure all of other excellence
not emulous nor care who them excels
nor other strife with them do i vouchsafe
so spake the son and into terrour changed
his countenance too severe to be beheld
and full of wrath bent on his enemies
at once the four spread out their starry wings
with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs
of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound
of torrent floods or of a numerous host
he on his impious foes right onward drove
gloomy as night under his burning wheels
the stedfast empyrean shook throughout
all but the throne itself of god full soon
among them he arrived in his right hand
grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent
before him such as in their souls infixed
plagues they astonished all resistance lost
all courage down their idle weapons dropt
oer shields and helms and helmed heads he rode
of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate
that wished the mountains now might be again
thrown on them as a shelter from his ire
nor less on either side tempestuous fell
his arrows from the fourfoldvisaged four
distinct with eyes and from the living wheels
distinct alike with multitude of eyes
one spirit in them ruled and every eye
glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
among the accursed that withered all their strength
and of their wonted vigour left them drained
exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen
yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
his thunder in mid volley for he meant
not to destroy but root them out of heaven
the overthrown he raised and as a herd
of goats or timorous flock together thronged
drove them before him thunderstruck pursued
with terrours and with furies to the bounds
and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide
rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight
struck them with horrour backward but far worse
urged them behind headlong themselves they threw
down from the verge of heaven eternal wrath
burnt after them to the bottomless pit
hell heard the unsufferable noise hell saw
heaven ruining from heaven and would have fled
affrighted but strict fate had cast too deep
her dark foundations and too fast had bound
nine days they fell confounded chaos roared
and felt tenfold confusion in their fall
through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
incumbered him with ruin hell at last
yawning received them whole and on them closed
hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
unquenchable the house of woe and pain
disburdened heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
her mural breach returning whence it rolled
sole victor from the expulsion of his foes
messiah his triumphal chariot turned
to meet him all his saints who silent stood
eyewitnesses of his almighty acts
with jubilee advanced and as they went
shaded with branching palm each order bright
sung triumph and him sung victorious king
son heir and lord to him dominion given
worthiest to reign he celebrated rode
triumphant through mid heaven into the courts
and temple of his mighty father throned
on high who into glory him received
where now he sits at the right hand of bliss
thus measuring things in heaven by things on earth
at thy request and that thou mayest beware
by what is past to thee i have revealed
what might have else to human race been hid
the discord which befel and war in heaven
among the angelick powers and the deep fall
of those too high aspiring who rebelled
with satan he who envies now thy state
who now is plotting how he may seduce
thee also from obedience that with him
bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
his punishment eternal misery
which would be all his solace and revenge
as a despite done against the most high
thee once to gain companion of his woe
but listen not to his temptations warn
thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard
by terrible example the reward
of disobedience firm they might have stood
yet fell remember and fear to transgress







descend from heaven urania by that name
if rightly thou art called whose voice divine
following above the olympian hill i soar
above the flight of pegasean wing
the meaning not the name i call for thou
nor of the muses nine nor on the top
of old olympus dwellest but heavenlyborn
before the hills appeared or fountain flowed
thou with eternal wisdom didst converse
wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
in presence of the almighty father pleased
with thy celestial song up led by thee
into the heaven of heavens i have presumed
an earthly guest and drawn empyreal air
thy tempering with like safety guided down
return me to my native element
lest from this flying steed unreined 
dismounted on the aleian field i fall
erroneous there to wander and forlorn
half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
within the visible diurnal sphere
standing on earth not rapt above the pole
more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged
to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days
on evil days though fallen and evil tongues
in darkness and with dangers compassed round
and solitude yet not alone while thou
visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
purples the east still govern thou my song
urania and fit audience find though few
but drive far off the barbarous dissonance
of bacchus and his revellers the race
of that wild rout that tore the thracian bard
in rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
to rapture till the savage clamour drowned
both harp and voice nor could the muse defend
her son so fail not thou who thee implores
for thou art heavenly she an empty dream
say goddess what ensued when raphael
the affable archangel had forewarned
adam by dire example to beware
apostasy by what befel in heaven
to those apostates lest the like befall
in paradise to adam or his race
charged not to touch the interdicted tree
if they transgress and slight that sole command
so easily obeyed amid the choice
of all tastes else to please their appetite
though wandering he with his consorted eve
the story heard attentive and was filled
with admiration and deep muse to hear
of things so high and strange things to their thought
so unimaginable as hate in heaven
and war so near the peace of god in bliss
with such confusion but the evil soon
driven back redounded as a flood on those
from whom it sprung impossible to mix
with blessedness whence adam soon repealed
the doubts that in his heart arose and now
led on yet sinless with desire to know
what nearer might concern him how this world
of heaven and earth conspicuous first began
when and whereof created for what cause
what within eden or without was done
before his memory as one whose drouth
yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream
whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites
proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest
great things and full of wonder in our ears
far differing from this world thou hast revealed
divine interpreter by favour sent
down from the empyrean to forewarn
us timely of what might else have been our loss
unknown which human knowledge could not reach
for which to the infinitely good we owe
immortal thanks and his admonishment
receive with solemn purpose to observe
immutably his sovran will the end
of what we are but since thou hast vouchsafed
gently for our instruction to impart
things above earthly thought which yet concerned
our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed
deign to descend now lower and relate
what may no less perhaps avail us known
how first began this heaven which we behold
distant so high with moving fires adorned
innumerable and this which yields or fills
all space the ambient air wide interfused
embracing round this floried earth what cause
moved the creator in his holy rest
through all eternity so late to build
in chaos and the work begun how soon
absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
what we not to explore the secrets ask
of his eternal empire but the more
to magnify his works the more we know
and the great light of day yet wants to run
much of his race though steep suspense in heaven
held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears
and longer will delay to hear thee tell
his generation and the rising birth
of nature from the unapparent deep
or if the star of evening and the moon
haste to thy audience night with her will bring
silence and sleep listening to thee will watch
or we can bid his absence till thy song
end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine
thus adam his illustrious guest besought
and thus the godlike angel answered mild
this also thy request with caution asked
obtain though to recount almighty works
what words or tongue of seraph can suffice
or heart of man suffice to comprehend
yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
to glorify the maker and infer
thee also happier shall not be withheld
thy hearing such commission from above
i have received to answer thy desire
of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
to ask nor let thine own inventions hope
things not revealed which the invisible king
only omniscient hath suppressed in night
to none communicable in earth or heaven
enough is left besides to search and know
but knowledge is as food and needs no less
her temperance over appetite to know
in measure what the mind may well contain
oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind
know then that after lucifer from heaven

fell with his flaming legions through the deep
into his place and the great son returned
victorious with his saints the omnipotent
eternal father from his throne beheld
their multitude and to his son thus spake
at least our envious foe hath failed who thought
all like himself rebellious by whose aid
this inaccessible high strength the seat
of deity supreme us dispossessed
he trusted to have seised and into fraud
drew many whom their place knows here no more
yet far the greater part have kept i see
their station heaven yet populous retains
number sufficient to possess her realms
though wide and this high temple to frequent
with ministeries due and solemn rites
but lest his heart exalt him in the harm
already done to have dispeopled heaven
my damage fondly deemed i can repair
that detriment if such it be to lose
selflost and in a moment will create
another world out of one man a race
of men innumerable there to dwell
not here till by degrees of merit raised
they open to themselves at length the way
up hither under long obedience tried
and earth be changed to heaven and heaven to earth
one kingdom joy and union without end
mean while inhabit lax ye powers of heaven
and thou my word begotten son by thee
this i perform speak thou and be it done
my overshadowing spirit and might with thee
i send along ride forth and bid the deep
within appointed bounds be heaven and earth
boundless the deep because i am who fill
infinitude nor vacuous the space
though i uncircumscribed myself retire
and put not forth my goodness which is free
to act or not necessity and chance
approach not me and what i will is fate
so spake the almighty and to what he spake
his word the filial godhead gave effect
immediate are the acts of god more swift
than time or motion but to human ears
cannot without process of speech be told
so told as earthly notion can receive
great triumph and rejoicing was in heaven
when such was heard declared the almightys will
glory they sung to the most high good will
to future men and in their dwellings peace
glory to him whose just avenging ire
had driven out the ungodly from his sight
and the habitations of the just to him
glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained
good out of evil to create instead
of spirits malign a better race to bring
into their vacant room and thence diffuse
his good to worlds and ages infinite
so sang the hierarchies mean while the son
on his great expedition now appeared
girt with omnipotence with radiance crowned
of majesty divine sapience and love
immense and all his father in him shone
about his chariot numberless were poured
cherub and seraph potentates and thrones
and virtues winged spirits and chariots winged
from the armoury of god where stand of old
myriads between two brazen mountains lodged
against a solemn day harnessed at hand
celestial equipage and now came forth
spontaneous for within them spirit lived
attendant on their lord heaven opened wide
her everduring gates harmonious sound
on golden hinges moving to let forth
the king of glory in his powerful word
and spirit coming to create new worlds
on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore
they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild
up from the bottom turned by furious winds
and surging waves as mountains to assault
heavens highth and with the center mix the pole
silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace
said then the omnifick word your discord end
nor staid but on the wings of cherubim
uplifted in paternal glory rode
far into chaos and the world unborn
for chaos heard his voice him all his train
followed in bright procession to behold
creation and the wonders of his might
then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand
he took the golden compasses prepared
in gods eternal store to circumscribe
this universe and all created things
one foot he centered and the other turned
round through the vast profundity obscure
and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds
this be thy just circumference o world
thus god the heaven created thus the earth
matter unformed and void darkness profound
covered the abyss but on the watery calm
his brooding wings the spirit of god outspread
and vital virtue infused and vital warmth
throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
the black tartareous cold infernal dregs
adverse to life then founded then conglobed
like things to like the rest to several place
disparted and between spun out the air
and earth selfbalanced on her center hung
let there be light said god and forthwith light
ethereal first of things quintessence pure
sprung from the deep and from her native east
to journey through the aery gloom began
sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
sojourned the while god saw the light was good
and light from darkness by the hemisphere
divided light the day and darkness night
he named thus was the first day even and morn
nor past uncelebrated nor unsung
by the celestial quires when orient light
exhaling first from darkness they beheld
birthday of heaven and earth with joy and shout
the hollow universal orb they filled
and touched their golden harps and hymning praised
god and his works creator him they sung
both when first evening was and when first morn
again god said let there be firmament
amid the waters and let it divide
the waters from the waters and god made
the firmament expanse of liquid pure
transparent elemental air diffused
in circuit to the uttermost convex
of this great round partition firm and sure
the waters underneath from those above
dividing for as earth so he the world
built on circumfluous waters calm in wide
crystalline ocean and the loud misrule
of chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
contiguous might distemper the whole frame
and heaven he named the firmament so even
and morning chorus sung the second day
the earth was formed but in the womb as yet
of waters embryon immature involved
appeared not over all the face of earth
main ocean flowed not idle but with warm
prolifick humour softening all her globe
fermented the great mother to conceive
satiate with genial moisture when god said
be gathered now ye waters under heaven
into one place and let dry land appear
immediately the mountains huge appear
emergent and their broad bare backs upheave
into the clouds their tops ascend the sky
so high as heaved the tumid hills so low
down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep
capacious bed of waters thither they
hasted with glad precipitance uprolled
as drops on dust conglobing from the dry
part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct
for haste such flight the great command impressed
on the swift floods as armies at the call
of trumpet 
troop to their standard so the watery throng
wave rolling after wave where way they found
if steep with torrent rapture if through plain
softebbing nor withstood them rock or hill
but they or under ground or circuit wide
with serpent errour wandering found their way
and on the washy oose deep channels wore
easy ere god had bid the ground be dry
all but within those banks where rivers now
stream and perpetual draw their humid train
the dry land earth and the great receptacle
of congregated waters he called seas
and saw that it was good and said let the earth
put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed
and fruittree yielding fruit after her kind
whose seed is in herself upon the earth
he scarce had said when the bare earth till then
desart and bare unsightly unadorned
brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
her universal face with pleasant green
then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
opening their various colours and made gay
her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown
forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
the swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
embattled in her field and the humble shrub
and bush with frizzled hair implicit last
rose as in dance the stately trees and spread
their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed
their blossoms with high woods the hills were crowned
with tufts the valleys and each fountain side
with borders long the rivers that earth now
seemed like to heaven a seat where gods might dwell
or wander with delight and love to haunt
her sacred shades though god had yet not rained
upon the earth and man to till the ground
none was but from the earth a dewy mist
went up and watered all the ground and each
plant of the field which ere it was in the earth
god made and every herb before it grew
on the green stem god saw that it was good
so even and morn recorded the third day
again the almighty spake let there be lights
high in the expanse of heaven to divide
the day from night and let them be for signs
for seasons and for days and circling years
and let them be for lights as i ordain
their office in the firmament of heaven
to give light on the earth and it was so
and god made two great lights great for their use
to man the greater to have rule by day
the less by night altern and made the stars
and set them in the firmament of heaven
to illuminate the earth and rule the day
in their vicissitude and rule the night
and light from darkness to divide god saw
surveying his great work that it was good
for of celestial bodies first the sun
a mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first
though of ethereal mould then formed the moon
globose and every magnitude of stars
and sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field
of light by far the greater part he took
transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed
in the suns orb made porous to receive
and drink the liquid light firm to retain
her gathered beams great palace now of light
hither as to their fountain other stars
repairing in their golden urns draw light
and hence the morningplanet gilds her horns
by tincture or reflection they augment
their small peculiar though from human sight
so far remote with diminution seen
first in his east the glorious lamp was seen
regent of day and all the horizon round
invested with bright rays jocund to run
his longitude through heavens high road the gray
dawn and the pleiades before him danced
shedding sweet influence less bright the moon
but opposite in levelled west was set
his mirrour with full face borrowing her light
from him for other light she needed none
in that aspect and still that distance keeps
till night then in the east her turn she shines
revolved on heavens great axle and her reign
with thousand lesser lights dividual holds
with thousand thousand stars that then appeared
spangling the hemisphere then first adorned
with their bright luminaries that set and rose
glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day
and god said let the waters generate
reptile with spawn abundant living soul
and let fowl fly above the earth with wings
displayed on the open firmament of heaven
and god created the great whales and each
soul living each that crept which plenteously
the waters generated by their kinds
and every bird of wing after his kind
and saw that it was good and blessed them saying
be fruitful multiply and in the seas
and lakes and running streams the waters fill
and let the fowl be multiplied on the earth
forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay
with fry innumerable swarm and shoals
of fish that with their fins and shining scales
glide under the green wave in sculls that oft
bank the mid sea part single or with mate
graze the seaweed their pasture and through groves
of coral stray or sporting with quick glance
show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold
or in their pearly shells at ease attend
moist nutriment or under rocks their food
in jointed armour watch on smooth the seal
and bended dolphins play part huge of bulk
wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait
tempest the ocean there leviathan
hugest of living creatures on the deep
stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims
and seems a moving land and at his gills
draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea
mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores
their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon
bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
their callow young but feathered soon and fledge
they summed their pens and soaring the air sublime
with clang despised the ground under a cloud
in prospect there the eagle and the stork
on cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build
part loosely wing the region part more wise
in common ranged in figure wedge their way
intelligent of seasons and set forth
their aery caravan high over seas
flying and over lands with mutual wing
easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
her annual voyage borne on winds the air
floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes
from branch to branch the smaller birds with song
solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
till even nor then the solemn nightingale
ceased warbling but all night tund her soft lays
others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
their downy breast the swan with arched neck
between her white wings mantling proudly rows
her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
the dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
the mid aereal sky others on ground
walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
the silent hours and the other whose gay train
adorns him coloured with the florid hue
of rainbows and starry eyes the waters thus
with fish replenished and the air with fowl
evening and morn solemnized the fifth day
the sixth and of creation last arose
with evening harps and matin when god said
let the earth bring forth soul living in her kind
cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth
each in their kind the earth obeyed and straight
opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
innumerous living creatures perfect forms
limbed and full grown out of the ground up rose
as from his lair the wild beast where he wons
in forest wild in thicket brake or den
among the trees in pairs they rose they walked
the cattle in the fields and meadows green
those rare and solitary these in flocks
pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung
the grassy clods now calved now half appeared
the tawny lion pawing to get free
his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds
and rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce
the libbard and the tiger as the mole
rising the crumbled earth above them threw
in hillocks the swift stag from under ground
bore up his branching head scarce from his mould
behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
his vastness fleeced the flocks and bleating rose
as plants ambiguous between sea and land
the riverhorse and scaly crocodile
at once came forth whatever creeps the ground
insect or worm those waved their limber fans
for wings and smallest lineaments exact
in all the liveries decked of summers pride
with spots of gold and purple azure and green
these as a line their long dimension drew
streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
minims of nature some of serpentkind
wonderous in length and corpulence involved
their snaky folds and added wings first crept
the parsimonious emmet provident
of future in small room large heart enclosed
pattern of just equality perhaps
hereafter joined in her popular tribes
of commonalty swarming next appeared
the female bee that feeds her husband drone
deliciously and builds her waxen cells
with honey stored the rest are numberless
and thou their natures knowest and gavest them names
needless to thee repeated nor unknown
the serpent subtlest beast of all the field
of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
and hairy mane terrifick though to thee
not noxious but obedient at thy call
now heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
her motions as the great first movers hand
first wheeled their course earth in her rich attire
consummate lovely smiled air water earth
by fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked
frequent and of the sixth day yet remained
there wanted yet the masterwork the end
of all yet done a creature who not prone
and brute as other creatures but endued
with sanctity of reason might erect
his stature and upright with front serene
govern the rest selfknowing and from thence
magnanimous to correspond with heaven
but grateful to acknowledge whence his good
descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
directed in devotion to adore
and worship god supreme who made him chief
of all his works therefore the omnipotent
eternal father  thus to his son audibly spake
let us make now man in our image man
in our similitude and let them rule
over the fish and fowl of sea and air
beast of the field and over all the earth
and every creeping thing that creeps the ground
this said he formed thee adam thee o man
dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
the breath of life in his own image he
created thee in the image of god
express and thou becamest a living soul
male he created thee but thy consort
female for race then blessed mankind and said
be fruitful multiply and fill the earth
subdue it and throughout dominion hold
over fish of the sea and fowl of the air
and every living thing that moves on the earth
wherever thus created for no place
is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest
he brought thee into this delicious grove
this garden planted with the trees of god
delectable both to behold and taste
and freely all their pleasant fruit for food
gave thee all sorts are here that all the earth yields
variety without end but of the tree
which tasted works knowledge of good and evil
thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest
death is the penalty imposed beware
and govern well thy appetite lest sin
surprise thee and her black attendant death
here finished he and all that he had made
viewed and behold all was entirely good
so even and morn accomplished the sixth day
yet not till the creator from his work
desisting though unwearied up returned
up to the heaven of heavens his high abode
thence to behold this new created world
the addition of his empire how it showed
in prospect from his throne how good how fair
answering his great idea up he rode
followed with acclamation and the sound
symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
angelick harmonies the earth the air
resounded 
the heavens and all the constellations rung
the planets in their station listening stood
while the bright pomp ascended jubilant
open ye everlasting gates they sung
open ye heavens your living doors let in
the great creator from his work returned
magnificent his six days work a world
open and henceforth oft for god will deign
to visit oft the dwellings of just men
delighted and with frequent intercourse
thither will send his winged messengers
on errands of supernal grace so sung
the glorious train ascending he through heaven
that opened wide her blazing portals led
to gods eternal house direct the way
a broad and ample road whose dust is gold
and pavement stars as stars to thee appear
seen in the galaxy that milky way
which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
powdered with stars and now on earth the seventh
evening arose in eden for the sun
was set and twilight from the east came on
forerunning night when at the holy mount
of heavens highseated top the imperial throne
of godhead fixed for ever firm and sure
the filial power arrived and sat him down
with his great father for he also went
invisible yet staid  and the work ordained
author and end of all things and from work
now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day
as resting on that day from all his work
but not in silence holy kept the harp
had work and rested not the solemn pipe
and dulcimer all organs of sweet stop
all sounds on fret by string or golden wire
tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
choral or unison of incense clouds
fuming from golden censers hid the mount
creation and the six days acts they sung
great are thy works jehovah infinite
thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
relate thee greater now in thy return
than from the giant angels thee that day
thy thunders magnified but to create
is greater than created to destroy
who can impair thee mighty king or bound
thy empire easily the proud attempt
of spirits apostate and their counsels vain
thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
the number of thy worshippers who seeks
to lessen thee against his purpose serves
to manifest the more thy might his evil
thou usest and from thence createst more good
witness this newmade world another heaven
from heavengate not far founded in view
on the clear hyaline the glassy sea
of amplitude almost immense with stars
numerous and every star perhaps a world
of destined habitation but thou knowest
their seasons among these the seat of men
earth with her nether ocean circumfused
their pleasant dwellingplace thrice happy men
and sons of men whom god hath thus advanced
created in his image there to dwell
and worship him and in reward to rule
over his works on earth in sea or air
and multiply a race of worshippers
holy and just thrice happy if they know
their happiness and persevere upright
so sung they and the empyrean rung
with halleluiahs thus was sabbath kept
and thy request think now fulfilled that asked
how first this world and face of things began
and what before thy memory was done
from the beginning that posterity
informed by thee might know if else thou seekest
aught not surpassing human measure say






the angel ended and in adams ear
so charming left his voice that he a while
thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
then as new waked thus gratefully replied
what thanks sufficient or what recompence
equal have i to render thee divine
historian who thus largely hast allayed
the thirst i had of knowledge and vouchsafed
this friendly condescension to relate
things else by me unsearchable now heard
with wonder but delight and as is due
with glory attributed to the high
creator something yet of doubt remains
which only thy solution can resolve
when i behold this goodly frame this world
of heaven and earth consisting and compute
their magnitudes this earth a spot a grain
an atom with the firmament compared
and all her numbered stars that seem to roll
spaces incomprehensible  merely to officiate light
round this opacous earth this punctual spot
one day and night in all her vast survey
useless besides reasoning i oft admire
how nature wise and frugal could commit
such disproportions with superfluous hand
so many nobler bodies to create
greater so manifold to this one use
for aught appears and on their orbs impose
such restless revolution day by day
repeated while the sedentary earth
that better might with far less compass move
served by more noble than herself attains
her end without least motion and receives
as tribute such a sumless journey brought
of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
so spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
entering on studious thoughts abstruse which eve
perceiving where she sat retired in sight
with lowliness majestick from her seat
and grace that won who saw to wish her stay
rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
to visit how they prospered bud and bloom
her nursery they at her coming sprung
and touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
yet went she not as not with such discourse
delighted or not capable her ear
of what was high such pleasure she reserved
adam relating she sole auditress
her husband the relater she preferred
before the angel and of him to ask
chose rather he she knew would intermix
grateful digressions and solve high dispute
with conjugal caresses from his lip
not words alone pleased her o when meet now
such pairs in love and mutual honour joined
with goddesslike demeanour forth she went
not unattended for on her as queen
a pomp of winning graces waited still
and from about her shot darts of desire
into all eyes to wish her still in sight
and raphael now to adams doubt proposed
benevolent and facile thus replied
to ask or search i blame thee not for heaven
is as the book of god before thee set
wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
his seasons hours or days or months or years
this to attain whether heaven move or earth
imports not if thou reckon right the rest
from man or angel the great architect
did wisely to conceal and not divulge
his secrets to be scanned by them who ought
rather admire or if they list to try
conjecture he his fabrick of the heavens
hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
his laughter at their quaint opinions wide
hereafter when they come to model heaven
and calculate the stars how they will wield
the mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
to save appearances how gird the sphere
with centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer
cycle and epicycle orb in orb
already by thy reasoning this i guess
who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
that bodies bright and greater should not serve
the less not bright nor heaven such journeys run
earth sitting still when she alone receives
the benefit consider first that great
or bright infers not excellence the earth
though in comparison of heaven so small
nor glistering may of solid good contain
more plenty than the sun that barren shines
whose virtue on itself works no effect
but in the fruitful earth there first received
his beams unactive else their vigour find
yet not to earth are those bright luminaries
officious but to thee earths habitant
and for the heavens wide circuit let it speak
the makers high magnificence who built
so spacious and his line stretched out so far
that man may know he dwells not in his own
an edifice too large for him to fill
lodged in a small partition and the rest
ordained for uses to his lord best known
the swiftness of those circles attribute
though numberless to his omnipotence
that to corporeal substances could add
speed almost spiritual me thou thinkest not slow
who since the morninghour set out from heaven
where god resides and ere midday arrived
in eden distance inexpressible
by numbers that have name but this i urge
admitting motion in the heavens to show
invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
not that i so affirm though so it seem
to thee who hast thy dwelling here on earth
god to remove his ways from human sense
placed heaven from earth so far that earthly sight
if it presume might err in things too high
and no advantage gain what if the sun
be center to the world and other stars
by his attractive virtue and their own
incited dance about him various rounds
their wandering course now high now low then hid
progressive retrograde or standing still
in six thou seest and what if seventh to these
the planet earth so stedfast though she seem
insensibly three different motions move
which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
moved contrary with thwart obliquities
or save the sun his labour and that swift
nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
invisible else above all stars the wheel
of day and night which needs not thy belief
if earth industrious of herself fetch day
travelling east and with her part averse
from the suns beam meet night her other part
still luminous by his ray what if that light
sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
to the terrestrial moon be as a star
enlightening her by day as she by night
this earth reciprocal if land be there
fields and inhabitants her spots thou seest
as clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
allotted there and other suns perhaps
with their attendant moons thou wilt descry
communicating male and female light
which two great sexes animate the world
stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
for such vast room in nature unpossessed
by living soul desart and desolate
only to shine yet scarce to contribute
each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
down to this habitable which returns
light back to them is obvious to dispute
but whether thus these things or whether not
but whether the sun predominant in heaven
rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
he from the east his flaming road begin
or she from west her silent course advance
with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
on her soft axle while she paces even
and bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
leave them to god above him serve and fear
of other creatures as him pleases best
wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
in what he gives to thee this paradise
and thy fair eve heaven is for thee too high
to know what passes there be lowly wise
think only what concerns thee and thy being
dream not of other worlds what creatures there
live in what state condition or degree
contented that thus far hath been revealed
not of earth only but of highest heaven
to whom thus adam cleared of doubt replied
how fully hast thou satisfied me pure
intelligence of heaven angel serene
and freed from intricacies taught to live
the easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
to interrupt the sweet of life from which
god hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
and not molest us unless we ourselves
seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
but apt the mind or fancy is to rove
unchecked and of her roving is no end
till warned or by experience taught she learn
that not to know at large of things remote
from use obscure and subtle but to know
that which before us lies in daily life
is the prime wisdom what is more is fume
or emptiness or fond impertinence
and renders us in things that most concern
unpractised unprepared and still to seek
therefore from this high pitch let us descend
a lower flight and speak of things at hand
useful whence haply mention may arise
of something not unseasonable to ask
by sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
thee i have heard relating what was done
ere my remembrance now hear me relate
my story which perhaps thou hast not heard
and day is not yet spent till then thou seest
how subtly to detain thee i devise
inviting thee to hear while i relate
fond were it not in hope of thy reply
for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven
and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
and hunger both from labour at the hour
of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill
though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety
to whom thus raphael answered heavenly meek
nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men
nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee
abundantly his gifts hath also poured
inward and outward both his image fair
speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
attends thee and each word each motion forms
nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth
than of our fellowservant and inquire
gladly into the ways of god with man
for god we see hath honoured thee and set
on man his equal love say therefore on
for i that day was absent as befel
bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
far on excursion toward the gates of hell
squared in full legion 
to see that none thence issued forth a spy
or enemy while god was in his work
lest he incensed at such eruption bold
destruction with creation might have mixed
not that they durst without his leave attempt
but us he sends upon his high behests
for state as sovran king and to inure
our prompt obedience fast we found fast shut
the dismal gates and barricadoed strong
but long ere our approaching heard within
noise other than the sound of dance or song
torment and loud lament and furious rage
glad we returned up to the coasts of light
ere sabbathevening so we had in charge
but thy relation now for i attend
pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine
so spake the godlike power and thus our sire
for man to tell how human life began
is hard for who himself beginning knew
desire with thee still longer to converse
induced me as new waked from soundest sleep
soft on the flowery herb i found me laid
in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed
straight toward heaven my wondering eyes i turned
and gazed a while the ample sky till raised
by quick instinctive motion up i sprung
as thitherward endeavouring and upright
stood on my feet about me round i saw
hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains
and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these
creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew
birds on the branches warbling all things smiled
with fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowed
myself i then perused and limb by limb
surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
with supple joints as lively vigour led
but who i was or where or from what cause
knew not to speak i tried and forthwith spake
my tongue obeyed and readily could name
whateer i saw thou sun said i fair light
and thou enlightened earth so fresh and gay
ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains
and ye that live and move fair creatures tell
tell if ye saw how i came thus how here
not of myselfby some great maker then
in goodness and in power preeminent
tell me how may i know him how adore
from whom i have that thus i move and live
and feel that i am happier than i know
while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither
from where i first drew air and first beheld
this happy light when answer none returned
on a green shady bank profuse of flowers
pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep
first found me and with soft oppression seised
my droused sense untroubled though i thought
i then was passing to my former state
insensible and forthwith to dissolve
when suddenly stood at my head a dream
whose inward apparition gently moved
my fancy to believe i yet had being
and lived one came methought of shape divine
and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise
first man of men innumerable ordained
first father called by thee i come thy guide
to the garden of bliss thy seat prepared
so saying by the hand he took me raised
and over fields and waters as in air
smoothsliding without step last led me up
a woody mountain whose high top was plain
a circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
planted with walks and bowers that what i saw
of earth before scarce pleasant seemed each tree
loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
to pluck and eat whereat i waked and found
before mine eyes all real as the dream
had lively shadowed here had new begun
my wandering had not he who was my guide
up hither from among the trees appeared
presence divine rejoicing but with awe
in adoration at his feet i fell
submiss he reared me and whom thou soughtest i am
said mildly author of all this thou seest
above or round about thee or beneath
this paradise i give thee count it thine
to till and keep and of the fruit to eat
of every tree that in the garden grows
eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth
but of the tree whose operation brings
knowledge of good and ill which i have set
the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith
amid the garden by the tree of life
remember what i warn thee shun to taste
and shun the bitter consequence for know
the day thou eatest thereof my sole command
transgressed inevitably thou shalt die
from that day mortal and this happy state
shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
of woe and sorrow sternly he pronounced
the rigid interdiction which resounds
yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
not to incur but soon his clear aspect
returned and gracious purpose thus renewed
not only these fair bounds but all the earth
to thee and to thy race i give as lords
possess it and all things that therein live
or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl
in sign whereof each bird and beast behold
after their kinds i bring them to receive
from thee their names and pay thee fealty
with low subjection understand the same
of fish within their watery residence
not hither summoned since they cannot change
their element to draw the thinner air
as thus he spake each bird and beast behold
approaching two and two these cowering low
with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing
i named them as they passed and understood
their nature with such knowledge god endued
my sudden apprehension but in these
i found not what methought i wanted still
and to the heavenly vision thus presumed
o by what name for thou above all these
above mankind or aught than mankind higher
surpassest far my naming how may i
adore thee author of this universe
and all this good to man for whose well being
so amply and with hands so liberal
thou hast provided all things but with me
i see not who partakes in solitude
what happiness who can enjoy alone
or all enjoying what contentment find
thus i presumptuous and the vision bright
as with a smile more brightened thus replied
what callest thou solitude is not the earth
with various living creatures and the air
replenished and all these at thy command
to come and play before thee knowest thou not
their language and their ways they also know
and reason not contemptibly with these
find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large
so spake the universal lord and seemed
so ordering i with leave of speech implored
and humble deprecation thus replied
let not my words offend thee heavenly power
my maker be propitious while i speak
hast thou not made me here thy substitute
and these inferiour far beneath me set
among unequals what society
can sort what harmony or true delight
which must be mutual in proportion due
given and received but in disparity
the one intense the other still remiss
cannot well suit with either but soon prove
tedious alike of fellowship i speak
such as i seek fit to participate
all rational delight wherein the brute
cannot be human consort they rejoice
each with their kind lion with lioness
so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined
much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
so well converse nor with the ox the ape
worse then can man with beast and least of all
whereto the almighty answered not displeased
a nice and subtle happiness i see
thou to thyself proposest in the choice
of thy associates adam and wilt taste
no pleasure though in pleasure solitary
what thinkest thou then of me and this my state
seem i to thee sufficiently possessed
of happiness or not who am alone
from all eternity for none i know
second to me or like equal much less
how have i then with whom to hold converse
save with the creatures which i made and those
to me inferiour infinite descents
beneath what other creatures are to thee
he ceased i lowly answered to attain
the highth and depth of thy eternal ways
all human thoughts come short supreme of things
thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
is no deficience found not so is man
but in degree the cause of his desire
by conversation with his like to help
or solace his defects no need that thou
shouldst propagate already infinite
and through all numbers absolute though one
but man by number is to manifest
his single imperfection and beget
like of his like his image multiplied
in unity defective which requires
collateral love and dearest amity
thou in thy secresy although alone
best with thyself accompanied seekest not
social communication yet so pleased
canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
of union or communion deified
i by conversing cannot these erect
from prone nor in their ways complacence find
thus i emboldened spake and freedom used
permissive and acceptance found which gained
this answer from the gracious voice divine
thus far to try thee adam i was pleased
and find thee knowing not of beasts alone
which thou hast rightly named but of thyself
expressing well the spirit within thee free
my image not imparted to the brute
whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike
and be so minded still i ere thou spakest
knew it not good for man to be alone
and no such company as then thou sawest
intended thee for trial only brought
to see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet
what next i bring shall please thee be assured
thy likeness thy fit help thy other self
thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire
he ended or i heard no more for now
my earthly by his heavenly overpowered
which it had long stood under strained to the highth
in that celestial colloquy sublime
as with an object that excels the sense
dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
of sleep which instantly fell on me called
by nature as in aid and closed mine eyes
mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
of fancy my internal sight by which
abstract as in a trance methought i saw
though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape
still glorious before whom awake i stood
who stooping opened my left side and took
from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm
and lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound
but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed
the rib he formed and fashioned with his hands
under his forming hands a creature grew
manlike but different sex so lovely fair
that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
mean or in her summed up in her contained
and in her looks which from that time infused
sweetness into my heart unfelt before
and into all things from her air inspired
the spirit of love and amorous delight
she disappeared and left me dark i waked
to find her or for ever to deplore
her loss and other pleasures all abjure
when out of hope behold her not far off
such as i saw her in my dream adorned
with what all earth or heaven could bestow
to make her amiable on she came
led by her heavenly maker though unseen
and guided by his voice nor uninformed
of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites
grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye
in every gesture dignity and love
i overjoyed could not forbear aloud
this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
thy words creator bounteous and benign
giver of all things fair but fairest this
of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see
bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
before me woman is her name of man
extracted for this cause he shall forego
father and mother and to his wife adhere
and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul
she heard me thus and though divinely brought
yet innocence and virgin modesty
her virtue and the conscience of her worth
that would be wooed and not unsought be won
not obvious not obtrusive but retired
the more desirable or to say all
nature herself though pure of sinful thought
wrought in her so that seeing me she turned
i followed her she what was honour knew
and with obsequious majesty approved
my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower
i led her blushing like the morn all heaven
and happy constellations on that hour
shed their selectest influence the earth
gave sign of gratulation and each hill
joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
whispered it to the woods and from their wings
flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub
disporting till the amorous bird of night
sung spousal and bid haste the eveningstar
on his hill top to light the bridal lamp
thus have i told thee all my state and brought
my story to the sum of earthly bliss
which i enjoy and must confess to find
in all things else delight indeed but such
as used or not works in the mind no change
nor vehement desire these delicacies
i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers
walks and the melody of birds but here
far otherwise transported i behold
transported touch here passion first i felt
commotion strange in all enjoyments else
superiour and unmoved here only weak
against the charm of beautys powerful glance
or nature failed in me and left some part
not proof enough such object to sustain
or from my side subducting took perhaps
more than enough at least on her bestowed
too much of ornament in outward show
elaborate of inward less exact
for well i understand in the prime end
of nature her the inferiour in the mind
and inward faculties which most excel
in outward also her resembling less
his image who made both and less expressing
the character of that dominion given
oer other creatures yet when i approach
her loveliness so absolute she seems
and in herself complete so well to know
her own that what she wills to do or say
seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best
all higher knowledge in her presence falls
degraded wisdom in discourse with her
loses discountenanced and like folly shows
authority and reason on her wait
as one intended first not after made
occasionally and to consummate all
greatness of mind and nobleness their seat
build in her loveliest and create an awe
about her as a guard angelick placed
to whom the angel with contracted brow
accuse not nature she hath done her part
do thou but thine and be not diffident
of wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh
by attributing overmuch to things
less excellent as thou thyself perceivest
for what admirest thou what transports thee so
an outside fair no doubt and worthy well
thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love
not thy subjection weigh with her thyself
then value ofttimes nothing profits more
than selfesteem grounded on just and right
well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
the more she will acknowledge thee her head
and to realities yield all her shows
made so adorn for thy delight the more
so awful that with honour thou mayest love
thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
but if the sense of touch whereby mankind
is propagated seem such dear delight
beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
to cattle and each beast which would not be
to them made common and divulged if aught
therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
the soul of man or passion in him move
what higher in her society thou findest
attractive human rational love still
in loving thou dost well in passion not
wherein true love consists not love refines
the thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
in reason and is judicious is the scale
by which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
among the beasts no mate for thee was found
to whom thus half abashed adam replied
neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
in procreation common to all kinds

so much delights me as those graceful acts
those thousand decencies that daily flow
from all her words and actions mixed with love
and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
union of mind or in us both one soul
harmony to behold in wedded pair
more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
yet these subject not i to thee disclose
what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled
who meet with various objects from the sense
variously representing yet still free
approve the best and follow what i approve
to love thou blamest me not for love thou sayest
leads up to heaven is both the way and guide
bear with me then if lawful what i ask
love not the heavenly spirits and how their love
express they by looks only or do they mix
irradiance virtual or immediate touch
to whom the angel with a smile that glowed
celestial rosy red loves proper hue
answered let it suffice thee that thou knowest
us happy and without love no happiness
whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
 we enjoy
in eminence and obstacle find none
of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
easier than air with air if spirits embrace
total they mix union of pure with pure
desiring nor restrained conveyance need
as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
but i can now no more the parting sun
beyond the earths green cape and verdant isles
hesperian sets my signal to depart
be strong live happy and love but first of all
him whom to love is to obey and keep
his great command take heed lest passion sway
thy judgement to do aught which else free will
would not admit thine and of all thy sons
the weal or woe in thee is placed beware
i in thy persevering shall rejoice
and all the blest stand fast to stand or fall
free in thine own arbitrement it lies
perfect within no outward aid require
and all temptation to transgress repel
so saying he arose whom adam thus
followed with benediction since to part
go heavenly guest ethereal messenger
sent from whose sovran goodness i adore
gentle to me and affable hath been
thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
with grateful memory thou to mankind
be good and friendly still and oft return
so parted they the angel up to heaven
from the thick shade and adam to his bower







no more of talk where god or angel guest
with man as with his friend familiar usd
to sit indulgent and with him partake
rural repast permitting him the while
venial discourse unblamd i now must change
those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
disloyal on the part of man revolt
and disobedience on the part of heaven
now alienated distance and distaste
anger and just rebuke and judgement given
that brought into this world a world of woe
sin and her shadow death and misery
deaths harbinger sad task yet argument
not less but more heroick than the wrath
of stern achilles on his foe pursued
thrice fugitive about troy wall or rage
of turnus for lavinia disespousd
or neptunes ire or junos that so long
perplexed the greek and cythereas son
if answerable style i can obtain
of my celestial patroness who deigns
her nightly visitation unimplord
and dictates to me slumbering or inspires
easy my unpremeditated verse
since first this subject for heroick song
pleasd me long choosing and beginning late
not sedulous by nature to indite
wars hitherto the only argument
heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect
with long and tedious havock fabled knights
in battles feignd the better fortitude
of patience and heroick martyrdom
unsung or to describe races and games
or tilting furniture imblazond shields
impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
at joust and tournament then marshalld feast
servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
the skill of artifice or office mean
not that which justly gives heroick name
to person or to poem me of these
nor skilld nor studious higher argument
remains sufficient of itself to raise
that name unless an age too late or cold
climate or years damp my intended wing
depressd and much they may if all be mine
not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
the sun was sunk and after him the star
of hesperus whose office is to bring
twilight upon the earth short arbiter
twixt day and night and now from end to end
nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round
when satan who late fled before the threats
of gabriel out of eden now improvd
in meditated fraud and malice bent
on mans destruction maugre what might hap
of heavier on himself fearless returned
by night he fled and at midnight returned
from compassing the earth cautious of day
since uriel regent of the sun descried
his entrance and foreworned the cherubim
that kept their watch thence full of anguish driven
the space of seven continued nights he rode
with darkness thrice the equinoctial line
he circled four times crossed the car of night
from pole to pole traversing each colure
on the eighth returned and on the coast averse
from entrance or cherubick watch by stealth
found unsuspected way there was a place
now not though sin not time first wrought the change
where tigris at the foot of paradise
into a gulf shot under ground till part
rose up a fountain by the tree of life
in with the river sunk and with it rose
satan involved in rising mist then sought
where to lie hid sea he had searched and land
from eden over pontus and the pool
maeotis up beyond the river ob
downward as far antarctick and in length
west from orontes to the ocean barred
at darien thence to the land where flows
ganges and indus thus the orb he roamed
with narrow search and with inspection deep
considered every creature which of all
most opportune might serve his wiles and found
the serpent subtlest beast of all the field
him after long debate irresolute
of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
to enter and his dark suggestions hide
from sharpest sight for in the wily snake
whatever sleights none would suspicious mark
as from his wit and native subtlety
proceeding which in other beasts observed
doubt might beget of diabolick power
active within beyond the sense of brute
thus he resolved but first from inward grief
his bursting passion into plaints thus poured
more justly seat worthier of gods as built
with second thoughts reforming what was old
o earth how like to heaven if not preferred
for what god after better worse would build
terrestrial heaven danced round by other heavens
that shine yet bear their bright officious lamps
light above light for thee alone as seems
in thee concentring all their precious beams
of sacred influence as god in heaven
is center yet extends to all so thou
centring receivest from all those orbs in thee
not in themselves all their known virtue appears
productive in herb plant and nobler birth
of creatures animate with gradual life
of growth sense reason all summed up in man
with what delight could i have walked thee round
if i could joy in aught sweet interchange
of hill and valley rivers woods and plains
now land now sea and shores with forest crowned
rocks dens and caves but i in none of these
find place or refuge and the more i see
pleasures about me so much more i feel
torment within me as from the hateful siege
of contraries all good to me becomes
bane and in heaven much worse would be my state
but neither here seek i no nor in heaven
to dwell unless by mastering heavens supreme
nor hope to be myself less miserable
by what i seek but others to make such
as i though thereby worse to me redound
for only in destroying i find ease
to my relentless thoughts and him destroyed
or won to what may work his utter loss
for whom all this was made all this will soon
follow as to him linked in weal or woe
in woe then that destruction wide may range
to me shall be the glory sole among
the infernal powers in one day to have marred
what he almighty styled six nights and days
continued making and who knows how long
before had been contriving though perhaps
not longer than since i in one night freed
from servitude inglorious well nigh half
the angelick name and thinner left the throng
of his adorers he to be avenged
and to repair his numbers thus impaired
whether such virtue spent of old now failed
more angels to create if they at least
are his created or to spite us more
determined to advance into our room
a creature formed of earth and him endow
exalted from so base original
with heavenly spoils our spoils what he decreed
he effected man he made and for him built
magnificent this world and earth his seat
him lord pronounced and o indignity
subjected to his service angelwings
and flaming ministers to watch and tend
their earthly charge of these the vigilance
i dread and to elude thus wrapt in mist
of midnight vapour glide obscure and pry
in every bush and brake where hap may find
the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
to hide me and the dark intent i bring
o foul descent that i who erst contended
with gods to sit the highest am now constrained
into a beast and mixed with bestial slime
this essence to incarnate and imbrute
that to the highth of deity aspired
but what will not ambition and revenge
descend to who aspires must down as low
as high he soared obnoxious first or last
to basest things revenge at first though sweet
bitter ere long back on itself recoils
let it i reck not so it light well aimed
since higher i fall short on him who next
provokes my envy this new favourite
of heaven this man of clay son of despite
whom us the more to spite his maker raised
from dust spite then with spite is best repaid
so saying through each thicket dank or dry
like a black mist lowcreeping he held on
his midnightsearch where soonest he might find
the serpent him fastsleeping soon he found
in labyrinth of many a round selfrolled
his head the midst well stored with subtile wiles
not yet in horrid shade or dismal den
nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb
fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth
the devil entered and his brutal sense
in heart or head possessing soon inspired
with act intelligential but his sleep
disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn
now when as sacred light began to dawn
in eden on the humid flowers that breathed
their morning incense when all things that breathe
from the earths great altar send up silent praise
to the creator and his nostrils fill
with grateful smell forth came the human pair
and joined their vocal worship to the quire
of creatures wanting voice that done partake
the season prime for sweetest scents and airs
then commune how that day they best may ply
their growing work for much their work outgrew
the hands dispatch of two gardening so wide
and eve first to her husband thus began
adam well may we labour still to dress
this garden still to tend plant herb and flower
our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
aid us the work under our labour grows
luxurious by restraint what we by day
lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind
one night or two with wanton growth derides
tending to wild thou therefore now advise
or bear what to my mind first thoughts present
let us divide our labours thou where choice
leads thee or where most needs whether to wind
the woodbine round this arbour or direct
the clasping ivy where to climb while i
in yonder spring of roses intermixed
with myrtle find what to redress till noon
for while so near each other thus all day
our task we choose what wonder if so near
looks intervene and smiles or object new
casual discourse draw on which intermits
our days work brought to little though begun
early and the hour of supper comes unearned
to whom mild answer adam thus returned
sole eve associate sole to me beyond
compare above all living creatures dear
well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed
how we might best fulfil the work which here
god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass
unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found
in woman than to study houshold good
and good works in her husband to promote
yet not so strictly hath our lord imposed
labour as to debar us when we need
refreshment whether food or talk between
food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow
to brute denied and are of love the food
love not the lowest end of human life
for not to irksome toil but to delight
he made us and delight to reason joined
these paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
as we need walk till younger hands ere long
assist us but if much converse perhaps
thee satiate to short absence i could yield
for solitude sometimes is best society
and short retirement urges sweet return
but other doubt possesses me lest harm
befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
what hath been warned us what malicious foe
envying our happiness and of his own
despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
by sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
his wish and best advantage us asunder
hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
to other speedy aid might lend at need
whether his first design be to withdraw
our fealty from god or to disturb
conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
enjoyed by us excites his envy more
or this or worse leave not the faithful side
that gave thee being still shades thee and protects
the wife where danger or dishonour lurks
safest and seemliest by her husband stays
who guards her or with her the worst endures
to whom the virgin majesty of eve
as one who loves and some unkindness meets
with sweet austere composure thus replied
offspring of heaven and earth and all earths lord
that such an enemy we have who seeks
our ruin both by thee informed i learn
and from the parting angel overheard
as in a shady nook i stood behind
just then returned at shut of evening flowers
but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
to god or thee because we have a foe
may tempt it i expected not to hear
his violence thou fearest not being such
as we not capable of death or pain
can either not receive or can repel
his fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
can by his fraud be shaken or seduced
thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast
adam misthought of her to thee so dear
to whom with healing words adam replied
daughter of god and man immortal eve
for such thou art from sin and blame entire
not diffident of thee do i dissuade
thy absence from my sight but to avoid
the attempt itself intended by our foe
for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
the tempted with dishonour foul supposed
not incorruptible of faith not proof
against temptation thou thyself with scorn
and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong
though ineffectual found misdeem not then
if such affront i labour to avert
from thee alone which on us both at once
the enemy though bold will hardly dare
or daring first on me the assault shall light
nor thou his malice and false guile contemn
subtle he needs must be who could seduce
angels nor think superfluous others aid
i from the influence of thy looks receive
access in every virtue in thy sight
more wise more watchful stronger if need were
of outward strength while shame thou looking on
shame to be overcome or overreached
would utmost vigour raise and raised unite
why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
when i am present and thy trial choose
with me best witness of thy virtue tried
so spake domestick adam in his care
and matrimonial love but eve who thought
less attributed to her faith sincere
thus her reply with accent sweet renewed
if this be our condition thus to dwell
in narrow circuit straitened by a foe
subtle or violent we not endued
single with like defence wherever met
how are we happy still in fear of harm
but harm precedes not sin only our foe
tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
of our integrity his foul esteem
sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
by us who rather double honour gain
from his surmise proved false find peace within
favour from heaven our witness from the event
and what is faith love virtue unassayed
alone without exteriour help sustained
let us not then suspect our happy state
left so imperfect by the maker wise
as not secure to single or combined
frail is our happiness if this be so
and eden were no eden thus exposed
to whom thus adam fervently replied
o woman best are all things as the will
of god ordained them his creating hand
nothing imperfect or deficient left
of all that he created much less man
or aught that might his happy state secure
secure from outward force within himself
the danger lies yet lies within his power
against his will he can receive no harm
but god left free the will for what obeys
reason is free and reason he made right
but bid her well be ware and still erect
lest by some fairappearing good surprised
she dictate false and misinform the will
to do what god expressly hath forbid
not then mistrust but tender love enjoins
that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me
firm we subsist yet possible to swerve
since reason not impossibly may meet
some specious object by the foe suborned
and fall into deception unaware
not keeping strictest watch as she was warned
seek not temptation then which to avoid
were better and most likely if from me
thou sever not trial will come unsought
wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
first thy obedience the other who can know
not seeing thee attempted who attest
but if thou think trial unsought may find
us both securer than thus warned thou seemest
go for thy stay not free absents thee more
go in thy native innocence rely
on what thou hast of virtue summon all
for god towards thee hath done his part do thine
so spake the patriarch of mankind but eve
persisted yet submiss though last replied
with thy permission then and thus forewarned
chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
touched only that our trial when least sought
may find us both perhaps far less prepared
the willinger i go nor much expect
a foe so proud will first the weaker seek
so bent the more shall shame him his repulse
thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
soft she withdrew and like a woodnymph light
oread or dryad or of delias train
betook her to the groves but delias self
in gait surpassed and goddesslike deport
though not as she with bow and quiver armed
but with such gardening tools as art yet rude
guiltless of fire had formed or angels brought
to pales or pomona thus adorned
likest she seemed pomona when she fled
vertumnus or to ceres in her prime
yet virgin of proserpina from jove
her long with ardent look his eye pursued
delighted but desiring more her stay
oft he to her his charge of quick return
repeated she to him as oft engaged
to be returned by noon amid the bower
and all things in best order to invite
noontide repast or afternoons repose
o much deceived much failing hapless eve
of thy presumed return event perverse
thou never from that hour in paradise
foundst either sweet repast or sound repose
such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades
waited with hellish rancour imminent
to intercept thy way or send thee back
despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss
for now and since first break of dawn the fiend
mere serpent in appearance forth was come
and on his quest where likeliest he might find
the only two of mankind but in them
the whole included race his purposed prey
in bower and field he sought where any tuft
of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay
their tendance or plantation for delight
by fountain or by shady rivulet
he sought them both but wished his hap might find
eve separate he wished but not with hope
of what so seldom chanced when to his wish
beyond his hope eve separate he spies
veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood
half spied so thick the roses blushing round
about her glowed oft stooping to support
each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
carnation purple azure or specked with gold
hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
gently with myrtle band mindless the while
herself though fairest unsupported flower
from her best prop so far and storm so nigh
nearer he drew and many a walk traversed
of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm
then voluble and bold now hid now seen
among thickwoven arborets and flowers
imbordered on each bank the hand of eve
spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
or of revived adonis or renowned
alcinous host of old laertes son
or that not mystick where the sapient king
held dalliance with his fair egyptian spouse
much he the place admired the person more
as one who long in populous city pent
where houses thick and sewers annoy the air
forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe
among the pleasant villages and farms
adjoined from each thing met conceives delight
the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine
or dairy each rural sight each rural sound
if chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass
what pleasing seemed for her now pleases more
she most and in her look sums all delight
such pleasure took the serpent to behold
this flowery plat the sweet recess of eve
thus early thus alone her heavenly form
angelick but more soft and feminine
her graceful innocence her every air
of gesture or least action overawed
his malice and with rapine sweet bereaved
his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought
that space the evilone abstracted stood
from his own evil and for the time remained
stupidly good of enmity disarmed
of guile of hate of envy of revenge
but the hot hell that always in him burns
though in mid heaven soon ended his delight
and tortures him now more the more he sees
of pleasure not for him ordained then soon
fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts
of mischief gratulating thus excites
thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet
compulsion thus transported to forget
what hither brought us hate not love nor hope
of paradise for hell hope here to taste
of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy
save what is in destroying other joy
to me is lost then let me not let pass
occasion which now smiles behold alone
the woman opportune to all attempts
her husband for i view far round not nigh
whose higher intellectual more i shun
and strength of courage haughty and of limb
heroick built though of terrestrial mould
foe not informidable exempt from wound
i not so much hath hell debased and pain
enfeebled me to what i was in heaven
she fair divinely fair fit love for gods
not terrible though terrour be in love
and beauty not approached by stronger hate
hate stronger under show of love well feigned
the way which to her ruin now i tend
so spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
in serpent inmate bad and toward eve
addressed his way not with indented wave
prone on the ground as since but on his rear
circular base of rising folds that towered
fold above fold a surging maze his head
crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes
with burnished neck of verdant gold erect
amidst his circling spires that on the grass
floated redundant pleasing was his shape
and lovely never since of serpentkind
lovelier not those that in illyria changed
hermione and cadmus or the god
in epidaurus nor to which transformed
ammonian jove or capitoline was seen
he with olympias this with her who bore
scipio the highth of rome with tract oblique
at first as one who sought access but feared
to interrupt sidelong he works his way
as when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
nigh rivers mouth or foreland where the wind
veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail
so varied he and of his tortuous train
curled many a wanton wreath in sight of eve
to lure her eye she busied heard the sound
of rusling leaves but minded not as used
to such disport before her through the field
from every beast more duteous at her call
than at circean call the herd disguised
he bolder now uncalled before her stood
but as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
his turret crest and sleek enamelled neck
fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod
his gentle dumb expression turned at length
the eye of eve to mark his play he glad
of her attention gained with serpenttongue
organick or impulse of vocal air
his fraudulent temptation thus began
wonder not sovran mistress if perhaps
thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
thy looks the heaven of mildness with disdain
displeased that i approach thee thus and gaze
insatiate i thus single nor have feared
thy awful brow more awful thus retired
fairest resemblance of thy maker fair
thee all things living gaze on all things thine
by gift and thy celestial beauty adore
with ravishment beheld there best beheld
where universally admired but here
in this enclosure wild these beasts among
beholders rude and shallow to discern
half what in thee is fair one man except
who sees thee and what is one who should be seen
a goddess among gods adored and served
by angels numberless thy daily train
so glozed the tempter and his proem tuned
into the heart of eve his words made way
though at the voice much marvelling at length
not unamazed she thus in answer spake
what may this mean language of man pronounced
by tongue of brute and human sense expressed
the first at least of these i thought denied
to beasts whom god on their creationday
created mute to all articulate sound
the latter i demur for in their looks
much reason and in their actions oft appears
thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field
i knew but not with human voice endued
redouble then this miracle and say
how camest thou speakable of mute and how
to me so friendly grown above the rest
of brutal kind that daily are in sight
say for such wonder claims attention due
to whom the guileful tempter thus replied
empress of this fair world resplendent eve
easy to me it is to tell thee all
what thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed
i was at first as other beasts that graze
the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low
as was my food nor aught but food discerned
or sex and apprehended nothing high
till on a day roving the field i chanced
a goodly tree far distant to behold
loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed
ruddy and gold i nearer drew to gaze
when from the boughs a savoury odour blown
grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even
unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play
to satisfy the sharp desire i had
of tasting those fair apples i resolved
not to defer hunger and thirst at once
powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
of that alluring fruit urged me so keen
about the mossy trunk i wound me soon
for high from ground the branches would require
thy utmost reach or adams round the tree
all other beasts that saw with like desire
longing and envying stood but could not reach
amid the tree now got where plenty hung
tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
i spared not for such pleasure till that hour
at feed or fountain never had i found
sated at length ere long i might perceive
strange alteration in me to degree
of reason in my inward powers and speech
wanted not long though to this shape retained
thenceforth to speculations high or deep
i turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
considered all things visible in heaven
or earth or middle all things fair and good
but all that fair and good in thy divine
semblance and in thy beautys heavenly ray
united i beheld no fair to thine
equivalent or second which compelled
me thus though importune perhaps to come
and gaze and worship thee of right declared
sovran of creatures universal dame
so talked the spirited sly snake and eve
yet more amazed unwary thus replied
serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
but say where grows the tree from hence how far
for many are the trees of god that grow
in paradise and various yet unknown
to us in such abundance lies our choice
as leaves a greater store of fruit untouched
still hanging incorruptible till men
grow up to their provision and more hands
help to disburden nature of her birth
to whom the wily adder blithe and glad
empress the way is ready and not long
beyond a row of myrtles on a flat
fast by a fountain one small thicket past
of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
my conduct i can bring thee thither soon
lead then said eve he leading swiftly rolled
in tangles and made intricate seem straight
to mischief swift hope elevates and joy
brightens his crest as when a wandering fire
compact of unctuous vapour which the night
condenses and the cold environs round
kindled through agitation to a flame
which oft they say some evil spirit attends
hovering and blazing with delusive light
misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way
to bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
there swallowed up and lost from succour far
so glistered the dire snake and into fraud
led eve our credulous mother to the tree
of prohibition root of all our woe
which when she saw thus to her guide she spake
serpent we might have spared our coming hither
fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
the credit of whose virtue rest with thee
wonderous indeed if cause of such effects
but of this tree we may not taste nor touch
god so commanded and left that command
sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
law to ourselves our reason is our law
to whom the tempter guilefully replied
indeed hath god then said that of the fruit
of all these gardentrees ye shall not eat
yet lords declared of all in earth or air
to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit
of each tree in the garden we may eat
but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
the garden god hath said ye shall not eat
thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
she scarce had said though brief when now more bold
the tempter but with show of zeal and love
to man and indignation at his wrong
new part puts on and as to passion moved
fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
raised as of some great matter to begin
as when of old some orator renowned
in athens or free rome where eloquence
flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
stood in himself collected while each part
motion each act won audience ere the tongue
sometimes in highth began as no delay
of preface brooking through his zeal of right
so standing moving or to highth up grown
the tempter all impassioned thus began
o sacred wise and wisdomgiving plant
mother of science now i feel thy power
within me clear not only to discern
things in their causes but to trace the ways
of highest agents deemed however wise
queen of this universe do not believe
those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
how should you by the fruit it gives you life
to knowledge by the threatener look on me
me who have touched and tasted yet both live
and life more perfect have attained than fate
meant me by venturing higher than my lot
shall that be shut to man which to the beast
is open or will god incense his ire
for such a petty trespass and not praise
rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
of death denounced whatever thing death be
deterred not from achieving what might lead
to happier life knowledge of good and evil
of good how just of evil if what is evil
be real why not known since easier shunned
god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
not just not god not feared then nor obeyed
your fear itself of death removes the fear
why then was this forbid why but to awe
why but to keep ye low and ignorant
his worshippers he knows that in the day
ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
opened and cleared and ye shall be as gods
knowing both good and evil as they know
that ye shall be as gods since i as man
internal man is but proportion meet
i of brute human ye of human gods
so ye shall die perhaps by putting off
human to put on gods death to be wished
though threatened which no worse than this can bring
and what are gods that man may not become
as they participating godlike food
the gods are first and that advantage use
on our belief that all from them proceeds
i question it for this fair earth i see
warmed by the sun producing every kind
them nothing if they all things who enclosed
knowledge of good and evil in this tree
that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
the offence that man should thus attain to know
what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
impart against his will if all be his
or is it envy and can envy dwell
in heavenly breasts these these and many more
causes import your need of this fair fruit
goddess humane reach then and freely taste
he ended and his words replete with guile
into her heart too easy entrance won
fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
with reason to her seeming and with truth
mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
an eager appetite raised by the smell
so savoury of that fruit which with desire
inclinable now grown to touch or taste
solicited her longing eye yet first
pausing a while thus to herself she mused
great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
though kept from man and worthy to be admired
whose taste too long forborn at first assay
gave elocution to the mute and taught
the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
thy praise he also who forbids thy use
conceals not from us naming thee the tree
of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
commends thee more while it infers the good
by thee communicated and our want
for good unknown sure is not had or had
and yet unknown is as not had at all
in plain then what forbids he but to know
forbids us good forbids us to be wise
such prohibitions bind not but if death
bind us with afterbands what profits then
our inward freedom in the day we eat
of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
how dies the serpent he hath eaten and lives
and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
irrational till then for us alone
was death invented or to us denied
this intellectual food for beasts reserved
for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
the good befallen him author unsuspect
friendly to man far from deceit or guile
what fear i then rather what know to fear
under this ignorance of good and evil
of god or death of law or penalty
here grows the cure of all this fruit divine
fair to the eye inviting to the taste
of virtue to make wise what hinders then
to reach and feed at once both body and mind
so saying her rash hand in evil hour
forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat
earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
sighing through all her works gave signs of woe
that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
the guilty serpent and well might for eve
intent now wholly on her taste nought else
regarded such delight till then as seemed
in fruit she never tasted whether true
or fancied so through expectation high
of knowledge not was godhead from her thought
greedily she ingorged without restraint
and knew not eating death satiate at length
and hightened as with wine jocund and boon
thus to herself she pleasingly began
o sovran virtuous precious of all trees
in paradise of operation blest
to sapience hitherto obscured infamed
and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
created but henceforth my early care
not without song each morning and due praise
shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
of thy full branches offered free to all
till dieted by thee i grow mature
in knowledge as the gods who all things know
though others envy what they cannot give
for had the gift been theirs it had not here
thus grown experience next to thee i owe
best guide not following thee i had remained
in ignorance thou openest wisdoms way
and givest access though secret she retire
and i perhaps am secret heaven is high
high and remote to see from thence distinct
each thing on earth and other care perhaps
may have diverted from continual watch
our great forbidder safe with all his spies
about him but to adam in what sort
shall i appear shall i to him make known
as yet my change and give him to partake
full happiness with me or rather not
but keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
without copartner so to add what wants
in female sex the more to draw his love
and render me more equal and perhaps
a thing not undesirable sometime
superiour for inferiour who is free
this may be well but what if god have seen
and death ensue then i shall be no more
and adam wedded to another eve
shall live with her enjoying i extinct
a death to think confirmed then i resolve
adam shall share with me in bliss or woe
so dear i love him that with him all deaths
i could endure without him live no life
so saying from the tree her step she turned
but first low reverence done as to the power
that dwelt within whose presence had infused
into the plant sciential sap derived
from nectar drink of gods adam the while
waiting desirous her return had wove
of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
her tresses and her rural labours crown
as reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen
great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
solace in her return so long delayed
yet oft his heart divine of something ill
misgave him he the faltering measure felt
and forth to meet her went the way she took
that morn when first they parted by the tree
of knowledge he must pass there he her met
scarce from the tree returning in her hand
a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled
new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused
to him she hasted in her face excuse
came prologue and apology too prompt
which with bland words at will she thus addressed
hast thou not wondered adam at my stay
thee i have missed and thought it long deprived
thy presence agony of love till now
not felt nor shall be twice for never more
mean i to try what rash untried i sought
the pain of absence from thy sight but strange
hath been the cause and wonderful to hear
this tree is not as we are told a tree
of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
opening the way but of divine effect
to open eyes and make them gods who taste
and hath been tasted such the serpent wise
or not restrained as we or not obeying
hath eaten of the fruit and is become
not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth
endued with human voice and human sense
reasoning to admiration and with me
persuasively hath so prevailed that i
have also tasted and have also found
the effects to correspond opener mine eyes
dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart
and growing up to godhead which for thee
chiefly i sought without thee can despise
for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss
tedious unshared with thee and odious soon
thou therefore also taste that equal lot
may join us equal joy as equal love
lest thou not tasting different degree
disjoin us and i then too late renounce
deity for thee when fate will not permit
thus eve with countenance blithe her story told
but in her cheek distemper flushing glowed
on the other side adam soon as he heard
the fatal trespass done by eve amazed
astonied stood and blank while horrour chill
ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed
from his slack hand the garland wreathed for eve
down dropt and all the faded roses shed
speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
first to himself he inward silence broke
o fairest of creation last and best
of all gods works creature in whom excelled
whatever can to sight or thought be formed
holy divine good amiable or sweet
how art thou lost how on a sudden lost
defaced deflowered and now to death devote
rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
the strict forbiddance how to violate
the sacred fruit forbidden some cursed fraud
of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
and me with thee hath ruined for with thee
certain my resolution is to die
how can i live without thee how forego
thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
to live again in these wild woods forlorn
should god create another eve and i
another rib afford yet loss of thee
would never from my heart no no i feel
the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh
bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
so having said as one from sad dismay
recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
submitting to what seemed remediless
thus in calm mood his words to eve he turned
bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous eve
and peril great provoked who thus hast dared
had it been only coveting to eye
that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
much more to taste it under ban to touch
but past who can recall or done undo
not god omnipotent nor fate yet so
perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
profaned first by the serpent by him first
made common and unhallowed ere our taste
nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
lives as thou saidst and gains to live as man
higher degree of life inducement strong
to us as likely tasting to attain
proportional ascent which cannot be
but to be gods or angels demigods
nor can i think that god creator wise
though threatening will in earnest so destroy
us his prime creatures dignified so high
set over all his works which in our fall
for us created needs with us must fail
dependant made so god shall uncreate
be frustrate do undo and labour lose
not well conceived of god who though his power
creation could repeat yet would be loth
us to abolish lest the adversary
triumph and say fickle their state whom god
most favours who can please him long me first
he ruined now mankind whom will he next
matter of scorn not to be given the foe
however i with thee have fixed my lot
certain to undergo like doom if death
consort with thee death is to me as life
so forcible within my heart i feel
the bond of nature draw me to my own
my own in thee for what thou art is mine
our state cannot be severed we are one
one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
so adam and thus eve to him replied
o glorious trial of exceeding love
illustrious evidence example high
engaging me to emulate but short
of thy perfection how shall i attain
adam from whose dear side i boast me sprung
and gladly of our union hear thee speak
one heart one soul in both whereof good proof
this day affords declaring thee resolved
rather than death or aught than death more dread
shall separate us linked in love so dear
to undergo with me one guilt one crime
if any be of tasting this fair fruit
whose virtue for of good still good proceeds
direct or by occasion hath presented
this happy trial of thy love which else
so eminently never had been known
were it i thought death menaced would ensue
this my attempt i would sustain alone
the worst and not persuade thee rather die
deserted than oblige thee with a fact
pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
remarkably so late of thy so true
so faithful love unequalled but i feel
far otherwise the event not death but life
augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys
taste so divine that what of sweet before
hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh
on my experience adam freely taste
and fear of death deliver to the winds
so saying she embraced him and for joy
tenderly wept much won that he his love
had so ennobled as of choice to incur
divine displeasure for her sake or death
in recompence  from the bough
she gave him of that fair enticing fruit
with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
against his better knowledge not deceived
but fondly overcome with female charm
earth trembled from her entrails as again
in pangs and nature gave a second groan
sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
wept at completing of the mortal sin
original while adam took no thought
eating his fill nor eve to iterate
her former trespass feared the more to sooth
him with her loved society that now
as with new wine intoxicated both
they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
divinity within them breeding wings
wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit
far other operation first displayed
carnal desire inflaming he on eve
began to cast lascivious eyes she him
as wantonly repaid in lust they burn
till adam thus gan eve to dalliance move
eve now i see thou art exact of taste
and elegant of sapience no small part
since to each meaning savour we apply
and palate call judicious i the praise
yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
from this delightful fruit nor known till now
true relish tasting if such pleasure be
in things to us forbidden it might be wished
for this one tree had been forbidden ten
but come so well refreshed now let us play
as meet is after such delicious fare
for never did thy beauty since the day
i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
with all perfections so inflame my sense
with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
than ever bounty of this virtuous tree
so said he and forbore not glance or toy
of amorous intent well understood
of eve whose eye darted contagious fire
her hand he seised and to a shady bank
thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered
he led her nothing loth flowers were the couch
pansies and violets and asphodel
and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap
there they their fill of love and loves disport
took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
the solace of their sin till dewy sleep
oppressed them wearied with their amorous play
soon as the force of that fallacious fruit
that with exhilarating vapour bland
about their spirits had played and inmost powers
made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep
bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
incumbered now had left them up they rose
as from unrest and each the other viewing
soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
how darkened innocence that as a veil
had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone
just confidence and native righteousness
and honour from about them naked left
to guilty shame he covered but his robe
uncovered more so rose the danite strong
herculean samson from the harlotlap
of philistean dalilah and waked
shorn of his strength they destitute and bare
of all their virtue silent and in face
confounded long they sat as strucken mute
till adam though not less than eve abashed
at length gave utterance to these words constrained
o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
to that false worm of whomsoever taught
to counterfeit mans voice true in our fall
false in our promised rising since our eyes
opened we find indeed and find we know
both good and evil good lost and evil got
bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know
which leaves us naked thus of honour void
of innocence of faith of purity
our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained
and in our faces evident the signs
of foul concupiscence whence evil store
even shame the last of evils of the first
be sure thenhow shall i behold the face
henceforth of god or angel erst with joy
and rapture so oft beheld those heavenly shapes
will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
insufferably bright o might i here
in solitude live savage in some glade
obscured where highest woods impenetrable
to star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad
and brown as evening cover me ye pines
ye cedars with innumerable boughs
hide me where i may never see them more
but let us now as in bad plight devise
what best may for the present serve to hide
the parts of each from other that seem most
to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen
some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed
and girded on our loins may cover round
those middle parts that this new comer shame
there sit not and reproach us as unclean
so counselled he and both together went
into the thickest wood there soon they chose
the figtree not that kind for fruit renowned
but such as at this day to indians known
in malabar or decan spreads her arms
branching so broad and long that in the ground
the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
about the mother tree a pillared shade
high overarched and echoing walks between
there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat
shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves
they gathered broad as amazonian targe
and with what skill they had together sewed
to gird their waist vain covering if to hide
their guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike
to that first naked glory such of late
columbus found the american so girt
with feathered cincture naked else and wild
among the trees on isles and woody shores
thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
covered but not at rest or ease of mind
they sat them down to weep nor only tears
rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
began to rise high passions anger hate
mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
their inward state of mind calm region once
and full of peace now tost and turbulent
for understanding ruled not and the will
heard not her lore both in subjection now
to sensual appetite who from beneath
usurping over sovran reason claimed
superiour sway from thus distempered breast
adam estranged in look and altered style
speech intermitted thus to eve renewed
would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
with me as i besought thee when that strange
desire of wandering this unhappy morn
i know not whence possessed thee we had then
remained still happy not as now despoiled
of all our good shamed naked miserable
let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
the faith they owe when earnestly they seek
such proof conclude they then begin to fail
to whom soon moved with touch of blame thus eve
what words have passed thy lips adam severe
imputest thou that to my default or will
of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
but might as ill have happened thou being by
or to thyself perhaps hadst thou been there
or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
fraud in the serpent speaking as he spake
no ground of enmity between us known
why he should mean me ill or seek to harm
was i to have never parted from thy side
as good have grown there still a lifeless rib
being as i am why didst not thou the head
command me absolutely not to go
going into such danger as thou saidst
too facile then thou didst not much gainsay
nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss
hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent
neither had i transgressed nor thou with me
to whom then first incensed adam replied
is this the love is this the recompence
of mine to thee ingrateful eve expressed
immutable when thou wert lost not i
who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss
yet willingly chose rather death with thee
and am i now upbraided as the cause
of thy transgressing not enough severe
it seems in thy restraint what could i more
i warned thee i admonished thee foretold
the danger and the lurking enemy
that lay in wait beyond this had been force
and force upon free will hath here no place
but confidence then bore thee on secure
either to meet no danger or to find
matter of glorious trial and perhaps
i also erred in overmuch admiring
what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought
no evil durst attempt thee but i rue
the errour now which is become my crime
and thou the accuser thus it shall befall
him who to worth in women overtrusting
lets her will rule restraint she will not brook
and left to herself if evil thence ensue
she first his weak indulgence will accuse
thus they in mutual accusation spent
the fruitless hours but neither selfcondemning
and of their vain contest appeared no end







mean while the heinous and despiteful act
of satan done in paradise and how
he in the serpent had perverted eve
her husband she to taste the fatal fruit
was known in heaven for what can scape the eye
of god allseeing or deceive his heart
omniscient who in all things wise and just
hindered not satan to attempt the mind
of man with strength entire and free will armed
complete to have discovered and repulsed
whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend
for still they knew and ought to have still remembered
the high injunction not to taste that fruit
whoever tempted which they not obeying
 the penalty
and manifold in sin deserved to fall
up into heaven from paradise in haste
the angelick guards ascended mute and sad
for man for of his state by this they knew
much wondering how the subtle fiend had stolen
entrance unseen soon as the unwelcome news
from earth arrived at heavengate displeased
all were who heard dim sadness did not spare
that time celestial visages yet mixed
with pity violated not their bliss
about the newarrived in multitudes
the ethereal people ran to hear and know
how all befel they towards the throne supreme
accountable made haste to make appear
with righteous plea their utmost vigilance
and easily approved when the most high
eternal father from his secret cloud
amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice
assembled angels and ye powers returned
from unsuccessful charge be not dismayed
nor troubled at these tidings from the earth
which your sincerest care could not prevent
foretold so lately what would come to pass
when first this tempter crossed the gulf from hell
i told ye then he should prevail and speed
on his bad errand man should be seduced
and flattered out of all believing lies
against his maker no decree of mine
concurring to necessitate his fall
or touch with lightest moment of impulse
his free will to her own inclining left
in even scale but fallen he is and now
what rests but that the mortal sentence pass
on his transgressiondeath denounced that day
which he presumes already vain and void
because not yet inflicted as he feared
by some immediate stroke but soon shall find
forbearance no acquittance ere day end
justice shall not return as bounty scorned
but whom send i to judge them whom but thee
vicegerent son to thee i have transferred
all judgement whether in heaven or earth or hell
easy it may be seen that i intend
mercy colleague with justice sending thee
mans friend his mediator his designed
both ransom and redeemer voluntary
and destined man himself to judge man fallen
so spake the father and unfolding bright
toward the right hand his glory on the son
blazed forth unclouded deity he full
resplendent all his father manifest
expressed and thus divinely answered mild
father eternal thine is to decree
mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will
supreme that thou in me thy son beloved
mayest ever rest well pleased i go to judge
on earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest
whoever judged the worst on me must light
when time shall be for so i undertook
before thee and not repenting this obtain
of right that i may mitigate their doom
on me derived yet i shall temper so
justice with mercy as may illustrate most
them fully satisfied and thee appease
attendance none shall need nor train where none
are to behold the judgement but the judged
those two the third best absent is condemned
convict by flight and rebel to all law
conviction to the serpent none belongs
thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
of high collateral glory him thrones and powers
princedoms and dominations ministrant
accompanied to heavengate from whence
eden and all the coast in prospect lay
down he descended straight the speed of gods
time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged
now was the sun in western cadence low
from noon and gentle airs due at their hour
to fan the earth now waked and usher in
the evening cool when he from wrath more cool
came the mild judge and intercessour both
to sentence man the voice of god they heard
now walking in the garden by soft winds
brought to their ears while day declined they heard
and from his presence hid themselves among
the thickest trees both man and wife till god
approaching thus to adam called aloud
where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
my coming seen far off i miss thee here
not pleased thus entertained with solitude
where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought
or come i less conspicuous or what change
absents thee or what chance detainscome forth
he came and with him eve more loth though first
to offend discountenanced both and discomposed
love was not in their looks either to god
or to each other but apparent guilt
and shame and perturbation and despair
anger and obstinacy and hate and guile
whence adam faltering long thus answered brief
i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
afraid being naked hid myself to whom
the gracious judge without revile replied
my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared
but still rejoiced how is it now become
so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree
whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat
to whom thus adam sore beset replied
o heaven in evil strait this day i stand
before my judge either to undergo
myself the total crime or to accuse
my other self the partner of my life
whose failing while her faith to me remains
i should conceal and not expose to blame
by my complaint but strict necessity
subdues me and calamitous constraint
lest on my head both sin and punishment
however insupportable be all
devolved though should i hold my peace yet thou
wouldst easily detect what i conceal
this woman whom thou madest to be my help
and gavest me as thy perfect gift so good
so fit so acceptable so divine
that from her hand i could suspect no ill
and what she did whatever in itself
her doing seemed to justify the deed
she gave me of the tree and i did eat
to whom the sovran presence thus replied
was she thy god that her thou didst obey
before his voice or was she made thy guide
superiour or but equal that to her
thou didst resign thy manhood and the place
wherein god set thee above her made of thee
and for thee whose perfection far excelled
hers in all real dignity adorned
she was indeed and lovely to attract
thy love not thy subjection and her gifts
were such as under government well seemed
unseemly to bear rule which was thy part
and person hadst thou known thyself aright
so having said he thus to eve in few
say woman what is this which thou hast done
to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed
confessing soon yet not before her judge
bold or loquacious thus abashed replied
the serpent me beguiled and i did eat
which when the lord god heard without delay
to judgement he proceeded on the accused
serpent though brute unable to transfer
the guilt on him who made him instrument
of mischief and polluted from the end
of his creation justly then accursed
as vitiated in nature more to know
concerned not man 
nor altered his offence yet god at last
to satan first in sin his doom applied
though in mysterious terms judged as then best
and on the serpent thus his curse let fall
because thou hast done this thou art accursed
above all cattle each beast of the field
upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go
and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life
between thee and the woman i will put
enmity and between thine and her seed
her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel
so spake this oracle then verified
when jesus son of mary second eve
saw satan fall like lightning down from heaven
prince of the air then rising from his grave
spoiled principalities and powers triumphed
in open show and with ascension bright
captivity led captive through the air
the realm itself of satan long usurped
whom he shall tread at last under our feet
even he who now foretold his fatal bruise
and to the woman thus his sentence turned
thy sorrow i will greatly multiply
by thy conception children thou shalt bring
in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
thine shall submit he over thee shall rule
on adam last thus judgement he pronounced
because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife
and eaten of the tree concerning which
i charged thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof
cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground for thou
out of the ground wast taken know thy birth
for dust thou art and shalt to dust return
so judged he man both judge and saviour sent
and the instant stroke of death denounced that day
removed far off then pitying how they stood
before him naked to the air that now
must suffer change disdained not to begin
thenceforth the form of servant to assume
as when he washed his servants feet so now
as father of his family he clad
their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain
or as the snake with youthful coat repaid
and thought not much to clothe his enemies
nor he their outward only with the skins
of beasts but inward nakedness much more
opprobrious with his robe of righteousness
arraying covered from his fathers sight
to him with swift ascent he up returned
into his blissful bosom reassumed
in glory as of old to him appeased
all though allknowing what had passed with man
recounted mixing intercession sweet
mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on earth
within the gates of hell sat sin and death
in counterview within the gates that now
stood open wide belching outrageous flame
far into chaos since the fiend passed through
sin opening who thus now to death began
o son why sit we here each other viewing
idly while satan our great author thrives
in other worlds and happier seat provides
for us his offspring dear it cannot be
but that success attends him if mishap
ere this he had returned with fury driven
by his avengers since no place like this
can fit his punishment or their revenge
methinks i feel new strength within me rise
wings growing and dominion given me large
beyond this deep whatever draws me on
or sympathy or some connatural force
powerful at greatest distance to unite
with secret amity things of like kind
by secretest conveyance thou my shade
inseparable must with me along
for death from sin no power can separate
but lest the difficulty of passing back
stay his return perhaps over this gulf
impassable impervious let us try
adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
not unagreeable to found a path
over this main from hell to that new world
where satan now prevails a monument
of merit high to all the infernal host
easing their passage hence for intercourse
or transmigration as their lot shall lead
nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn
by this newfelt attraction and instinct
whom thus the meager shadow answered soon
go whither fate and inclination strong
leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err
the way thou leading such a scent i draw
of carnage prey innumerable and taste
the savour of death from all things there that live
nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest
be wanting but afford thee equal aid
so saying with delight he snuffed the smell
of mortal change on earth as when a flock
of ravenous fowl though many a league remote
against the day of battle to a field
where armies lie encamped come flying lured
with scent of living carcasses designed
for death the following day in bloody fight
so scented the grim feature and upturned
his nostril wide into the murky air
sagacious of his quarry from so far
then both from out hellgates into the waste
wide anarchy of chaos damp and dark
flew diverse and with power 
hovering upon the waters what they met
solid or slimy as in raging sea
tost up and down together crouded drove
from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell
as when two polar winds blowing adverse
upon the cronian sea together drive
mountains of ice that stop the imagined way
beyond petsora eastward to the rich
cathaian coast the aggregated soil
death with his mace petrifick cold and dry
as with a trident smote and fixed as firm
as delos floating once the rest his look
bound with gorgonian rigour not to move
and with asphaltick slime broad as the gate
deep to the roots of hell the gathered beach
they fastened and the mole immense wrought on
over the foaming deep higharched a bridge
of length prodigious joining to the wall
immoveable of this now fenceless world
forfeit to death from hence a passage broad
smooth easy inoffensive down to hell
so if great things to small may be compared
xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke
from susa his memnonian palace high
came to the sea and over hellespont
bridging his way europe with asia joined
and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
now had they brought the work by wonderous art
pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
over the vexed abyss following the track
of satan to the selfsame place where he
first lighted from his wing and landed safe
from out of chaos to the outside bare
of this round world with pins of adamant
and chains they made all fast too fast they made
and durable and now in little space
the confines met of empyrean heaven
and of this world and on the left hand hell
with long reach interposed three several ways
in sight to each of these three places led
and now their way to earth they had descried
to paradise first tending when behold
satan in likeness of an angel bright
betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steering
his zenith while the sun in aries rose
disguised he came but those his children dear
their parent soon discerned though in disguise
he after eve seduced unminded slunk
into the wood fast by and changing shape
to observe the sequel saw his guileful act
by eve though all unweeting seconded
upon her husband saw their shame that sought
vain covertures but when he saw descend
the son of god to judge them terrified
he fled not hoping to escape but shun
the present fearing guilty what his wrath
might suddenly inflict that past returned
by night and listening where the hapless pair
sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
thence gathered his own doom which understood
not instant but of future time with joy
and tidings fraught to hell he now returned
and at the brink of chaos near the foot
of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
met who to meet him came his offspring dear
great joy was at their meeting and at sight
of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased
long he admiring stood till sin his fair
enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
o parent these are thy magnifick deeds
thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
thou art their author and prime architect
for i no sooner in my heart divined
my heart which by a secret harmony
still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet
that thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
now also evidence but straight i felt
though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
that i must after thee with this thy son
such fatal consequence unites us three
hell could no longer hold us in our bounds
nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
detain from following thy illustrious track
thou hast achieved our liberty confined
within hellgates till now thou us impowered
to fortify thus far and overlay
with this portentous bridge the dark abyss
thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
what thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
with odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
our foil in heaven here thou shalt monarch reign
there didst not there let him still victor sway
as battle hath adjudged from this new world
retiring by his own doom alienated
and henceforth monarchy with thee divide
of all things parted by the empyreal bounds
his quadrature from thy orbicular world
or try thee now more dangerous to his throne
whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad
fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both
high proof ye now have given to be the race
of satan 
amply have merited of me of all
the infernal empire that so near heavens door
triumphal with triumphal act have met
mine with this glorious work and made one realm
hell and this world one realm one continent
of easy thoroughfare therefore while i
descend through darkness on your road with ease
to my associate powers them to acquaint
with these successes and with them rejoice
you two this way among these numerous orbs
all yours right down to paradise descend
there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
dominion exercise and in the air
chiefly on man sole lord of all declared
him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill
my substitutes i send ye and create
plenipotent on earth of matchless might
issuing from me on your joint vigour now
my hold of this new kingdom all depends
through sin to death exposed by my exploit
if your joint power prevail the affairs of hell
no detriment need fear go and be strong
so saying he dismissed them they with speed
their course through thickest constellations held
spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan
and planets planetstruck real eclipse
then suffered the other way satan went down
the causey to hellgate on either side
disparted chaos overbuilt exclaimed
and with rebounding surge the bars assailed
that scorned his indignation through the gate
wide open and unguarded satan passed
and all about found desolate for those
appointed to sit there had left their charge
flown to the upper world the rest were all
far to the inland retired about the walls
of pandemonium city and proud seat
of lucifer so by allusion called
of that bright star to satan paragoned
there kept their watch the legions while the grand
in council sat solicitous what chance
might intercept their emperour sent so he
departing gave command and they observed
as when the tartar from his russian foe
by astracan over the snowy plains
retires or bactrin sophi from the horns
of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
the realm of aladule in his retreat
to tauris or casbeen so these the late
heavenbanished host left desart utmost hell
many a dark league reduced in careful watch
round their metropolis and now expecting
each hour their great adventurer from the search
of foreign worlds he through the midst unmarked
in show plebeian angel militant
of lowest order passed and from the door
of that plutonian hall invisible
ascended his high throne which under state
of richest texture spread at the upper end
was placed in regal lustre down a while
he sat and round about him saw unseen
at last as from a cloud his fulgent head
and shape starbright appeared or brighter clad
with what permissive glory since his fall
was left him or false glitter all amazed
at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng
bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld
their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim
forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers
raised from their dark divan and with like joy
congratulant approached him who with hand
silence and with these words attention won
thrones dominations princedoms virtues powers
for in possession such not only of right
i call ye and declare ye now returned
successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
triumphant out of this infernal pit
abominable accursed the house of woe
and dungeon of our tyrant now possess
as lords a spacious world to our native heaven
little inferiour by my adventure hard
with peril great achieved long were to tell
what i have done what suffered with what pain
voyaged th unreal vast unbounded deep
of horrible confusion over which
by sin and death a broad way now is paved
to expedite your glorious march but i
toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
the untractable abyss plunged in the womb
of unoriginal night and chaos wild
that jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
my journey strange with clamorous uproar
protesting fate supreme thence how i found
the new created world which fame in heaven
long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
of absolute perfection therein man
placed in a paradise by our exile
made happy him by fraud i have seduced
from his creator and the more to encrease
your wonder with an apple he thereat
offended worth your laughter hath given up
both his beloved man and all his world
to sin and death a prey and so to us
without our hazard labour or alarm
to range in and to dwell and over man
to rule as over all he should have ruled
true is me also he hath judged or rather
me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
man i deceived that which to me belongs
is enmity which he will put between
me and mankind i am to bruise his heel
his seed when is not set shall bruise my head
a world who would not purchase with a bruise
or much more grievous painye have the account
of my performance what remains ye gods
but up and enter now into full bliss
so having said a while he stood expecting
their universal shout and high applause
to fill his ear when contrary he hears
on all sides from innumerable tongues
a dismal universal hiss the sound
of publick scorn he wondered but not long
had leisure wondering at himself now more
his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
his arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
each other till supplanted down he fell
a monstrous serpent on his belly prone
reluctant but in vain a greater power
now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
according to his doom he would have spoke
but hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
to forked tongue for now were all transformed
alike to serpents all as accessories
to his bold riot dreadful was the din
of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
with complicated monsters head and tail
scorpion and asp and amphisbaena dire
cerastes horned hydrus and elops drear
and dipsas  but still greatest he the midst
now dragon grown larger than whom the sun
ingendered in the pythian vale or slime
huge python and his power no less he seemed
above the rest still to retain they all
him followed issuing forth to the open field
where all yet left of that revolted rout
heavenfallen in station stood or just array
sublime with expectation when to see
in triumph issuing forth their glorious chief
they saw but other sight instead a croud
of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
and horrid sympathy for what they saw
they felt themselves now changing down their arms
down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
and the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
catched by contagion like in punishment
as in their crime thus was the applause they meant
turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
cast on themselves from their own mouths there stood
a grove hard by sprung up with this their change
his will who reigns above to aggravate
their penance laden with fair fruit like that
which grew in paradise the bait of eve
used by the tempter on that prospect strange
their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
for one forbidden tree a multitude
now risen to work them further woe or shame
yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
though to delude them sent could not abstain
but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
that curled megaera greedily they plucked
the fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed
this more delusive not the touch but taste
deceived they fondly thinking to allay
their appetite with gust instead of fruit
chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
into the same illusion not as man
whom they triumphed once lapsed thus were they plagued
and worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
till their lost shape permitted they resumed
yearly enjoined some say to undergo
this annual humbling certain numbered days
to dash their pride and joy for man seduced
however some tradition they dispersed
among the heathen of their purchase got
and fabled how the serpent whom they called
ophion with eurynome the wide
encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule
of high olympus thence by saturn driven
and ops ere yet dictaean jove was born
mean while in paradise the hellish pair
too soon arrived sin there in power before
once actual now in body and to dwell
habitual habitant behind her death
close following pace for pace not mounted yet
on his pale horse to whom sin thus began
second of satan sprung allconquering death
what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
with travel difficult not better far
than still at hells dark threshold to have sat watch
unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved
whom thus the sinborn monster answered soon
to me who with eternal famine pine
alike is hell or paradise or heaven
there best where most with ravine i may meet
which here though plenteous all too little seems
to stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
to whom the incestuous mother thus replied
thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
no homely morsels and whatever thing
the sithe of time mows down devour unspared
till i in man residing through the race
his thoughts his looks words actions all infect
and season him thy last and sweetest prey
this said they both betook them several ways
both to destroy or unimmortal make
all kinds and for destruction to mature
sooner or later which the almighty seeing
from his transcendent seat the saints among
to those bright orders uttered thus his voice
see with what heat these dogs of hell advance
to waste and havock yonder world which i
so fair and good created and had still
kept in that state had not the folly of man
let in these wasteful furies who impute
folly to me so doth the prince of hell
and his adherents that with so much ease
i suffer them to enter and possess
a place so heavenly and conniving seem
to gratify my scornful enemies
that laugh as if transported with some fit
of passion i to them had quitted all
at random yielded up to their misrule
and know not that i called and drew them thither
my hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth
which mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
on what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
with sucked and glutted offal at one sling
of thy victorious arm wellpleasing son
both sin and death and yawning grave at last
through chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of hell
for ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure
to sanctity that shall receive no stain
till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
he ended and the heavenly audience loud
sung halleluiah as the sound of seas
through multitude that sung just are thy ways
righteous are thy decrees on all thy works
who can extenuate thee next to the son
destined restorer of mankind by whom
new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise
or down from heaven descendsuch was their song
while the creator calling forth by name
his mighty angels gave them several charge
as sorted best with present things the sun
had first his precept so to move so shine
as might affect the earth with cold and heat
scarce tolerable and from the north to call
decrepit winter from the south to bring
solstitial summers heat to the blanc moon
her office they prescribed to the other five
their planetary motions and aspects
in sextile square and trine and opposite
of noxious efficacy and when to join
in synod unbenign and taught the fixed
their influence malignant when to shower
which of them rising with the sun or falling
should prove tempestuous to the winds they set
their corners when with bluster to confound
sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
with terrour through the dark aereal hall
some say he bid his angels turn ascanse
the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more
from the suns axle they with labour pushed
oblique the centrick globe some say the sun
was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
like distant breadth to taurus with the seven
atlantick sisters and the spartan twins
up to the tropick crab thence down amain
by leo and the virgin and the scales
as deep as capricorn to bring in change
of seasons to each clime else had the spring
perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers
equal in days and nights except to those
beyond the polar circles to them day
had unbenighted shone while the low sun
to recompense his distance in their sight
had rounded still the horizon and not known
or east or west which had forbid the snow
from cold estotiland and south as far
beneath magellan at that tasted fruit
the sun as from thyestean banquet turned
his course intended else how had the world
inhabited though sinless more than now
avoided pinching cold and scorching heat
these changes in the heavens though slow produced
like change on sea and land sideral blast
vapour and mist and exhalation hot
corrupt and pestilent now from the north
of norumbega and the samoed shore
bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
boreas and caecias and argestes loud
and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
with adverse blast upturns them from the south
notus and afer black with thunderous clouds
from serraliona thwart of these as fierce
forth rush the levant and the ponent winds
eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise
sirocco and libecchio thus began
outrage from lifeless things but discord first
daughter of sin among the irrational
death introduced through fierce antipathy
beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
devoured each other nor stood much in awe
of man but fled him or with countenance grim
glared on him passing these were from without
the growing miseries which adam saw
already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
to sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
and in a troubled sea of passion tost
thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
o miserable of happy is this the end
of this new glorious world and me so late
the glory of that glory who now become
accursed of blessed hide me from the face
of god whom to behold was then my highth
of happinessyet well if here would end
the misery i deserved it and would bear
my own deservings but this will not serve
all that i eat or drink or shall beget
is propagated curse o voice once heard
delightfully encrease and multiply
now death to hear for what can i encrease
or multiply but curses on my head
who of all ages to succeed but feeling
the evil on him brought by me will curse
my head ill fare our ancestor impure
for this we may thank adam but his thanks
shall be the execration so besides
mine own that bide upon me all from me
shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
on me as on their natural center light
heavy though in their place o fleeting joys
of paradise dear bought with lasting woes
did i request thee maker from my clay
to mould me man did i solicit thee
from darkness to promote me or here place
in this delicious garden as my will
concurred not to my being it were but right
and equal to reduce me to my dust
desirous to resign and render back
all i received unable to perform
thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
the good i sought not to the loss of that
sufficient penalty why hast thou added
the sense of endless woes inexplicable
thy justice seems yet to say truth too late
i thus contest then should have been refused
those terms whatever when they were proposed
thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good
then cavil the conditions and though god
made thee without thy leave what if thy son
prove disobedient and reproved retort
wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not
wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
that proud excuse yet him not thy election
but natural necessity begot
god made thee of choice his own and of his own
to serve him thy reward was of his grace
thy punishment then justly is at his will
be it so for i submit his doom is fair
that dust i am and shall to dust return
o welcome hour whenever why delays
his hand to execute what his decree
fixed on this day why do i overlive
why am i mocked with death and lengthened out
to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
mortality my sentence and be earth
insensible how glad would lay me down
as in my mothers lap there i should rest
and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
to me and to my offspring would torment me
with cruel expectation yet one doubt
pursues me still lest all i cannot die
lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man
which god inspired cannot together perish
with this corporeal clod then in the grave
or in some other dismal place who knows
but i shall die a living death o thought
horrid if true yet why it was but breath
of life that sinned what dies but what had life
and sin the body properly had neither
all of me then shall die let this appease
the doubt since human reach no further knows
for though the lord of all be infinite
is his wrath also be it man is not so
but mortal doomed how can he exercise
wrath without end on man whom death must end
can he make deathless death that were to make
strange contradiction which to god himself
impossible is held as argument
of weakness not of power will he draw out
for angers sake finite to infinite
in punished man to satisfy his rigour
satisfied never that were to extend
his sentence beyond dust and natures law
by which all causes else according still
to the reception of their matter act
not to the extent of their own sphere but say
that death be not one stroke as i supposed
bereaving sense but endless misery
from this day onward which i feel begun
both in me and without me and so last
to perpetuityay me that fear
comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
on my defenceless head both death and i
am found eternal and incorporate both
nor i on my part single in me all
posterity stands cursed fair patrimony
that i must leave ye sons o were i able
to waste it all myself and leave ye none
so disinherited how would you bless
me now your curse ah why should all mankind
for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
it guiltless but from me what can proceed
but all corrupt both mind and will depraved
not to do only but to will the same
with me how can they then acquitted stand
in sight of god him after all disputes
forced i absolve all my evasions vain
and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
but to my own conviction first and last
on me me only as the source and spring
of all corruption all the blame lights due
so might the wrath fond wish couldst thou support
that burden heavier than the earth to bear
than all the world much heavier though divided
with that bad woman thus what thou desirest
and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
of refuge and concludes thee miserable
beyond all past example and future
to satan only like both crime and doom
o conscience into what abyss of fears
and horrours hast thou driven me out of which
i find no way from deep to deeper plunged
thus adam to himself lamented loud
through the still night not now as ere man fell
wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
which to his evil conscience represented
all things with double terrour on the ground
outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
cursed his creation death as oft accused
of tardy execution since denounced
the day of his offence why comes not death
said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
to end me shall truth fail to keep her word
justice divine not hasten to be just
but death comes not at call justice divine
mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowers
with other echo late i taught your shades
to answer and resound far other song
whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld
desolate where she sat approaching nigh
soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
but her with stern regard he thus repelled
out of my sight thou serpent that name best
befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
like his and colour serpentine may show
thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
to hellish falshood snare them but for thee
i had persisted happy had not thy pride
and wandering vanity when least was safe
rejected my forewarning and disdained
not to be trusted longing to be seen
though by the devil himself him overweening
to overreach but with the serpent meeting
fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee
to trust thee from my side imagined wise
constant mature proof against all assaults
and understood not all was but a show
rather than solid virtue all but a rib
crooked by nature bent as now appears
more to the part sinister from me drawn
well if thrown out as supernumerary
to my just number found o why did god
creator wise that peopled highest heaven
with spirits masculine create at last
this novelty on earth this fair defect
of nature and not fill the world at once
with men as angels without feminine
or find some other way to generate
mankind this mischief had not been befallen
and more that shall befall innumerable
disturbances on earth through female snares
and strait conjunction with this sex for either
he never shall find out fit mate but such
as some misfortune brings him or mistake
or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
through her perverseness but shall see her gained
by a far worse or if she love withheld
by parents or his happiest choice too late
shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
to a fell adversary his hate or shame
which infinite calamity shall cause
to human life and houshold peace confound
he added not and from her turned but eve
not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
and tresses all disordered at his feet
fell humble and embracing them besought
his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
forsake me not thus adam witness heaven
what love sincere and reverence in my heart
i bear thee and unweeting have offended
unhappily deceived thy suppliant
i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid
thy counsel in this uttermost distress
my only strength and stay forlorn of thee
whither shall i betake me where subsist
while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps
between us two let there be peace both joining
as joined in injuries one enmity
against a foe by doom express assigned us
that cruel serpent on me exercise not
thy hatred for this misery befallen
on me already lost me than thyself
more miserable both have sinned but thou
against god only i against god and thee
and to the place of judgement will return
there with my cries importune heaven that all
the sentence from thy head removed may light
on me sole cause to thee of all this woe
me me only just object of his ire
she ended weeping and her lowly plight
immoveable till peace obtained from fault
acknowledged and deplored in adam wrought
commiseration soon his heart relented
towards her his life so late and sole delight
now at his feet submissive in distress
creature so fair his reconcilement seeking
his counsel whom she had displeased his aid
as one disarmed his anger all he lost
and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon
unwary and too desirous as before
so now of what thou knowest not who desirest
the punishment all on thyself alas
bear thine own first ill able to sustain
his full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part
and my displeasure bearest so ill if prayers
could alter high decrees i to that place
would speed before thee and be louder heard
that on my head all might be visited
thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven
to me committed and by me exposed
but riselet us no more contend nor blame
each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
in offices of love how we may lighten
each others burden in our share of woe
since this days death denounced if aught i see
will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
a long days dying to augment our pain
and to our seed  derived
to whom thus eve recovering heart replied
adam by sad experiment i know
how little weight my words with thee can find
found so erroneous thence by just event
found so unfortunate nevertheless
restored by thee vile as i am to place
of new acceptance hopeful to regain
thy love the sole contentment of my heart
living or dying from thee i will not hide
what thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
tending to some relief of our extremes
or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
as in our evils and of easier choice
if care of our descent perplex us most
which must be born to certain woe devoured
by death at last and miserable it is
to be to others cause of misery
our own begotten and of our loins to bring
into this cursed world a woeful race
that after wretched life must be at last
food for so foul a monster in thy power
it lies yet ere conception to prevent
the race unblest to being yet unbegot
childless thou art childless remain so death
shall be deceived his glut and with us two
be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw
but if thou judge it hard and difficult
conversing looking loving to abstain
from loves due rights nuptial embraces sweet
and with desire to languish without hope
before the present object languishing
with like desire which would be misery
and torment less than none of what we dread
then both ourselves and seed at once to free
from what we fear for both let us make short
let us seek deathor he not found supply
with our own hands his office on ourselves
why stand we longer shivering under fears
that show no end but death and have the power
of many ways to die the shortest choosing
destruction with destruction to destroy
she ended here or vehement despair
broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale
but adam with such counsel nothing swayed
to better hopes his more attentive mind
labouring had raised and thus to eve replied
eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
to argue in thee something more sublime
and excellent than what thy mind contemns
but selfdestruction therefore sought refutes
that excellence thought in thee and implies
not thy contempt but anguish and regret
for loss of life and pleasure overloved
or if thou covet death as utmost end
of misery so thinking to evade
the penalty pronounced doubt not but god
hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
to be forestalled much more i fear lest death
so snatched will not exempt us from the pain
we are by doom to pay rather such acts
of contumacy will provoke the highest
to make death in us live then let us seek
some safer resolution which methinks
i have in view calling to mind with heed
part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
the serpents head piteous amends unless
be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe
satan who in the serpent hath contrived
against us this deceit to crush his head
would be revenge indeed which will be lost
by death brought on ourselves or childless days
resolved as thou proposest so our foe
shal scape his punishment ordained and we
instead shall double ours upon our heads
no more be mentioned then of violence
against ourselves and wilful barrenness
that cuts us off from hope and savours only
rancour and pride impatience and despite
reluctance against god and his just yoke
laid on our necks remember with what mild
and gracious temper he both heard and judged
without wrath or reviling we expected
immediate dissolution which we thought
was meant by death that day when lo to thee
pains only in childbearing were foretold
and bringing forth soon recompensed with joy
fruit of thy womb on me the curse aslope
glanced on the ground with labour i must earn
my bread what harm idleness had been worse
my labour will sustain me and lest cold
or heat should injure us his timely care
hath unbesought provided and his hands
clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged
how much more if we pray him will his ear
be open and his heart to pity incline
and teach us further by what means to shun
the inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow
which now the sky with various face begins
to show us in this mountain while the winds
blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star
leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
reflected may with matter sere foment
or by collision of two bodies grind
the air attrite to fire as late the clouds
justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock
tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine
and sends a comfortable heat from far
which might supply the sun such fire to use
and what may else be remedy or cure
to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought
he will instruct us praying and of grace
beseeching him so as we need not fear
to pass commodiously this life sustained
by him with many comforts till we end
in dust our final rest and native home
what better can we do than to the place
repairing where he judged us prostrate fall
before him reverent and there confess
humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears
watering the ground and with our sighs the air
frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek
undoubtedly he will relent and turn
from his displeasure in whose look serene
when angry most he seemed and most severe
what else but favour grace and mercy shone
so spake our father penitent nor eve
felt less remorse they forthwith to the place
repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
before him reverent and both confessed
humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears
watering the ground and with their sighs the air
frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek






thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
praying for from the mercyseat above
prevenient grace descending had removed
the stony from their hearts and made new flesh
regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
unutterable which the spirit of prayer
inspired and winged for heaven with speedier flight
than loudest oratory yet their port
not of mean suitors nor important less
seemed their petition than when the ancient pair
in fables old less ancient yet than these
deucalion and chaste pyrrha to restore
the race of mankind drowned before the shrine
of themis stood devout to heaven their prayers
flew up nor missed the way by envious winds
blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed
dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
with incense where the golden altar fumed
by their great intercessour came in sight
before the fathers throne them the glad son
presenting thus to intercede began
see father what firstfruits on earth are sprung
from thy implanted grace in man these sighs
and prayers which in this golden censer mixed
with incense i thy priest before thee bring
fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
sown with contrition in his heart than those
which his own hand manuring all the trees
of paradise could have produced ere fallen
from innocence now therefore bend thine ear
to supplication hear his sighs though mute
unskilful with what words to pray let me
interpret for him me his advocate
and propitiation all his works on me
good or not good ingraft my merit those
shall perfect and for these my death shall pay
accept me and in me from these receive
the smell of peace toward mankind let him live
before thee reconciled at least his days
numbered though sad till death his doom 
to better life shall yield him where with me
all my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
made one with me as i with thee am one
to whom the father without cloud serene
all thy request for man accepted son
obtain all thy request was my decree
but longer in that paradise to dwell
the law i gave to nature him forbids
those pure immortal elements that know
no gross no unharmonious mixture foul
eject him tainted now and purge him off
as a distemper gross to air as gross
and mortal food as may dispose him best
for dissolution wrought by sin that first
distempered all things and of incorrupt
corrupted i at first with two fair gifts
created him endowed with happiness
and immortality that fondly lost
this other served but to eternize woe
till i provided death so death becomes
his final remedy and after life
tried in sharp tribulation and refined
by faith and faithful works to second life
waked in the renovation of the just
resigns him up with heaven and earth renewed
but let us call to synod all the blest
through heavens wide bounds from them i will not hide
my judgements how with mankind i proceed
as how with peccant angels late they saw
and in their state though firm stood more confirmed
he ended and the son gave signal high
to the bright minister that watched he blew
his trumpet heard in oreb since perhaps
when god descended and perhaps once more
to sound at general doom the angelick blast
filled all the regions from their blisful bowers
of amarantine shade fountain or spring
by the waters of life whereer they sat
in fellowships of joy the sons of light
hasted resorting to the summons high
and took their seats till from his throne supreme
the almighty thus pronounced his sovran will
o sons like one of us man is become
to know both good and evil since his taste
of that defended fruit but let him boast
his knowledge of good lost and evil got
happier had it sufficed him to have known
good by itself and evil not at all
he sorrows now repents and prays contrite
my motions in him longer than they move
his heart i know how variable and vain
selfleft lest therefore his now bolder hand
reach also of the tree of life and eat
and live for ever dream at least to live
for ever to remove him i decree
and send him from the garden forth to till
the ground whence he was taken fitter soil
michael this my behest have thou in charge
take to thee from among the cherubim
thy choice of flaming warriours lest the fiend
or in behalf of man or to invade
vacant possession some new trouble raise
haste thee and from the paradise of god
without remorse drive out the sinful pair
from hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
to them and to their progeny from thence
perpetual banishment yet lest they faint
at the sad sentence rigorously urged
 all terrour hide
if patiently thy bidding they obey
dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
to adam what shall come in future days
as i shall thee enlighten intermix
my covenant in the womans seed renewed
so send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace
and on the east side of the garden place
where entrance up from eden easiest climbs
cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
widewaving all approach far off to fright
and guard all passage to the tree of life
lest paradise a receptacle prove
to spirits foul and all my trees their prey
with whose stolen fruit man once more to delude
he ceased and the archangelick power prepared
for swift descent with him the cohort bright
of watchful cherubim four faces each
had like a double janus all their shape
spangled with eyes more numerous than those
of argus and more wakeful than to drouse
charmed with arcadian pipe the pastoral reed
of hermes or his opiate rod mean while
to resalute the world with sacred light
leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed
the earth when adam and first matron eve
had ended now their orisons and found
strength added from above new hope to spring
out of despair joy but with fear yet linked
which thus to eve his welcome words renewed
eve easily my faith admit that all
the good which we enjoy from heaven descends
but that from us aught should ascend to heaven
so prevalent as to concern the mind
of god highblest or to incline his will
hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
or one short sigh of human breath upborne
even to the seat of god for since i sought
by prayer the offended deity to appease
kneeled and before him humbled all my heart
methought i saw him placable and mild
bending his ear persuasion in me grew
that i was heard with favour peace returned
home to my breast and to my memory
his promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe
which then not minded in dismay yet now
assures me that the bitterness of death
is past and we shall live whence hail to thee
eve rightly called mother of all mankind
mother of all things living since by thee
man is to live and all things live for man
to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek
illworthy i such title should belong
to me transgressour who for thee ordained
a help became thy snare to me reproach
rather belongs distrust and all dispraise
but infinite in pardon was my judge
that i who first brought death on all am graced
the source of life next favourable thou
who highly thus to entitle me vouchsafst
far other name deserving but the field
to labour calls us now with sweat imposed
though after sleepless night for see the morn
all unconcerned with our unrest begins
her rosy progress smiling let us forth
i never from thy side henceforth to stray
whereer our days work lies though now enjoined
laborious till day droop while here we dwell
what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks
here let us live though in fallen state content
so spake so wished much humbled eve but fate
subscribed not nature first gave signs impressed
on bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed
after short blush of morn nigh in her sight
the bird of jove stooped from his aery tour
two birds of gayest plume before him drove
down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods
first hunter then pursued a gentle brace
goodliest of all the forest hart and hind
direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight
adam observed and with his eye the chase
pursuing not unmoved to eve thus spake
o eve some further change awaits us nigh
which heaven by these mute signs in nature shows
forerunners of his purpose or to warn
us haply too secure of our discharge
from penalty because from death released
some days how long and what till then our life
who knows or more than this that we are dust
and thither must return and be no more
why else this double object in our sight
of flight pursued in the air and oer the ground
one way the selfsame hour why in the east
darkness ere days midcourse and morninglight
more orient in yon western cloud that draws
oer the blue firmament a radiant white
and slow descends with something heavenly fraught
he erred not for by this the heavenly bands
down from a sky of jasper lighted now
in paradise and on a hill made halt
a glorious apparition had not doubt
and carnal fear that day dimmed adams eye
not that more glorious when the angels met
jacob in mahanaim where he saw
the field pavilioned with his guardians bright
nor that which on the flaming mount appeared
in dothan covered with a camp of fire
against the syrian king who to surprise
one man assassinlike had levied war
war unproclaimed the princely hierarch
in their bright stand there left his powers to seise
possession of the garden he alone
to find where adam sheltered took his way
not unperceived of adam who to eve
while the great visitant approached thus spake
eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
of us will soon determine or impose
new laws to be observed for i descry
from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill
one of the heavenly host and by his gait
none of the meanest some great potentate
or of the thrones above such majesty
invests him coming yet not terrible
that i should fear nor sociably mild
as raphael that i should much confide
but solemn and sublime whom not to offend
with reverence i must meet and thou retire
he ended and the archangel soon drew nigh
not in his shape celestial but as man
clad to meet man over his lucid arms
a military vest of purple flowed
livelier than meliboean or the grain
of sarra worn by kings and heroes old
in time of truce iris had dipt the woof
his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
in manhood where youth ended by his side
as in a glistering zodiack hung the sword
satans dire dread and in his hand the spear
adam bowed low he kingly from his state
inclined not but his coming thus declared
adam heavens high behest no preface needs
sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death
then due by sentence when thou didst transgress
defeated of his seisure many days
given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent
and one bad act with many deeds well done
mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased
redeem thee quite from deaths rapacious claim
but longer in this paradise to dwell
permits not to remove thee i am come
and send thee from the garden forth to till
the ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil
he added not for adam at the news
heartstruck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood
that all his senses bound eve who unseen
yet all had heard with audible lament
discovered soon the place of her retire
o unexpected stroke worse than of death
must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave
thee native soil these happy walks and shades
fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend
quiet though sad the respite of that day
that must be mortal to us both o flowers
that never will in other climate grow
my early visitation and my last
at even which i bred up with tender hand
from the first opening bud and gave ye names
who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount
thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
how shall i part and whither wander down
into a lower world to this obscure
and wild how shall we breathe in other air
less pure accustomed to immortal fruits
whom thus the angel interrupted mild
lament not eve but patiently resign
what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart
thus overfond on that which is not thine
thy going is not lonely with thee goes
thy husband whom to follow thou art bound
where he abides think there thy native soil
adam by this from the cold sudden damp
recovering and his scattered spirits returned
to michael thus his humble words addressed
celestial whether among the thrones or named
of them the highest for such of shape may seem
prince above princes gently hast thou told
thy message which might else in telling wound
and in performing end us what besides
of sorrow and dejection and despair
our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring
departure from this happy place our sweet
recess and only consolation left
familiar to our eyes all places else
inhospitable appear and desolate
nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer
incessant i could hope to change the will
of him who all things can i would not cease
to weary him with my assiduous cries
but prayer against his absolute decree
no more avails than breath against the wind
blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth
therefore to his great bidding i submit
this most afflicts me that departing hence
as from his face i shall be hid deprived
his blessed countenance here i could frequent
with worship place by place where he vouchsafed
presence divine and to my sons relate
on this mount he appeared under this tree
stood visible among these pines his voice
i heard here with him at this fountain talked
so many grateful altars i would rear
of grassy turf and pile up every stone
of lustre from the brook in memory
or monument to ages and theron
offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers
in yonder nether world where shall i seek
his bright appearances or footstep trace
for though i fled him angry yet recalled
to life prolonged and promised race i now
gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
of glory and far off his steps adore
to whom thus michael with regard benign
adam thou knowest heaven his and all the earth
not this rock only his omnipresence fills
land sea and air and every kind that lives
fomented by his virtual power and warmed
all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
no despicable gift surmise not then
his presence to these narrow bounds confined
of paradise or eden this had been
perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
all generations and had hither come
from all the ends of the earth to celebrate
and reverence thee their great progenitor
but this preeminence thou hast lost brought down
to dwell on even ground now with thy sons
yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
god is as here and will be found alike
present and of his presence many a sign
still following thee still compassing thee round
with goodness and paternal love his face
express and of his steps the track divine
which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
ere thou from hence depart know i am sent
to show thee what shall come in future days
to thee and to thy offspring good with bad
expect to hear supernal grace contending
with sinfulness of men thereby to learn
true patience and to temper joy with fear
and pious sorrow equally inured
by moderation either state to bear
prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
safest thy life and best prepared endure
thy mortal passage when it comesascend
this hill let eve 
here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest
as once thou sleptst while she to life was formed
to whom thus adam gratefully replied
ascend i follow thee safe guide the path
thou leadest me and to the hand of heaven submit
however chastening to the evil turn
my obvious breast arming to overcome
by suffering and earn rest from labour won
if so i may attainso both ascend
in the visions of god it was a hill
of paradise the highest from whose top
the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken
stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay
not higher that hill nor wider looking round
whereon for different cause the tempter set
our second adam in the wilderness
to show him all earths kingdoms and their glory
his eye might there command wherever stood
city of old or modern fame the seat
of mightiest empire from the destined walls
of cambalu seat of cathaian can
and samarchand by oxus temirs throne
to paquin of sinaean kings and thence
to agra and lahor of great mogul
down to the golden chersonese or where
the persian in ecbatan sat or since
in hispahan or where the russian ksar
in mosco or the sultan in bizance
turchestanborn nor could his eye not ken
the empire of negus to his utmost port
ercoco and the less maritim kings
mombaza and quiloa and melind
and sofala thought ophir to the realm
of congo and angola farthest south
or thence from niger flood to atlas mount
the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus
morocco and algiers and tremisen
on europe thence and where rome was to sway
the world in spirit perhaps he also saw
rich mexico the seat of montezume
and cusco in peru the richer seat
of atabalipa and yet unspoiled
guiana whose great city geryons sons
call el dorado but to nobler sights
michael from adams eyes the film removed
which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
the visual nerve for he had much to see
and from the well of life three drops instilled
so deep the power of these ingredients pierced
even to the inmost seat of mental sight
that adam now enforced to close his eyes
sunk down and all his spirits became entranced
but him the gentle angel by the hand
soon raised and his attention thus recalled
adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
the effects which thy original crime hath wrought
in some to spring from thee who never touched
the excepted tree nor with the snake conspired
nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
corruption to bring forth more violent deeds
his eyes he opened and beheld a field
part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
new reaped the other part sheepwalks and folds
i the midst an altar as the landmark stood
rustick of grassy sord thither anon
a sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
first fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf
unculled as came to hand a shepherd next
more meek came with the firstlings of his flock
choicest and best then sacrificing laid
the inwards and their fat with incense strowed
on the cleft wood and all due rights performed
his offering soon propitious fire from heaven
consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam
the others not for his was not sincere
whereat he inly raged and as they talked
smote him into the midriff with a stone
that beat out life he fell and deadly pale
groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused
much at that sight was adam in his heart
dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried
o teacher some great mischief hath befallen
to that meek man who well had sacrificed
is piety thus and pure devotion paid
to whom michael thus he also moved replied
these two are brethren adam and to come
out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain
for envy that his brothers offering found
from heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
will be avenged and the others faith approved
lose no reward though here thou see him die
rolling in dust and gore to which our sire
alas both for the deed and for the cause
but have i now seen death is this the way
i must return to native dust o sight
of terrour foul and ugly to behold
horrid to think how horrible to feel
to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
in his first shape on man but many shapes
of death and many are the ways that lead
to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
more terrible at the entrance than within
some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die
by fire flood famine by intemperance more
in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
what misery the inabstinence of eve
shall bring on men immediately a place
before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark
a lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid
numbers of all diseased all maladies
of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms
of heartsick agony all feverous kinds
convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs
intestine stone and ulcer colickpangs
demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy
and moonstruck madness pining atrophy
marasmus and widewasting pestilence
dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums
dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
tended the sick busiest from couch to couch
and over them triumphant death his dart
shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked
with vows as their chief good and final hope
sight so deform what heart of rock could long
dryeyed behold adam could not but wept
though not of woman born compassion quelled
his best of man and gave him up to tears
a space till firmer thoughts restrained excess
and scarce recovering words his plaint renewed
o miserable mankind to what fall
degraded to what wretched state reserved
better end here unborn why is life given
to be thus wrested from us rather why
obtruded on us thus who if we knew
what we receive would either no accept
life offered or soon beg to lay it down
glad to be so dismissed in peace can thus
the image of god in man created once
so goodly and erect though faulty since
to such unsightly sufferings be debased
under inhuman pains why should not man
retaining still divine similitude
in part from such deformities be free
and for his makers image sake exempt
their makers image answered michael then
forsook them when themselves they vilified
to serve ungoverned appetite and took
his image whom they served a brutish vice
inductive mainly to the sin of eve
therefore so abject is their punishment
disfiguring not gods likeness but their own
or if his likeness by themselves defaced
while they pervert pure natures healthful rules
to loathsome sickness worthily since they
gods image did not reverence in themselves
i yield it just said adam and submit
but is there yet no other way besides
these painful passages how we may come
to death and mix with our connatural dust
there is said michael if thou well observe
the rule of not too much by temperance taught
in what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence
due nourishment not gluttonous delight
till many years over thy head return
so mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
into thy mothers lap or be with ease
gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature
this is old age but then thou must outlive
thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
to withered weak and gray thy senses then
obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego
to what thou hast and for the air of youth
hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign
a melancholy damp of cold and dry
to weigh thy spirits down and last consume
the balm of life to whom our ancestor
henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong
life much bent rather how i may be quit
fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge
which i must keep till my appointed day
of rendering up and patiently attend
my dissolution michael replied
nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest
live well how long or short permit to heaven
and now prepare thee for another sight
he looked and saw a spacious plain whereon
were tents of various hue by some were herds
of cattle grazing others whence the sound
of instruments that made melodious chime
was heard of harp and organ and who moved
their stops and chords was seen his volant touch
instinct through all proportions low and high
fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue
in other part stood one who at the forge
labouring two massy clods of iron and brass
had melted  the liquid ore he drained
into fit moulds prepared from which he formed
first his own tools then what might else be wrought
fusil or graven in metal after these
but on the hither side a different sort
from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat
down to the plain descended by their guise
just men they seemed and all their study bent
to worship god aright and know his works
not hid nor those things last which might preserve
freedom and peace to men they on the plain
long had not walked when from the tents behold
a bevy of fair women richly gay
in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
soft amorous ditties and in dance came on
the men though grave eyed them and let their eyes
rove without rein till in the amorous net
fast caught they liked and each his liking chose
and now of love they treat till the eveningstar
loves harbinger appeared then all in heat
they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
hymen then first to marriage rites invoked
with feast and musick all the tents resound
such happy interview and fair event
of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers
and charming symphonies attached the heart
of adam soon inclined to admit delight
the bent of nature which he thus expressed
true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest
much better seems this vision and more hope
of peaceful days portends than those two past
those were of hate and death or pain much worse
here nature seems fulfilled in all her ends
to whom thus michael judge not what is best
by pleasure though to nature seeming meet
created as thou art to nobler end
holy and pure conformity divine
those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents
of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
who slew his brother studious they appear
of arts that polish life inventers rare
unmindful of their maker though his spirit
taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none
yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget
for that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed
of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay
yet empty of all good wherein consists
womans domestick honour and chief praise
bred only and completed to the taste
of lustful appetence to sing to dance
to dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye
to these that sober race of men whose lives
religious titled them the sons of god
shall yield up all their virtue all their fame
ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
of these fair atheists and now swim in joy
erelong to swim at large and laugh for which
the world erelong a world of tears must weep
to whom thus adam of short joy bereft
o pity and shame that they who to live well
entered so fair should turn aside to tread
paths indirect or in the mid way faint
but still i see the tenour of mans woe
holds on the same from woman to begin
from mans effeminate slackness it begins
said the angel who should better hold his place
by wisdom and superiour gifts received
but now prepare thee for another scene
he looked and saw wide territory spread
before him towns and rural works between
cities of men with lofty gates and towers
concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war
giants of mighty bone and bold emprise
part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed
single or in array of battle ranged
both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood
one way a band select from forage drives
a herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine
from a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock
ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain
their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly
but call in aid which makes a bloody fray
with cruel tournament the squadrons join
where cattle pastured late now scattered lies
with carcasses and arms the ensanguined field
deserted others to a city strong
lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine
assaulting others from the wall defend
with dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire
on each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds
in other part the sceptered heralds call
to council in the citygates anon
grayheaded men and grave with warriours mixed
assemble and harangues are heard but soon
in factious opposition till at last
of middle age one rising eminent
in wise deport spake much of right and wrong
of justice or religion truth and peace
and judgement from above him old and young
exploded and had seized with violent hands
had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
unseen amid the throng so violence
proceeded and oppression and swordlaw
through all the plain and refuge none was found
adam was all in tears and to his guide
lamenting turned full sad o what are these
deaths ministers not men who thus deal death
inhumanly to men and multiply
ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
his brother for of whom such massacre
make they but of their brethren men of men
but who was that just man whom had not heaven
rescued had in his righteousness been lost
to whom thus michael these are the product
of those illmated marriages thou sawest
where good with bad were matched who of themselves
abhor to join and by imprudence mixed
produce prodigious births of body or mind
such were these giants men of high renown
for in those days might only shall be admired
and valour and heroick virtue called
to overcome in battle and subdue
nations and bring home spoils with infinite
manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch
of human glory and for glory done
of triumph to be styled great conquerours
patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods
destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men
thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth
and what most merits fame in silence hid
but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
the only righteous in a world preverse
and therefore hated therefore so beset
with foes for daring single to be just
and utter odious truth that god would come
to judge them with his saints him the most high
rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
did as thou sawest receive to walk with god
high in salvation and the climes of bliss
exempt from death to show thee what reward
awaits the good the rest what punishment
which now direct thine eyes and soon behold
he looked and saw the face of things quite changed
the brazen throat of war had ceased to roar
all now was turned to jollity and game
to luxury and riot feast and dance
marrying or prostituting as befel
rape or adultery where passing fair
allured them thence from cups to civil broils
at length a reverend sire among them came
and of their doings great dislike declared
and testified against their ways he oft
frequented their assemblies whereso met
triumphs or festivals and to them preached
conversion and repentance as to souls
in prison under judgements imminent
but all in vain which when he saw he ceased
contending and removed his tents far off
then from the mountain hewing timber tall
began to build a vessel of huge bulk
measured by cubit length and breadth and highth
smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
contrived and of provisions laid in large
for man and beast when lo a wonder strange
of every beast and bird and insect small
came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught
their order last the sire and his three sons
with their four wives and god made fast the door
mean while the southwind rose and with black wings
widehovering all the clouds together drove
from under heaven the hills to their supply
vapour and exhalation dusk and moist
sent up amain and now the thickened sky
like a dark ceiling stood down rushed the rain
impetuous and continued till the earth
no more was seen the floating vessel swum
uplifted and secure with beaked prow
rode tilting oer the waves all dwellings else
flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp
deep under water rolled sea covered sea
sea without shore and in their palaces
where luxury late reigned seamonsters whelped
and stabled of mankind so numerous late
all left in one small bottom swum imbarked
how didst thou grieve then adam to behold
the end of all thy offspring end so sad
depopulation thee another flood
of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned
and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared
by the angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last
though comfortless as when a father mourns
his children all in view destroyed at once
and scarce to the angel utterdst thus thy plaint
o visions ill foreseen better had i
lived ignorant of future so had borne
my part of evil only each days lot
enough to bear those now that were dispensed
the burden of many ages on me light
at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
abortive to torment me ere their being
with thought that they must be let no man seek
henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
him or his children evil he may be sure
which neither his foreknowing can prevent
and he the future evil shall no less
in apprehension than in substance feel
grievous to bear but that care now is past
man is not whom to warn those few escaped
famine and anguish will at last consume
wandering that watery desart i had hope
when violence was ceased and war on earth
all would have then gone well peace would have crowned
with length of happy days the race of man
but i was far deceived for now i see
peace to corrupt no less than war to waste
how comes it thus unfold celestial guide
and whether here the race of man will end
to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawest
in triumph and luxurious wealth are they
first seen in acts of prowess eminent
and great exploits but of true virtue void
who having spilt much blood and done much wast
subduing nations and achieved thereby
fame in the world high titles and rich prey
shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth
surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride
raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace
the conquered also and enslaved by war
shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose
and fear of god from whom their piety feigned
in sharp contest of battle found no aid
against invaders therefore cooled in zeal
thenceforth shall practice how to live secure
worldly or dissolute on what their lords
shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear
more than enough that temperance may be tried
so all shall turn degenerate all depraved
justice and temperance truth and faith forgot
one man except the only son of light
in a dark age against example good
against allurement custom and a world
offended fearless of reproach and scorn
or violence he of their wicked ways
shall them admonish and before them set
the paths of righteousness how much more safe
and full of peace denouncing wrath to come
on their impenitence and shall return
of them derided but of god observed
the one just man alive by his command
shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst
to save himself and houshold from amidst
a world devote to universal wrack
no sooner he with them of man and beast
select for life shall in the ark be lodged
and sheltered round but all the cataracts
of heaven set open on the earth shall pour
rain day and night all fountains of the deep
broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
beyond all bounds till inundation rise
above the highest hills then shall this mount
of paradise by might of waves be moved
out of his place pushed by the horned flood
with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift
down the great river to the opening gulf
and there take root an island salt and bare
the haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang
to teach thee that god attributes to place
no sanctity if none be thither brought
by men who there frequent or therein dwell
and now what further shall ensue behold
he looked and saw the ark hull on the flood
which now abated for the clouds were fled
driven by a keen northwind that blowing dry
wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed
and the clear sun on his wide watery glass
gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew
as after thirst which made their flowing shrink
from standing lake to tripping ebb that stole
with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
his sluces as the heaven his windows shut
the ark no more now floats but seems on ground
fast on the top of some high mountain fixed
and now the tops of hills as rocks appear
with clamour thence the rapid currents drive
towards the retreating sea their furious tide
forthwith from out the ark a raven flies
and after him the surer messenger
a dove sent forth once and again to spy
green tree or ground whereon his foot may light
the second time returning in his bill
an oliveleaf he brings pacifick sign
anon dry ground appears and from his ark
the ancient sire descends with all his train
then with uplifted hands and eyes devout
grateful to heaven over his head beholds
a dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
conspicuous with three lifted colours gay
betokening peace from god and covenant new
whereat the heart of adam erst so sad
greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth
o thou who future things canst represent
as present heavenly instructer i revive
at this last sight assured that man shall live
with all the creatures and their seed preserve
far less i now lament for one whole world
of wicked sons destroyed than i rejoice
for one man found so perfect and so just
that god vouchsafes to raise another world
from him and all his anger to forget
but say what mean those coloured streaks in heaven
distended as the brow of god appeased
or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud
lest it again dissolve and shower the earth
to whom the archangel dextrously thou aimest
so willingly doth god remit his ire
though late repenting him of man depraved
grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
corrupting each their way yet those removed
such grace shall one just man find in his sight
that he relents not to blot out mankind
and makes a covenant never to destroy
the earth again by flood nor let the sea
surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
with man therein or beast but when he brings
over the earth a cloud will therein set
his triplecoloured bow whereon to look
and call to mind his covenant day and night
seedtime and harvest heat and hoary frost
shall hold their course till fire purge all things new
both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell







as one who in his journey bates at noon
though bent on speed so here the archangel paused
betwixt the world destroyed and world restored
if adam aught perhaps might interpose
then with transition sweet new speech resumes
thus thou hast seen one world begin and end
and man as from a second stock proceed
much thou hast yet to see but i perceive
thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
must needs impair and weary human sense
henceforth what is to come i will relate
thou therefore give due audience and attend
this second source of men while yet but few
and while the dread of judgement past remains
fresh in their minds fearing the deity
with some regard to what is just and right
shall lead their lives and multiply apace
labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop
corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock
oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid
with large wineofferings poured and sacred feast
shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
long time in peace by families and tribes
under paternal rule till one shall rise
of proud ambitious heart who not content
with fair equality fraternal state
will arrogate dominion undeserved
over his brethren and quite dispossess
concord and law of nature from the earth
hunting 
with war and hostile snare such as refuse
subjection to his empire tyrannous
a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
before the lord as in despite of heaven
or from heaven claiming second sovranty
and from rebellion shall derive his name
though of rebellion others he accuse
he with a crew whom like ambition joins
with him or under him to tyrannize
marching from eden towards the west shall find
the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
boils out from under ground the mouth of hell
of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
a city and tower whose top may reach to heaven
and get themselves a name lest far dispersed
in foreign lands their memory be lost
regardless whether good or evil fame
but god who oft descends to visit men
unseen and through their habitations walks
to mark their doings them beholding soon
comes down to see their city ere the tower
obstruct heaventowers and in derision sets
upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
quite out their native language and instead
to sow a jangling noise of words unknown
forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
among the builders each to other calls
not understood till hoarse and all in rage
as mocked they storm great laughter was in heaven
and looking down to see the hubbub strange
and hear the din thus was the building left
ridiculous and the work confusion named
whereto thus adam fatherly displeased
o execrable son so to aspire
above his brethren to himself assuming
authority usurped from god not given
he gave us only over beast fish fowl
dominion absolute that right we hold
by his donation but man over men
he made not lord such title to himself
reserving human left from human free
but this usurper his encroachment proud
stays not on man to god his tower intends
siege and defiance wretched man what food
will he convey up thither to sustain
himself and his rash army where thin air
above the clouds will pine his entrails gross
and famish him of breath if not of bread
to whom thus michael justly thou abhorrest
that son who on the quiet state of men
such trouble brought affecting to subdue
rational liberty yet know withal
since thy original lapse true liberty
is lost which always with right reason dwells
twinned and from her hath no dividual being
reason in man obscured or not obeyed
immediately inordinate desires
and upstart passions catch the government
from reason and to servitude reduce
man till then free therefore since he permits
within himself unworthy powers to reign
over free reason god in judgement just
subjects him from without to violent lords
who oft as undeservedly enthrall
his outward freedom tyranny must be
though to the tyrant thereby no excuse
yet sometimes nations will decline so low
from virtue which is reason that no wrong
but justice and some fatal curse annexed
deprives them of their outward liberty
their inward lost witness the irreverent son
of him who built the ark who for the shame
done to his father heard this heavy curse
servant of servants on his vicious race
thus will this latter as the former world
still tend from bad to worse till god at last
wearied with their iniquities withdraw
his presence from among them and avert
his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
to leave them to their own polluted ways
and one peculiar nation to select
from all the rest of whom to be invoked
a nation from one faithful man to spring
him on this side euphrates yet residing
bred up in idolworship o that men
 should be so stupid grown
while yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood
as to forsake the living god and fall
to worship their own work in wood and stone
for gods yet him god the most high vouchsafes
to call by vision from his fathers house
his kindred and false gods into a land
which he will show him and from him will raise
a mighty nation and upon him shower
his benediction so that in his seed
all nations shall be blest he straight obeys
not knowing to what land yet firm believes
i see him but thou canst not with what faith
he leaves his gods his friends and native soil
ur of chaldaea passing now the ford
to haran after him a cumbrous train
of herds and flocks and numerous servitude
not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
with god who called him in a land unknown
canaan he now attains i see his tents
pitched about sechem and the neighbouring plain
of moreh there by promise he receives
gift to his progeny of all that land
from hameth northward to the desart south

from hermon east to the great western sea
mount hermon yonder sea each place behold
in prospect as i point them on the shore
mount carmel here the doublefounted stream
jordan true limit eastward but his sons
shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills
this ponder that all nations of the earth
shall in his seed be blessed by that seed
is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise
the serpents head whereof to thee anon
plainlier shall be revealed this patriarch blest
whom faithful abraham due time shall call
a son and of his son a grandchild leaves
like him in faith in wisdom and renown
the grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
from canaan to a land hereafter called
egypt divided by the river nile
see where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
into the sea to sojourn in that land
he comes invited by a younger son
in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
raise him to be the second in that realm
of pharaoh there he dies and leaves his race
growing into a nation and now grown
suspected to a sequent king who seeks
to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
inhospitably and kills their infant males
till by two brethren  sent from god to claim
his people from enthralment they return
with glory and spoil back to their promised land
but first the lawless tyrant who denies
to know their god or message to regard
must be compelled by signs and judgements dire
to blood unshed the rivers must be turned
frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
with loathed intrusion and fill all the land
his cattle must of rot and murren die
botches and blains must all his flesh emboss
and all his people thunder mixed with hail
hail mixed with fire must rend the egyptians sky
and wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls
what it devours not herb or fruit or grain
a darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
must eat and on the ground leave nothing green
darkness must overshadow all his bounds
palpable darkness and blot out three days
last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn
of egypt must lie dead thus with ten wounds
the riverdragon tamed at length submits
to let his sojourners depart and oft
humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
more hardened after thaw till in his rage
pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
swallows him with his host but them lets pass
as on dry land between two crystal walls
awed by the rod of moses so to stand
divided till his rescued gain their shore
such wondrous power god to his saint will lend
though present in his angel who shall go
before them in a cloud and pillar of fire
by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire
to guide them in their journey and remove
behind them while the obdurate king pursues
all night he will pursue but his approach
darkness defends between till morning watch
then through the fiery pillar and the cloud
god looking forth will trouble all his host
and craze their chariotwheels when by command
moses once more his potent rod extends
over the sea the sea his rod obeys
on their embattled ranks the waves return
and overwhelm their war the race elect
safe toward canaan from the shore advance
through the wild desart not the readiest way
lest entering on the canaanite alarmed
war terrify them inexpert and fear
return them back to egypt choosing rather
inglorious life with servitude for life
to noble and ignoble is more sweet
untrained in arms where rashness leads not on
this also shall they gain by their delay
in the wide wilderness there they shall found
their government and their great senate choose
through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained
god from the mount of sinai whose gray top
shall tremble he descending will himself
in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound
ordain them laws part such as appertain
to civil justice part religious rites
of sacrifice informing them by types
and shadows of that destined seed to bruise
the serpent by what means he shall achieve
mankinds deliverance but the voice of god
to mortal ear is dreadful they beseech
that moses might report to them his will
and terrour cease he grants what they besought
instructed that to god is no access
without mediator whose high office now
moses in figure bears to introduce
one greater of whose day he shall foretel
and all the prophets in their age the times
of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites
established such delight hath god in men
obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
among them to set up his tabernacle
the holy one with mortal men to dwell
by his prescript a sanctuary is framed
of cedar overlaid with gold therein
an ark and in the ark his testimony
the records of his covenant over these
a mercyseat of gold between the wings
of two bright cherubim before him burn
seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
the heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night
save when they journey and at length they come
conducted by his angel to the land
promised to abraham and his seedthe rest
were long to tell how many battles fought
how many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still
a day entire and nights due course adjourn
mans voice commanding sun in gibeon stand
and thou moon in the vale of aialon
till israel overcome so call the third
from abraham son of isaac and from him
his whole descent who thus shall canaan win
here adam interposed o sent from heaven
enlightener of my darkness gracious things
thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
just abraham and his seed now first i find
mine eyes trueopening and my heart much eased
erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
of me and all mankind but now i see
his day in whom all nations shall be blest
favour unmerited by me who sought
forbidden knowledge by forbidden means
this yet i apprehend not why to those
among whom god will deign to dwell on earth
so many and so various laws are given
so many laws argue so many sins
among them how can god with such reside
to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
will reign among them as of thee begot
and therefore was law given them to evince
their natural pravity by stirring up
sin against law to fight that when they see
law can discover sin but not remove
save by those shadowy expiations weak
the blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
some blood more precious must be paid for man
just for unjust that in such righteousness
to them by faith imputed they may find
justification towards god and peace
of conscience which the law by ceremonies
cannot appease nor man the mortal part
perform and not performing cannot live
so law appears imperfect and but given
with purpose to resign them in full time
up to a better covenant disciplined
from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit
from imposition of strict laws to free
acceptance of large grace from servile fear
to filial works of law to works of faith
and therefore shall not moses though of god
highly beloved being but the minister
of law his people into canaan lead
but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call
his name and office bearing who shall quell
the adversaryserpent and bring back
through the worlds wilderness longwandered man
safe to eternal paradise of rest
mean while they in their earthly canaan placed
long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
national interrupt their publick peace
provoking god to raise them enemies
from whom as oft he saves them penitent
by judges first then under kings of whom
the second both for piety renowned
and puissant deeds a promise shall receive
irrevocable that his regal throne
for ever shall endure the like shall sing
all prophecy that of the royal stock
of david  shall rise
a son the womans seed to thee foretold
foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust
all nations and to kings foretold of kings
the last for of his reign shall be no end
but first a long succession must ensue
and his next son for wealth and wisdom famed
the clouded ark of god till then in tents
wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine
such follow him as shall be registered
part good part bad of bad the longer scroll
whose foul idolatries and other faults
heaped to the popular sum will so incense
god as to leave them and expose their land
their city his temple and his holy ark
with all his sacred things a scorn and prey
to that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
left in confusion babylon thence called
there in captivity he lets them dwell
the space of seventy years then brings them back
remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
to david stablished as the days of heaven
returned from babylon by leave of kings
their lords whom god disposed the house of god
they first reedify and for a while
in mean estate live moderate till grown
in wealth and multitude factious they grow
but first among the priests dissention springs
men who attend the altar and should most
endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
upon the temple itself at last they seise
the scepter and regard not davids sons
then lose it to a stranger that the true
anointed king messiah might be born
barred of his right yet at his birth a star
unseen before in heaven proclaims him come
and guides the eastern sages who inquire
his place to offer incense myrrh and gold
his place of birth a solemn angel tells
to simple shepherds keeping watch by night
they gladly thither haste and by a quire
of squadroned angels hear his carol sung
a virgin is his mother but his sire
the power of the most high he shall ascend
the throne hereditary and bound his reign
with earths wide bounds his glory with the heavens
he ceased discerning adam with such joy
surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears
without the vent of words which these he breathed
o prophet of glad tidings finisher
of utmost hope now clear i understand
what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain
why our great expectation should be called
the seed of woman virgin mother hail
high in the love of heaven yet from my loins
thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
of god most high so god with man unites
needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
expect with mortal pain say where and when
their fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel
to whom thus michael dream not of their fight
as of a duel or the local wounds
of head or heel not therefore joins the son
manhood to godhead with more strength to foil
thy enemy nor so is overcome
satan whose fall from heaven a deadlier bruise
disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound
which he who comes thy saviour shall recure
not by destroying satan but his works
in thee and in thy seed nor can this be
but by fulfilling that which thou didst want
obedience to the law of god imposed
on penalty of death and suffering death
the penalty to thy transgression due
and due to theirs which out of thine will grow
so only can high justice rest appaid
the law of god exact he shall fulfil
both by obedience and by love though love
alone fulfil the law thy punishment
he shall endure by coming in the flesh
to a reproachful life and cursed death
proclaiming life to all who shall believe
in his redemption and that his obedience
imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
to save them not their own though legal works
for this he shall live hated be blasphemed
seised on by force judged and to death condemned
a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
by his own nation slain for bringing life
but to the cross he nails thy enemies
the law that is against thee and the sins
of all mankind with him there crucified
never to hurt them more who rightly trust
in this his satisfaction so he dies
but soon revives death over him no power
shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
return the stars of morn shall see him rise
out of his grave fresh as the dawning light
thy ransom paid which man from death redeems
his death for man as many as offered life
neglect not and the benefit embrace
by faith not void of works this godlike act
annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died
in sin for ever lost from life this act
shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength
defeating sin and death his two main arms
and fix far deeper in his head their stings
than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel
or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep
a gentle wafting to immortal life
nor after resurrection shall he stay
longer on earth than certain times to appear
to his disciples men who in his life
still followed him to them shall leave in charge
to teach all nations what of him they learned
and his salvation them who shall believe
baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
of washing them from guilt of sin to life
pure and in mind prepared if so befall
for death like that which the redeemer died
all nations they shall teach for from that day
not only to the sons of abrahams loins
salvation shall be preached but to the sons
of abrahams faith wherever through the world
so in his seed all nations shall be blest
then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascend
with victory triumphing through the air
over his foes and thine there shall surprise
the serpent prince of air and drag in chains
through all his realm and there confounded leave
then enter into glory and resume
his seat at gods right hand exalted high
above all names in heaven and thence shall come
when this worlds dissolution shall be ripe
with glory and power to judge both quick and dead
to judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
his faithful and receive them into bliss
whether in heaven or earth for then the earth
shall all be paradise far happier place
than this of eden and far happier days
so spake the archangel michael then paused
as at the worlds great period and our sire
replete with joy and wonder thus replied
o goodness infinite goodness immense
that all this good of evil shall produce
and evil turn to good more wonderful
than that which by creation first brought forth
light out of darkness full of doubt i stand
whether i should repent me now of sin
by me done and occasioned or rejoice
much more that much more good thereof shall spring
to god more glory more goodwill to men
from god and over wrath grace shall abound
but say if our deliverer up to heaven
must reascend what will betide the few
his faithful left among the unfaithful herd
the enemies of truth who then shall guide
his people who defend will they not deal
worse with his followers than with him they dealt
be sure they will said the angel but from heaven
he to his own a comforter will send
the promise of the father who shall dwell
his spirit within them and the law of faith
working through love upon their hearts shall write
to guide them in all truth and also arm
with spiritual armour able to resist
satans assaults and quench his fiery darts
what man can do against them not afraid
though to the death against such cruelties
with inward consolations recompensed
and oft supported so as shall amaze
their proudest persecutors for the spirit
poured first on his apostles whom he sends
to evangelize the nations then on all
baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
to speak all tongues and do all miracles
as did their lord before them thus they win
great numbers of each nation to receive
with joy the tidings brought from heaven at length
their ministry performed and race well run
their doctrine and their story written left
they die but in their room as they forewarn
wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves
who all the sacred mysteries of heaven
to their own vile advantages shall turn
of lucre and ambition and the truth
with superstitions and traditions taint
left only in those written records pure
though not but by the spirit understood
then shall they seek to avail themselves of names
places and titles and with these to join
secular power though feigning still to act
by spiritual to themselves appropriating
the spirit of god promised alike and given
to all believers and from that pretence
spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
on every conscience laws which none shall find
left them inrolled or what the spirit within
shall on the heart engrave what will they then
but force the spirit of grace itself and bind
his consort liberty what but unbuild
his living temples built by faith to stand
their own faith not anothers for on earth
who against faith and conscience can be heard
infallible yet many will presume
whence heavy persecution shall arise
on all who in the worship persevere
of spirit and truth the rest far greater part
will deem in outward rites and specious forms
religion satisfied truth shall retire
bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
rarely be found so shall the world go on
to good malignant to bad men benign
under her own weight groaning till the day
appear of respiration to the just
and vengeance to the wicked at return
of him so lately promised to thy aid
the womans seed obscurely then foretold
now ampler known thy saviour and thy lord
last in the clouds from heaven to be revealed
in glory of the father to dissolve
satan with his perverted world then raise
from the conflagrant mass purged and refined
new heavens new earth ages of endless date
founded in righteousness and peace and love
to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss
he ended and thus adam last replied
how soon hath thy prediction seer blest
measured this transient world the race of time
till time stand fixed beyond is all abyss
eternity whose end no eye can reach
greatlyinstructed i shall hence depart
greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
of knowledge what this vessel can contain
beyond which was my folly to aspire
henceforth i learn that to obey is best
and love with fear the only god to walk
as in his presence ever to observe
his providence and on him sole depend
merciful over all his works with good
still overcoming evil and by small
accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
by simply meek that suffering for truths sake
is fortitude to highest victory
and to the faithful death the gate of life
taught this by his example whom i now
acknowledge my redeemer ever blest
to whom thus also the angel last replied
this having learned thou hast attained the sum
of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers
all secrets of the deep all natures works
or works of god in heaven air earth or sea
and all the riches of this world enjoyedst
and all the rule one empire only add
deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith
add virtue patience temperance add love
by name to come called charity the soul
of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
to leave this paradise but shalt possess
a paradise within thee happier far
let us descend now therefore from this top
of speculation for the hour precise
exacts our parting hence and see the guards
by me encamped on yonder hill expect
their motion at whose front a flaming sword
in signal of remove waves fiercely round
we may no longer stay go waken eve
her also i with gentle dreams have calmed
portending good and all her spirits composed
to meek submission thou at season fit
let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
chiefly what may concern her faith to know
the great deliverance by her seed to come
 on all mankind
that ye may live which will be many days
both in one faith unanimous though sad
with cause for evils past yet much more cheered
with meditation on the happy end
he ended and they both descend the hill
descended adam to the bower where eve
lay sleeping ran before but found her waked
and thus with words not sad she him received
whence thou returnest and whither wentest i know
for god is also in sleep and dreams advise
which he hath sent propitious some great good
presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
wearied i fell asleep but now lead on
in me is no delay with thee to go
is to stay here without thee here to stay
is to go hence unwilling thou to me
art all things under heaven all places thou
who for my wilful crime art banished hence
this further consolation yet secure
i carry hence though all by me is lost
such favour i unworthy am vouchsafed
by me the promised seed shall all restore
so spake our mother eve and adam heard
well pleased but answered not for now too nigh
the archangel stood and from the other hill
to their fixed station all in bright array
the cherubim descended on the ground
gliding meteorous as eveningmist
risen from a river oer the marish glides
and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
homeward returning high in front advanced
the brandished sword of god before them blazed
fierce as a comet which with torrid heat
and vapour as the libyan air adust
began to parch that temperate clime whereat
in either hand the hastening angel caught
our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
led them direct and down the cliff as fast
to the subjected plain then disappeared
they looking back all the eastern side beheld
of paradise so late their happy seat
waved over by that flaming brand the gate
with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms
some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon
the world was all before them where to choose
their place of rest and providence their guide
they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
through eden took their solitary way


      arms and the man i sing who forcd by fate
      and haughty junos unrelenting hate
      expelld and exild left the trojan shore
      long labours both by sea and land he bore
      and in the doubtful war before he won
      the latian realm and built the destind town
      his banishd gods restord to rites divine
      and settled sure succession in his line
      from whence the race of alban fathers come
      and the long glories of majestic rome
      o muse the causes and the crimes relate
      what goddess was provokd and whence her hate
      for what offence the queen of heavn began
      to persecute so brave so just a man
      involvd his anxious life in endless cares
      exposd to wants and hurried into wars
      can heavnly minds such high resentment show
      or exercise their spite in human woe

      against the tibers mouth but far away
      an ancient town was seated on the sea
      a tyrian colony the people made
      stout for the war and studious of their trade
      carthage the name belovd by juno more
      than her own argos or the samian shore
      here stood her chariot here if heavn were kind
      the seat of awful empire she designd
      yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly
      
      that times to come should see the trojan race
      her carthage ruin and her towrs deface
      nor thus confind the yoke of sovreign sway
      should on the necks of all the nations lay
      she ponderd this and feard it was in fate
      nor could forget the war she wagd of late
      for conquring greece against the trojan state
      besides long causes working in her mind
      and secret seeds of envy lay behind
      deep graven in her heart the doom remaind
      of partial paris and her form disdaind
      the grace bestowd on ravishd ganymed
      electras glories and her injurd bed
      each was a cause alone and all combind
      to kindle vengeance in her haughty mind
      for this far distant from the latian coast
      she drove the remnants of the trojan host
      and sevn long years th unhappy wandring train
      were tossd by storms and scatterd thro the main
      such time such toil requird the roman name
      such length of labour for so vast a frame

      now scarce the trojan fleet with sails and oars
      had left behind the fair sicilian shores
      entring with cheerful shouts the watry reign
      and plowing frothy furrows in the main
      when labring still with endless discontent
      the queen of heavn did thus her fury vent

      then am i vanquishd must i yield said she
      and must the trojans reign in italy
      so fate will have it and jove adds his force
      nor can my powr divert their happy course
      could angry pallas with revengeful spleen
      the grecian navy burn and drown the men
      she for the fault of one offending foe
      the bolts of jove himself presumd to throw
      with whirlwinds from beneath she tossd the ship
      and bare exposd the bosom of the deep
      then as an eagle gripes the trembling game
      the wretch yet hissing with her fathers flame
      she strongly seizd and with a burning wound
      transfixd and naked on a rock she bound
      but i who walk in awful state above
      the majesty of heavn the sister wife of jove
      for length of years my fruitless force employ
      against the thin remains of ruind troy
      what nations now to junos powr will pray
      or offrings on my slighted altars lay

      thus ragd the goddess and with fury fraught
      the restless regions of the storms she sought
      where in a spacious cave of living stone
      the tyrant aeolus from his airy throne
      with powr imperial curbs the struggling winds
      and sounding tempests in dark prisons binds
      this way and that th impatient captives tend
      and pressing for release the mountains rend
      high in his hall th undaunted monarch stands
      and shakes his scepter and their rage commands
      which did he not their unresisted sway
      would sweep the world before them in their way
      earth air and seas thro empty space would roll
      and heavn would fly before the driving soul
      in fear of this the father of the gods
      confind their fury to those dark abodes
      and lockd em safe within oppressd with mountain loads
      imposd a king with arbitrary sway
      to loose their fetters or their force allay
      to whom the suppliant queen her prayrs addressd
      and thus the tenor of her suit expressd

      o aeolus for to thee the king of heavn
      the powr of tempests and of winds has givn
      thy force alone their fury can restrain
      and smooth the waves or swell the troubled main
      a race of wandring slaves abhorrd by me
      with prosprous passage cut the tuscan sea
      to fruitful italy their course they steer
      and for their vanquishd gods design new temples there
      raise all thy winds with night involve the skies
      sink or disperse my fatal enemies
      twice sevn the charming daughters of the main
      around my person wait and bear my train
      succeed my wish and second my design
      the fairest deiopeia shall be thine
      and make thee father of a happy line

      to this the god tis yours o queen to will
      the work which duty binds me to fulfil
      these airy kingdoms and this wide command
      are all the presents of your bounteous hand
      yours is my sovreigns grace and as your guest
      i sit with gods at their celestial feast
      raise tempests at your pleasure or subdue
      dispose of empire which i hold from you

      he said and hurld against the mountain side
      his quivring spear and all the god applied
      the raging winds rush thro the hollow wound
      and dance aloft in air and skim along the ground
      then settling on the sea the surges sweep
      raise liquid mountains and disclose the deep
      south east and west with mixd confusion roar
      and roll the foaming billows to the shore
      the cables crack the sailors fearful cries
      ascend and sable night involves the skies
      and heavn itself is ravishd from their eyes
      loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue
      then flashing fires the transient light renew
      the face of things a frightful image bears
      and present death in various forms appears
      struck with unusual fright the trojan chief
      with lifted hands and eyes invokes relief
      and thrice and four times happy those he cried
      that under ilian walls before their parents died
      tydides bravest of the grecian train
      why could not i by that strong arm be slain
      and lie by noble hector on the plain
      or great sarpedon in those bloody fields
      where simois rolls the bodies and the shields
      of heroes whose dismemberd hands yet bear
      the dart aloft and clench the pointed spear

      thus while the pious prince his fate bewails
      fierce boreas drove against his flying sails
      and rent the sheets the raging billows rise
      and mount the tossing vessels to the skies
      nor can the shivring oars sustain the blow
      the galley gives her side and turns her prow
      while those astern descending down the steep
      thro gaping waves behold the boiling deep
      three ships were hurried by the southern blast
      and on the secret shelves with fury cast
      those hidden rocks th ausonian sailors knew
      they calld them altars when they rose in view
      and showd their spacious backs above the flood
      three more fierce eurus in his angry mood
      dashd on the shallows of the moving sand
      and in mid ocean left them moord aland
      orontes bark that bore the lycian crew
       evn in the heros view
      from stem to stern by waves was overborne
      the trembling pilot from his rudder torn
      was headlong hurld thrice round the ship was tossd
      then bulgd at once and in the deep was lost
      and here and there above the waves were seen
      arms pictures precious goods and floating men
      the stoutest vessel to the storm gave way
      and suckd thro loosend planks the rushing sea
      ilioneus was her chief alethes old
      achates faithful abas young and bold
      endurd not less their ships with gaping seams
      admit the deluge of the briny streams

      meantime imperial neptune heard the sound
      of raging billows breaking on the ground
      displeasd and fearing for his watry reign
      he reard his awful head above the main
      serene in majesty then rolld his eyes
      around the space of earth and seas and skies
      he saw the trojan fleet dispersd distressd
      by stormy winds and wintry heavn oppressd
      full well the god his sisters envy knew
      and what her aims and what her arts pursue
      he summond eurus and the western blast
      and first an angry glance on both he cast
      then thus rebukd audacious winds from whence
      this bold attempt this rebel insolence
      is it for you to ravage seas and land
      unauthorizd by my supreme command
      to raise such mountains on the troubled main
      whom ibut first tis fit the billows to restrain
      and then you shall be taught obedience to my reign
      hence to your lord my royal mandate bear
      the realms of ocean and the fields of air
      are mine not his by fatal lot to me
      the liquid empire fell and trident of the sea
      his powr to hollow caverns is confind
      there let him reign the jailer of the wind
      with hoarse commands his breathing subjects call
      and boast and bluster in his empty hall
      he spoke and while he spoke he smoothd the sea
      dispelld the darkness and restord the day
      cymothoe triton and the seagreen train
      of beauteous nymphs the daughters of the main
      clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands
      the god himself with ready trident stands
      and opes the deep and spreads the moving sands
      then heaves them off the shoals whereer he guides
      his finny coursers and in triumph rides
      the waves unruffle and the sea subsides
      as when in tumults rise th ignoble crowd
      mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
      and stones and brands in rattling volleys fly
      and all the rustic arms that fury can supply
      if then some grave and pious man appear
      they hush their noise and lend a listning ear
      he soothes with sober words their angry mood
      and quenches their innate desire of blood
      so when the father of the flood appears
      and oer the seas his sovreign trident rears
      their fury falls he skims the liquid plains
      high on his chariot and with loosend reins
      majestic moves along and awful peace maintains
      the weary trojans ply their shatterd oars
      to nearest land and make the libyan shores

      within a long recess there lies a bay
      an island shades it from the rolling sea
      and forms a port secure for ships to ride
      broke by the jutting land on either side
      in double streams the briny waters glide
      betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
      appears above and groves for ever green
      a grot is formd beneath with mossy seats
      to rest the nereids and exclude the heats
      down thro the crannies of the living walls
      the crystal streams descend in murmring falls
      no haulsers need to bind the vessels here
      nor bearded anchors for no storms they fear
      sevn ships within this happy harbour meet
      the thin remainders of the scatterd fleet
      the trojans worn with toils and spent with woes
      leap on the welcome land and seek their wishd repose

      first good achates with repeated strokes
      of clashing flints their hidden fire provokes
      short flame succeeds a bed of witherd leaves
      the dying sparkles in their fall receives
      caught into life in fiery fumes they rise
      and fed with stronger food invade the skies
      the trojans dropping wet or stand around
      the cheerful blaze or lie along the ground
      some dry their corn infected with the brine
      then grind with marbles and prepare to dine
      aeneas climbs the mountains airy brow
      and takes a prospect of the seas below
      if capys thence or antheus he could spy
      or see the streamers of caicus fly
      no vessels were in view but on the plain
      three beamy stags command a lordly train
      of branching heads the more ignoble throng
      attend their stately steps and slowly graze along
      he stood and while secure they fed below
      he took the quiver and the trusty bow
      achates usd to bear the leaders first
      he laid along and then the vulgar piercd
      nor ceasd his arrows till the shady plain
      sevn mighty bodies with their blood distain
      for the sevn ships he made an equal share
      and to the port returnd triumphant from the war
      the jars of genrous wine 
      he set abroach and for the feast prepard
      in equal portions with the venson shard
      thus while he dealt it round the pious chief
      with cheerful words allayd the common grief
      endure and conquer jove will soon dispose
      to future good our past and present woes
      with me the rocks of scylla you have tried
      th inhuman cyclops and his den defied
      what greater ills hereafter can you bear
      resume your courage and dismiss your care
      an hour will come with pleasure to relate
      your sorrows past as benefits of fate
      thro various hazards and events we move
      to latium and the realms foredoomd by jove
      calld to the seat 
      where trojan kingdoms once again may rise
      endure the hardships of your present state
      live and reserve yourselves for better fate

      these words he spoke but spoke not from his heart
      his outward smiles conceald his inward smart
      the jolly crew unmindful of the past
      the quarry share their plenteous dinner haste
      some strip the skin some portion out the spoil
      the limbs yet trembling in the caldrons boil
      some on the fire the reeking entrails broil
      stretchd on the grassy turf at ease they dine
      restore their strength with meat and cheer their souls with
      wine
      their hunger thus appeasd their care attends
      the doubtful fortune of their absent friends
      alternate hopes and fears their minds possess
      whether to deem em dead or in distress
      above the rest aeneas mourns the fate
      of brave orontes and th uncertain state
      of gyas lycus and of amycus
      the day but not their sorrows ended thus

      when from aloft almighty jove surveys
      earth air and shores and navigable seas
      at length on libyan realms he fixd his eyes
      whom pondring thus on human miseries
      when venus saw she with a lowly look
      not free from tears her heavnly sire bespoke

      o king of gods and men whose awful hand
      disperses thunder on the seas and land
      disposing all with absolute command
      how could my pious son thy powr incense
      or what alas is vanishd troys offence
      our hope of italy not only lost
      on various seas by various tempests tossd
      but shut from evry shore and barrd from evry coast
      you promisd once a progeny divine
      of romans rising from the trojan line
      in after times should hold the world in awe
      and to the land and ocean give the law
      how is your doom reversd which easd my care
      when troy was ruind in that cruel war
      then fates to fates i could oppose but now
      when fortune still pursues her former blow
      what can i hope what worse can still succeed
      what end of labours has your will decreed
      antenor from the midst of grecian hosts
      could pass secure and pierce th illyrian coasts
      where rolling down the steep timavus raves
      and thro nine channels disembogues his waves
      at length he founded paduas happy seat
      and gave his trojans a secure retreat
      there fixd their arms and there renewd their name
      and there in quiet rules and crownd with fame
      but we descended from your sacred line
      entitled to your heavn and rites divine
      are banishd earth and for the wrath of one
      removd from latium and the promisd throne
      are these our scepters these our due rewards
      and is it thus that jove his plighted faith regards

      to whom the father of th immortal race
      smiling with that serene indulgent face
      with which he drives the clouds and clears the skies
      first gave a holy kiss then thus replies

      daughter dismiss thy fears to thy desire
      the fates of thine are fixd and stand entire
      thou shalt behold thy wishd lavinian walls
      and ripe for heavn when fate aeneas calls
      then shalt thou bear him up sublime to me
      no councils have reversd my firm decree
      and lest new fears disturb thy happy state
      know i have searchd the mystic rolls of fate
      thy son 
      in italy shall wage successful war
      shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field
      and sovreign laws impose and cities build
      till after evry foe subdued the sun
      thrice thro the signs his annual race shall run
      this is his time prefixd ascanius then
      now calld iulus shall begin his reign
      he thirty rolling years the crown shall wear
      then from lavinium shall the seat transfer
      and with hard labour alba longa build
      the throne with his succession shall be filld
      three hundred circuits more then shall be seen
      ilia the fair a priestess and a queen
      who full of mars in time with kindly throes
      shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose
      the royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain
      then romulus his grandsires throne shall gain
      of martial towrs the founder shall become
      the people romans call the city rome
      to them no bounds of empire i assign
      nor term of years to their immortal line
      evn haughty juno who with endless broils
      earth seas and heavn and jove himself turmoils
      at length atond her friendly powr shall join
      to cherish and advance the trojan line
      the subject world shall romes dominion own
      and prostrate shall adore the nation of the gown
      an age is ripening in revolving fate
      when troy shall overturn the grecian state
      and sweet revenge her conquring sons shall call
      to crush the people that conspird her fall
      then caesar from the julian stock shall rise
      whose empire ocean and whose fame the skies
      alone shall bound whom fraught with eastern spoils
      our heavn the just reward of human toils
      securely shall repay with rites divine
      and incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine
      then dire debate and impious war shall cease
      and the stern age be softend into peace
      then banishd faith shall once again return
      and vestal fires in hallowd temples burn
      and remus with quirinus shall sustain
      the righteous laws and fraud and force restrain
      janus himself before his fane shall wait
      and keep the dreadful issues of his gate
      with bolts and iron bars within remains
      imprisond fury bound in brazen chains
      high on a trophy raisd of useless arms
      he sits and threats the world with vain alarms

      he said and sent cyllenius with command
      to free the ports and ope the punic land
      to trojan guests lest ignorant of fate
      the queen might force them from her town and state
      down from the steep of heavn cyllenius flies
      and cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies
      soon on the libyan shore descends the god
      performs his message and displays his rod
      the surly murmurs of the people cease
      and as the fates requird they give the peace
      the queen herself suspends the rigid laws
      the trojans pities and protects their cause

      meantime in shades of night aeneas lies
      care seizd his soul and sleep forsook his eyes
      but when the sun restord the cheerful day
      he rose the coast and country to survey
      anxious and eager to discover more
      it lookd a wild uncultivated shore
      but whether humankind or beasts alone
      possessd the newfound region was unknown
      beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides
      tall trees surround the mountains shady sides
      the bending brow above a safe retreat provides
      armd with two pointed darts he leaves his friends
      and true achates on his steps attends
      lo in the deep recesses of the wood
      before his eyes his goddess mother stood
      a huntress in her habit and her mien
      her dress a maid her air confessd a queen
      bare were her knees and knots her garments bind
      loose was her hair and wantond in the wind
      her hand sustaind a bow her quiver hung behind
      she seemd a virgin of the spartan blood
      with such array harpalyce bestrode
      her thracian courser and outstrippd the rapid flood
      ho strangers have you lately seen she said
      one of my sisters like myself arrayd
      who crossd the lawn or in the forest strayd
      a painted quiver at her back she bore
      varied with spots a lynxs hide she wore
      and at full cry pursued the tusky boar

      thus venus thus her son replied again
      none of your sisters have we heard or seen
      o virgin or what other name you bear
      above that style o more than mortal fair
      your voice and mien celestial birth betray
      if as you seem the sister of the day
      or one at least of chaste dianas train
      let not an humble suppliant sue in vain
      but tell a stranger long in tempests tossd
      what earth we tread and who commands the coast
      then on your name shall wretched mortals call
      and offerd victims at your altars fall
      i dare not she replied assume the name
      of goddess or celestial honours claim
      for tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear
      and purple buskins oer their ankles wear
      know gentle youth in libyan lands you are
      a people rude in peace and rough in war
      the rising city which from far you see
      is carthage and a tyrian colony
      phoenician dido rules the growing state
      who fled from tyre to shun her brothers hate
      great were her wrongs her story full of fate
      which i will sum in short sichaeus known
      for wealth and brother to the punic throne
      possessd fair didos bed and either heart
      at once was wounded with an equal dart
      her father gave her yet a spotless maid
      pygmalion then the tyrian scepter swayd
      one who condemnd divine and human laws
      then strife ensued and cursed gold the cause
      the monarch blinded with desire of wealth
      with steel invades his brothers life by stealth
      before the sacred altar made him bleed
      and long from her conceald the cruel deed
      some tale some new pretence he daily coind
      to soothe his sister and delude her mind
      at length in dead of night the ghost appears
      of her unhappy lord the spectre stares
      and with erected eyes his bloody bosom bares
      the cruel altars and his fate he tells
      and the dire secret of his house reveals
      then warns the widow with her household gods
      to seek a refuge in remote abodes
      last to support her in so long a way
      he shows her where his hidden treasure lay
      admonishd thus and seizd with mortal fright
      the queen provides companions of her flight
      they meet and all combine to leave the state
      who hate the tyrant or who fear his hate
      they seize a fleet which ready riggd they find
      nor is pygmalions treasure left behind
      the vessels heavy laden put to sea
      with prosprous winds a woman leads the way
      i know not if by stress of weather drivn
      or was their fatal course disposd by heavn
      at last they landed where from far your eyes
      may view the turrets of new carthage rise
      there bought a space of ground which byrsa calld
      from the bulls hide they first inclosd and walld
      but whence are you what country claims your birth
      what seek you strangers on our libyan earth

      to whom with sorrow streaming from his eyes
      and deeply sighing thus her son replies
      could you with patience hear or i relate
      o nymph the tedious annals of our fate
      thro such a train of woes if i should run
      the day would sooner than the tale be done
      from ancient troy by force expelld we came
      if you by chance have heard the trojan name
      on various seas by various tempests tossd
      at length we landed on your libyan coast
      the good aeneas am i calld a name
      while fortune favourd not unknown to fame
      my household gods companions of my woes
      with pious care i rescued from our foes
      to fruitful italy my course was bent
      and from the king of heavn is my descent
      with twice ten sail i crossd the phrygian sea
      fate and my mother goddess led my way
      scarce sevn the thin remainders of my fleet
      from storms preservd within your harbour meet
      myself distressd an exile and unknown
      debarrd from europe and from asia thrown
      in libyan deserts wander thus alone

      his tender parent could no longer bear
      but interposing sought to soothe his care
      whoeer you are not unbelovd by heavn
      since on our friendly shore your ships are drivn
      have courage to the gods permit the rest
      and to the queen expose your just request
      now take this earnest of success for more
      your scatterd fleet is joind upon the shore
      the winds are changd your friends from danger free
      or i renounce my skill in augury
      twelve swans behold in beauteous order move
      and stoop with closing pinions from above
      whom late the bird of jove had drivn along
      and thro the clouds pursued the scattring throng
      now all united in a goodly team
      they skim the ground and seek the quiet stream
      as they with joy returning clap their wings
      and ride the circuit of the skies in rings
      not otherwise your ships and evry friend
      already hold the port or with swift sails descend
      no more advice is needful but pursue
      the path before you and the town in view

      thus having said she turnd and made appear
      her neck refulgent and disheveld hair
      which flowing from her shoulders reachd the ground
      and widely spread ambrosial scents around
      in length of train descends her sweeping gown
      and by her graceful walk the queen of love is known
      the prince pursued the parting deity
      with words like these ah whither do you fly
      unkind and cruel to deceive your son
      in borrowd shapes and his embrace to shun
      never to bless my sight but thus unknown
      and still to speak in accents not your own
      against the goddess these complaints he made
      but took the path and her commands obeyd
      they march obscure for venus kindly shrouds
      with mists their persons and involves in clouds
      that thus unseen their passage none might stay
      or force to tell the causes of their way
      this part performd the goddess flies sublime
      to visit paphos and her native clime
      where garlands ever green and ever fair
      with vows are offerd and with solemn prayr
      a hundred altars in her temple smoke
      a thousand bleeding hearts her powr invoke

      they climb the next ascent and looking down
      now at a nearer distance view the town
      the prince with wonder sees the stately towrs
      which late were huts and shepherds homely bowrs
      the gates and streets and hears from evry part
      the noise and busy concourse of the mart
      the toiling tyrians on each other call
      to ply their labour some extend the wall
      some build the citadel the brawny throng
      or dig or push unwieldly stones along
      some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground
      which first designd with ditches they surround
      some laws ordain and some attend the choice
      of holy senates and elect by voice
      here some design a mole while others there
      lay deep foundations for a theatre
      from marble quarries mighty columns hew
      for ornaments of scenes and future view
      such is their toil and such their busy pains
      as exercise the bees in flowry plains
      when winter past and summer scarce begun
      invites them forth to labour in the sun
      some lead their youth abroad while some condense
      their liquid store and some in cells dispense
      some at the gate stand ready to receive
      the golden burthen and their friends relieve
      all with united force combine to drive
      the lazy drones from the laborious hive
      with envy stung they view each others deeds
      the fragrant work with diligence proceeds
      thrice happy you whose walls already rise
      aeneas said and viewd with lifted eyes
      their lofty towrs then entring at the gate
      conceald in clouds 
      he mixd unmarkd among the busy throng
      borne by the tide and passd unseen along

      full in the centre of the town there stood
      thick set with trees a venerable wood
      the tyrians landing near this holy ground
      and digging here a prosprous omen found
      from under earth a coursers head they drew
      their growth and future fortune to foreshew
      this fated sign their foundress juno gave
      of a soil fruitful and a people brave
      sidonian dido here with solemn state
      did junos temple build and consecrate
      enrichd with gifts and with a golden shrine
      but more the goddess made the place divine
      on brazen steps the marble threshold rose
      and brazen plates the cedar beams inclose
      the rafters are with brazen covrings crownd
      the lofty doors on brazen hinges sound
      what first aeneas in this place beheld
      revivd his courage and his fear expelld
      for while expecting there the queen he raisd
      his wondring eyes and round the temple gazd
      admird the fortune of the rising town
      the striving artists and their arts renown
      he saw in order painted on the wall
      whatever did unhappy troy befall
      the wars that fame around the world had blown
      all to the life and evry leader known
      there agamemnon priam here he spies
      and fierce achilles who both kings defies
      he stoppd and weeping said o friend evn here
      the monuments of trojan woes appear
      our known disasters fill evn foreign lands
      see there where old unhappy priam stands
      evn the mute walls relate the warriors fame
      and trojan griefs the tyrians pity claim
      he said his tears a ready passage find
      devouring what he saw so well designd
      and with an empty picture fed his mind
      for there he saw the fainting grecians yield
      and here the trembling trojans quit the field
      pursued by fierce achilles thro the plain
      on his high chariot driving oer the slain
      the tents of rhesus next his grief renew
      by their white sails betrayd to nightly view
      and wakeful diomede whose cruel sword
      the sentries slew nor spard their slumbring lord
      then took the fiery steeds ere yet the food
      of troy they taste or drink the xanthian flood
      elsewhere he saw where troilus defied
      achilles and unequal combat tried
      then where the boy disarmd with loosend reins
      was by his horses hurried oer the plains
      hung by the neck and hair and draggd around
      the hostile spear yet sticking in his wound
      with tracks of blood inscribd the dusty ground
      meantime the trojan dames oppressd with woe
      to pallas fane in long procession go
      in hopes to reconcile their heavnly foe
      they weep they beat their breasts they rend their hair
      and rich embroiderd vests for presents bear
      but the stern goddess stands unmovd with prayr
      thrice round the trojan walls achilles drew
      the corpse of hector whom in fight he slew
      here priam sues and there for sums of gold
      the lifeless body of his son is sold
      so sad an object and so well expressd
      drew sighs and groans from the grievd heros breast
      to see the figure of his lifeless friend
      and his old sire his helpless hand extend
      himself he saw amidst the grecian train
      mixd in the bloody battle on the plain
      and swarthy memnon in his arms he knew
      his pompous ensigns and his indian crew
      penthisilea there with haughty grace
      leads to the wars an amazonian race
      in their right hands a pointed dart they wield
      the left for ward sustains the lunar shield
      athwart her breast a golden belt she throws
      amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes
      and dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose

      thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes
      fixd on the walls with wonder and surprise
      the beauteous dido with a numrous train
      and pomp of guards ascends the sacred fane
      such on eurotas banks or cynthus height
      diana seems and so she charms the sight
      when in the dance the graceful goddess leads
      the choir of nymphs and overtops their heads
      known by her quiver and her lofty mien
      she walks majestic and she looks their queen
      latona sees her shine above the rest
      and feeds with secret joy her silent breast
      such dido was with such becoming state
      amidst the crowd she walks serenely great
      their labour to her future sway she speeds
      and passing with a gracious glance proceeds
      then mounts the throne high placd before the shrine
      in crowds around the swarming people join
      she takes petitions and dispenses laws
      hears and determines evry private cause
      their tasks in equal portions she divides
      and where unequal there by lots decides
      another way by chance aeneas bends
      his eyes and unexpected sees his friends
      antheus sergestus grave cloanthus strong
      and at their backs a mighty trojan throng
      whom late the tempest on the billows tossd
      and widely scatterd on another coast
      the prince unseen surprisd with wonder stands
      and longs with joyful haste to join their hands
      but doubtful of the wishd event he stays
      and from the hollow cloud his friends surveys
      impatient till they told their present state
      and where they left their ships and what their fate
      and why they came and what was their request
      for these were sent commissiond by the rest
      to sue for leave to land their sickly men
      and gain admission to the gracious queen
      entring with cries they filld the holy fane
      then thus with lowly voice ilioneus began

      o queen indulgd by favour of the gods
      to found an empire in these new abodes
      to build a town with statutes to restrain
      the wild inhabitants beneath thy reign
      we wretched trojans tossd on evry shore
      from sea to sea thy clemency implore
      forbid the fires our shipping to deface
      receive th unhappy fugitives to grace
      and spare the remnant of a pious race
      we come not with design of wasteful prey
      to drive the country force the swains away
      nor such our strength nor such is our desire
      the vanquishd dare not to such thoughts aspire
      a land there is hesperia namd of old
      the soil is fruitful and the men are bold
      th oenotrians held it once by common fame
      now calld italia from the leaders name
      to that sweet region was our voyage bent
      when winds and evry warring element
      disturbd our course and far from sight of land
      cast our torn vessels on the moving sand
      the sea came on the south with mighty roar
      dispersd and dashd the rest upon the rocky shore
      those few you see escapd the storm and fear
      unless you interpose a shipwreck here
      what men what monsters what inhuman race
      what laws what barbrous customs of the place
      shut up a desert shore to drowning men
      and drive us to the cruel seas again
      if our hard fortune no compassion draws
      nor hospitable rights nor human laws
      the gods are just and will revenge our cause
      aeneas was our prince a juster lord
      or nobler warrior never drew a sword
      observant of the right religious of his word
      if yet he lives and draws this vital air
      nor we his friends of safety shall despair
      nor you great queen these offices repent
      which he will equal and perhaps augment
      we want not cities nor sicilian coasts
      where king acestes trojan lineage boasts
      permit our ships a shelter on your shores
      refitted from your woods with planks and oars
      that if our prince be safe we may renew
      our destind course and italy pursue
      but if o best of men the fates ordain
      that thou art swallowd in the libyan main
      and if our young iulus be no more
      dismiss our navy from your friendly shore
      that we to good acestes may return
      and with our friends our common losses mourn
      thus spoke ilioneus the trojan crew
      with cries and clamours his request renew

      the modest queen a while with downcast eyes
      ponderd the speech then briefly thus replies
      trojans dismiss your fears my cruel fate
      and doubts attending an unsettled state
      force me to guard my coast from foreign foes
      who has not heard the story of your woes
      the name and fortune of your native place
      the fame and valour of the phrygian race
      we tyrians are not so devoid of sense
      nor so remote from phoebus influence
      whether to latian shores your course is bent
      or drivn by tempests from your first intent
      you seek the good acestes government
      your men shall be receivd your fleet repaird
      and sail with ships of convoy for your guard
      or would you stay and join your friendly powrs
      to raise and to defend the tyrian towrs
      my wealth my city and myself are yours
      and would to heavn the storm you felt would bring
      on carthaginian coasts your wandring king
      my people shall by my command explore
      the ports and creeks of evry winding shore
      and towns and wilds and shady woods in quest
      of so renownd and so desird a guest

      raisd in his mind the trojan hero stood
      and longd to break from out his ambient cloud
      achates found it and thus urgd his way
      from whence o goddessborn this long delay
      what more can you desire your welcome sure
      your fleet in safety and your friends secure
      one only wants and him we saw in vain
      oppose the storm and swallowd in the main
      orontes in his fate our forfeit paid
      the rest agrees with what your mother said
      scarce had he spoken when the cloud gave way
      the mists flew upward and dissolvd in day

      the trojan chief appeard in open sight
      august in visage and serenely bright
      his mother goddess with her hands divine
      had formd his curling locks and made his temples shine
      and givn his rolling eyes a sparkling grace
      and breathd a youthful vigour on his face
      like polishd ivory beauteous to behold
      or parian marble when enchasd in gold
      thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke
      and thus with manly modesty he spoke

      he whom you seek am i by tempests tossd
      and savd from shipwreck on your libyan coast
      presenting gracious queen before your throne
      a prince that owes his life to you alone
      fair majesty the refuge and redress
      of those whom fate pursues and wants oppress
      you who your pious offices employ
      to save the relics of abandond troy
      receive the shipwreckd on your friendly shore
      with hospitable rites relieve the poor
      associate in your town a wandring train
      and strangers in your palace entertain
      what thanks can wretched fugitives return
      who scatterd thro the world in exile mourn
      the gods if gods to goodness are inclind
      if acts of mercy touch their heavnly mind
      and more than all the gods your genrous heart
      conscious of worth requite its own desert
      in you this age is happy and this earth
      and parents more than mortal gave you birth
      while rolling rivers into seas shall run
      and round the space of heavn the radiant sun
      while trees the mountain tops with shades supply
      your honour name and praise shall never die
      whateer abode my fortune has assignd
      your image shall be present in my mind
      thus having said he turnd with pious haste
      and joyful his expecting friends embracd
      with his right hand ilioneus was gracd
      serestus with his left then to his breast
      cloanthus and the noble gyas pressd
      and so by turns descended to the rest

      the tyrian queen stood fixd upon his face
      pleasd with his motions ravishd with his grace
      admird his fortunes more admird the man
      then recollected stood and thus began
      what fate o goddessborn what angry powrs
      have cast you shipwreckd on our barren shores
      are you the great aeneas known to fame
      who from celestial seed your lineage claim

      the same aeneas whom fair venus bore
      to famd anchises on th idaean shore
      it calls into my mind tho then a child
      when teucer came from salamis exild
      and sought my fathers aid to be restord
      my father belus then with fire and sword
      invaded cyprus made the region bare
      and conquring finishd the successful war
      from him the trojan siege i understood
      the grecian chiefs and your illustrious blood
      your foe himself the dardan valour praisd
      and his own ancestry from trojans raisd
      enter my noble guest and you shall find
      if not a costly welcome yet a kind
      for i myself like you have been distressd
      till heavn afforded me this place of rest
      like you an alien in a land unknown
      i learn to pity woes so like my own
      she said and to the palace led her guest
      then offerd incense and proclaimd a feast
      nor yet less careful for her absent friends
      twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends
      besides a hundred boars a hundred lambs
      with bleating cries attend their milky dams
      and jars of genrous wine and spacious bowls
      she gives to cheer the sailors drooping souls
      now purple hangings clothe the palace walls
      and sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls
      on tyrian carpets richly wrought they dine
      with loads of massy plate the sideboards shine
      and antique vases all of gold embossd
      
      of curious work where on the sides were seen
      the fights and figures of illustrious men
      from their first founder to the present queen

      the good aeneas whose paternal care
      iulus absence could no longer bear
      dispatchd achates to the ships in haste
      to give a glad relation of the past
      and fraught with precious gifts to bring the boy
      snatchd from the ruins of unhappy troy
      a robe of tissue stiff with golden wire
      an upper vest once helens rich attire
      from argos by the famd adultress brought
      with golden flowrs and winding foliage wrought
      her mother ledas present when she came
      to ruin troy and set the world on flame
      the scepter priams eldest daughter bore
      her orient necklace and the crown she wore
      of double texture glorious to behold
      one order set with gems and one with gold
      instructed thus the wise achates goes
      and in his diligence his duty shows

      but venus anxious for her sons affairs
      new counsels tries and new designs prepares
      that cupid should assume the shape and face
      of sweet ascanius and the sprightly grace
      should bring the presents in her nephews stead
      and in elizas veins the gentle poison shed
      for much she feard the tyrians doubletongued
      and knew the town to junos care belongd
      these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke
      and thus alarmd to winged love she spoke
      my son my strength whose mighty powr alone
      controls the thundrer on his awful throne
      to thee thy muchafflicted mother flies
      and on thy succour and thy faith relies
      thou knowst my son how joves revengeful wife
      by force and fraud attempts thy brothers life
      and often hast thou mournd with me his pains
      him dido now with blandishment detains
      but i suspect the town where juno reigns
      for this tis needful to prevent her art
      and fire with love the proud phoenicians heart
      a love so violent so strong so sure
      as neither age can change nor art can cure
      how this may be performd now take my mind
      ascanius by his father is designd
      to come with presents laden from the port
      to gratify the queen and gain the court
      i mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep
      and ravishd in idalian bowrs to keep
      or high cythera that the sweet deceit
      may pass unseen and none prevent the cheat
      take thou his form and shape i beg the grace
      but only for a nights revolving space
      thyself a boy assume a boys dissembled face
      that when amidst the fervour of the feast
      the tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast
      and with sweet kisses in her arms constrains
      thou mayst infuse thy venom in her veins
      the god of love obeys and sets aside
      his bow and quiver and his plumy pride
      he walks iulus in his mothers sight
      and in the sweet resemblance takes delight

      the goddess then to young ascanius flies
      and in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes
      lulld in her lap amidst a train of loves
      she gently bears him to her blissful groves
      then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head
      and softly lays him on a flowry bed
      cupid meantime assumd his form and face
      follwing achates with a shorter pace
      and brought the gifts the queen already sate
      amidst the trojan lords in shining state
      high on a golden bed her princely guest
      was next her side in order sate the rest
      then canisters with bread are heapd on high
      th attendants water for their hands supply
      and having washd with silken towels dry
      next fifty handmaids in long order bore
      the censers and with fumes the gods adore
      then youths and virgins twice as many join
      to place the dishes and to serve the wine
      the tyrian train admitted to the feast
      approach and on the painted couches rest
      all on the trojan gifts with wonder gaze
      but view the beauteous boy with more amaze
      his rosycolourd cheeks his radiant eyes
      his motions voice and shape and all the gods disguise
      nor pass unpraisd the vest and veil divine
      which wandring foliage and rich flowrs entwine
      but far above the rest the royal dame
      
      with eyes insatiate and tumultuous joy
      beholds the presents and admires the boy
      the guileful god about the hero long
      with childrens play and false embraces hung
      then sought the queen she took him to her arms
      with greedy pleasure and devourd his charms
      unhappy dido little thought what guest
      how dire a god she drew so near her breast
      but he not mindless of his mothers prayr
      works in the pliant bosom of the fair
      and moulds her heart anew and blots her former care
      the dead is to the living love resignd
      and all aeneas enters in her mind

      now when the rage of hunger was appeasd
      the meat removd and evry guest was pleasd
      the golden bowls with sparkling wine are crownd
      and thro the palace cheerful cries resound
      from gilded roofs depending lamps display
      nocturnal beams that emulate the day
      a golden bowl that shone with gems divine
      the queen commanded to be crownd with wine
      the bowl that belus usd and all the tyrian line
      then silence thro the hall proclaimd she spoke
      o hospitable jove we thus invoke
      with solemn rites thy sacred name and powr
      bless to both nations this auspicious hour
      so may the trojan and the tyrian line
      in lasting concord from this day combine
      thou bacchus god of joys and friendly cheer
      and gracious juno both be present here
      and you my lords of tyre your vows address
      to heavn with mine to ratify the peace
      the goblet then she took with nectar crownd
      
      and raisd it to her mouth with sober grace
      then sipping offerd to the next in place
      twas bitias whom she calld a thirsty soul
      he took the challenge and embracd the bowl
      with pleasure swilld the gold nor ceasd to draw
      till he the bottom of the brimmer saw
      the goblet goes around iopas brought
      his golden lyre and sung what ancient atlas taught
      the various labours of the wandring moon
      and whence proceed th eclipses of the sun
      th original of men and beasts and whence
      the rains arise and fires their warmth dispense
      and fixd and erring stars dispose their influence
      what shakes the solid earth what cause delays
      the summer nights and shortens winter days
      with peals of shouts the tyrians praise the song
      those peals are echod by the trojan throng
      th unhappy queen with talk prolongd the night
      and drank large draughts of love with vast delight
      of priam much enquird of hector more
      then askd what arms the swarthy memnon wore
      what troops he landed on the trojan shore
      the steeds of diomede varied the discourse
      and fierce achilles with his matchless force
      at length as fate and her ill stars requird
      to hear the series of the war desird
      relate at large my godlike guest she said
      the grecian stratagems the town betrayd
      the fatal issue of so long a war
      your flight your wandrings and your woes declare
      for since on evry sea on evry coast
      your men have been distressd your navy tossd
      sevn times the sun has either tropic viewd
      the winter banishd and the spring renewd



 

      all were attentive to the godlike man
      when from his lofty couch he thus began
      great queen what you command me to relate
      renews the sad remembrance of our fate
      an empire from its old foundations rent
      and evry woe the trojans underwent
      a peopled city made a desert place
      all that i saw and part of which i was
      not evn the hardest of our foes could hear
      nor stern ulysses tell without a tear
      and now the latter watch of wasting night
      and setting stars to kindly rest invite
      but since you take such intrest in our woe
      and troys disastrous end desire to know
      i will restrain my tears and briefly tell
      what in our last and fatal night befell

      by destiny compelld and in despair
      the greeks grew weary of the tedious war
      and by minervas aid a fabric reard
      which like a steed of monstrous height appeard
      the sides were plankd with pine they feignd it made
      for their return and this the vow they paid
      thus they pretend but in the hollow side
      selected numbers of their soldiers hide
      with inward arms the dire machine they load
      and iron bowels stuff the dark abode
      in sight of troy lies tenedos an isle
      
      renownd for wealth but since a faithless bay
      where ships exposd to wind and weather lay
      there was their fleet conceald we thought for greece
      their sails were hoisted and our fears release
      the trojans coopd within their walls so long
      unbar their gates and issue in a throng
      like swarming bees and with delight survey
      the camp deserted where the grecians lay
      the quarters of the sevral chiefs they showd
      here phoenix here achilles made abode
      here joind the battles there the navy rode
      part on the pile their wondring eyes employ
      the pile by pallas raisd to ruin troy
      thymoetes first 
      movd that the ramparts might be broken down
      to lodge the monster fabric in the town
      but capys and the rest of sounder mind
      the fatal present to the flames designed
      or to the watry deep at least to bore
      the hollow sides and hidden frauds explore
      the giddy vulgar as their fancies guide
      with noise say nothing and in parts divide
      laocoon followd by a numrous crowd
      ran from the fort and cried from far aloud
      o wretched countrymen what fury reigns
      what more than madness has possessd your brains
      think you the grecians from your coasts are gone
      and are ulysses arts no better known
      this hollow fabric either must inclose
      within its blind recess our secret foes
      or tis an engine raisd above the town
      t oerlook the walls and then to batter down
      somewhat is sure designd by fraud or force
      trust not their presents nor admit the horse
      thus having said against the steed he threw
      his forceful spear which hissing as it flew
      piercd thro the yielding planks of jointed wood
      and trembling in the hollow belly stood
      the sides transpiercd return a rattling sound
      and groans of greeks inclosd come issuing thro the wound
      and had not heavn the fall of troy designd
      or had not men been fated to be blind
      enough was said and done tinspire a better mind
      then had our lances piercd the treachrous wood
      and ilian towrs and priams empire stood
      meantime with shouts the trojan shepherds bring
      a captive greek in bands before the king
      taken to take who made himself their prey
      t impose on their belief and troy betray
      fixd on his aim and obstinately bent
      to die undaunted or to circumvent
      about the captive tides of trojans flow
      all press to see and some insult the foe
      now hear how well the greeks their wiles disguisd
      behold a nation in a man comprisd
      trembling the miscreant stood unarmd and bound
      he stard and rolld his haggard eyes around
      then said alas what earth remains what sea
      is open to receive unhappy me
      what fate a wretched fugitive attends
      scornd by my foes abandond by my friends
      he said and sighd and cast a rueful eye
      our pity kindles and our passions die
      we cheer the youth to make his own defence
      and freely tell us what he was and whence
      what news he could impart we long to know
      and what to credit from a captive foe

      his fear at length dismissd he said whateer
      my fate ordains my words shall be sincere
      i neither can nor dare my birth disclaim
      greece is my country sinon is my name
      tho plungd by fortunes powr in misery
      tis not in fortunes powr to make me lie
      if any chance has hither brought the name
      of palamedes not unknown to fame
      who sufferd from the malice of the times
      accusd and sentencd for pretended crimes
      because these fatal wars he would prevent
      whose death the wretched greeks too late lament
      me then a boy my father poor and bare
      of other means committed to his care
      his kinsman and companion in the war
      while fortune favourd while his arms support
      the cause and ruld the counsels of the court
      i made some figure there nor was my name
      obscure nor i without my share of fame
      but when ulysses with fallacious arts
      had made impression in the peoples hearts
      and forgd a treason in my patrons name
      
      my kinsman fell then i without support
      in private mournd his loss and left the court
      mad as i was i could not bear his fate
      with silent grief but loudly blamd the state
      and cursd the direful author of my woes
      twas told again and hence my ruin rose
      i threatend if indulgent heavn once more
      would land me safely on my native shore
      his death with double vengeance to restore
      this movd the murderers hate and soon ensued
      th effects of malice from a man so proud
      ambiguous rumours thro the camp he spread
      and sought by treason my devoted head
      new crimes invented left unturnd no stone
      to make my guilt appear and hide his own
      till calchas was by force and threatning wrought
      but whywhy dwell i on that anxious thought
      if on my nation just revenge you seek
      and tis t appear a foe t appear a greek
      already you my name and country know
      assuage your thirst of blood and strike the blow
      my death will both the kingly brothers please
      and set insatiate ithacus at ease
      this fair unfinishd tale these broken starts
      raisd expectations in our longing hearts
      unknowing as we were in grecian arts
      his former trembling once again renewd
      with acted fear the villain thus pursued

      long had the grecians 
      resolvd to raise the siege and leave the town
      and had the gods permitted they had gone
      but oft the wintry seas and southern winds
      withstood their passage home and changd their minds
      portents and prodigies their souls amazd
      but most when this stupendous pile was raisd
      then flaming meteors hung in air were seen
      and thunders rattled thro a sky serene
      dismayd and fearful of some dire event
      eurypylus t enquire their fate was sent
      he from the gods this dreadful answer brought

      o grecians when the trojan shores you sought
      your passage with a virgins blood was bought
      so must your safe return be bought again
      and grecian blood once more atone the main
      the spreading rumour round the people ran
      all feard and each believd himself the man
      ulysses took th advantage of their fright
      calld calchas and producd in open sight
      then bade him name the wretch ordaind by fate
      the public victim to redeem the state
      already some presagd the dire event
      and saw what sacrifice ulysses meant
      for twice five days the good old seer withstood
      th intended treason and was dumb to blood
      till tird with endless clamours and pursuit
      of ithacus he stood no longer mute
      but as it was agreed pronouncd that i
      was destind by the wrathful gods to die
      all praisd the sentence pleasd the storm should fall
      on one alone whose fury threatend all
      the dismal day was come the priests prepare
      their leavend cakes and fillets for my hair
      i followd natures laws and must avow
      i broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow
      hid in a weedy lake all night i lay
      secure of safety when they saild away
      but now what further hopes for me remain
      to see my friends or native soil again
      my tender infants or my careful sire
      whom they returning will to death require
      will perpetrate on them their first design
      and take the forfeit of their heads for mine
      which o if pity mortal minds can move
      if there be faith below or gods above
      if innocence and truth can claim desert
      ye trojans from an injurd wretch avert

      false tears true pity move the king commands
      to loose his fetters and unbind his hands
      then adds these friendly words dismiss thy fears
      forget the greeks be mine as thou wert theirs
      but truly tell was it for force or guile
      or some religious end you raisd the pile
      thus said the king he full of fraudful arts
      this wellinvented tale for truth imparts
      ye lamps of heavn he said and lifted high
      his hands now free thou venerable sky
      inviolable powrs adord with dread
      ye fatal fillets that once bound this head
      ye sacred altars from whose flames i fled
      be all of you adjurd and grant i may
      without a crime th ungrateful greeks betray
      reveal the secrets of the guilty state
      and justly punish whom i justly hate
      but you o king preserve the faith you gave
      if i to save myself your empire save
      the grecian hopes and all th attempts they made
      were only founded on minervas aid
      but from the time when impious diomede
      and false ulysses that inventive head
      her fatal image from the temple drew
      the sleeping guardians of the castle slew
      her virgin statue with their bloody hands
      polluted and profand her holy bands
      from thence the tide of fortune left their shore
      and ebbd much faster than it flowd before
      their courage languishd as their hopes decayd
      and pallas now averse refusd her aid
      nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
      her alterd mind and alienated care
      when first her fatal image touchd the ground
      she sternly cast her glaring eyes around
      that sparkled as they rolld and seemd to threat
      her heavnly limbs distilld a briny sweat
      thrice from the ground she leapd was seen to wield
      her brandishd lance and shake her horrid shield
      then calchas bade our host for flight
      and hope no conquest from the tedious war
      till first they saild for greece with prayrs besought
      her injurd powr and better omens brought
      and now their navy plows the watry main
      yet soon expect it on your shores again
      with pallas pleasd as calchas did ordain
      but first to reconcile the blueeyd maid
      for her stoln statue and her towr betrayd
      warnd by the seer to her offended name
      we raisd and dedicate this wondrous frame
      so lofty lest thro your forbidden gates
      it pass and intercept our better fates
      for once admitted there our hopes are lost
      and troy may then a new palladium boast
      for so religion and the gods ordain
      that if you violate with hands profane
      minervas gift your town in flames shall burn
      
      but if it climb with your assisting hands
      the trojan walls and in the city stands
      then troy shall argos and mycenae burn
      and the reverse of fate on us return

      with such deceits he gaind their easy hearts
      too prone to credit his perfidious arts
      what diomede nor thetis greater son
      a thousand ships nor ten years siege had done
      false tears and fawning words the city won

      a greater omen and of worse portent
      did our unwary minds with fear torment
      concurring to produce the dire event
      laocoon neptunes priest by lot that year
      with solemn pomp then sacrificd a steer
      when dreadful to behold from sea we spied
      two serpents rankd abreast the seas divide
      and smoothly sweep along the swelling tide
      their flaming crests above the waves they show
      their bellies seem to burn the seas below
      their speckled tails advance to steer their course
      and on the sounding shore the flying billows force
      and now the strand and now the plain they held
      their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were filld
      their nimble tongues they brandishd as they came
      and lickd their hissing jaws that sputterd flame
      we fled amazd their destind way they take
      and to laocoon and his children make
      and first around the tender boys they wind
      then with their sharpend fangs their limbs and bodies grind
      the wretched father running to their aid
      with pious haste but vain they next invade
      twice round his waist their winding volumes rolld
      and twice about his gasping throat they fold
      the priest thus doubly chokd their crests divide
      and towring oer his head in triumph ride
      with both his hands he labours at the knots
      his holy fillets the blue venom blots
      his roaring fills the flitting air around
      thus when an ox receives a glancing wound
      he breaks his bands the fatal altar flies
      and with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies
      their tasks performd the serpents quit their prey
      and to the towr of pallas make their way
      couchd at her feet they lie protected there
      by her large buckler and protended spear
      amazement seizes all the genral cry
      proclaims laocoon justly doomd to die
      whose hand the will of pallas had withstood
      and dared to violate the sacred wood
      all vote t admit the steed that vows be paid
      and incense offerd to th offended maid
      a spacious breach is made the town lies bare
      some hoisting levers some the wheels prepare
      and fasten to the horses feet the rest
      with cables haul along th unwieldly beast
      each on his fellow for assistance calls
      at length the fatal fabric mounts the walls
      big with destruction boys with chaplets crownd
      and choirs of virgins sing and dance around
      thus raisd aloft and then descending down
      it enters oer our heads and threats the town
      o sacred city built by hands divine
      o valiant heroes of the trojan line
      four times he struck as oft the clashing sound
      of arms was heard and inward groans rebound
      yet mad with zeal and blinded with our fate
      we haul along the horse in solemn state
      then place the dire portent within the towr
      cassandra cried and cursd th unhappy hour
      foretold our fate but by the gods decree
      all heard and none believd the prophecy
      with branches we the fanes adorn and waste
      in jollity the day ordaind to be the last
      meantime the rapid heavns rolld down the light
      and on the shaded ocean rushd the night
      our men secure nor guards nor sentries held
      but easy sleep their weary limbs compelld
      the grecians had embarkd their naval powrs
      from tenedos and sought our wellknown shores
      safe under covert of the silent night
      and guided by th imperial galleys light
      when sinon favourd by the partial gods
      unlockd the horse and opd his dark abodes
      restord to vital air our hidden foes
      who joyful from their long confinement rose
      tysander bold and sthenelus their guide
      and dire ulysses down the cable slide
      then thoas athamas and pyrrhus haste
      nor was the podalirian hero last
      nor injurd menelaus nor the famd
      epeus who the fatal engine framd
      a nameless crowd succeed their forces join
      t invade the town oppressd with sleep and wine
      those few they find awake first meet their fate
      then to their fellows they unbar the gate

      twas in the dead of night when sleep repairs
      our bodies worn with toils our minds with cares
      when hectors ghost before my sight appears
      a bloody shroud he seemd and bathd in tears
      such as he was when by pelides slain
      thessalian coursers draggd him oer the plain
      swoln were his feet as when the thongs were thrust
      thro the bord holes his body black with dust
      unlike that hector who returnd from toils
      of war triumphant in aeacian spoils
      or him who made the fainting greeks retire
      and launchd against their navy phrygian fire
      his hair and beard stood stiffend with his gore
      and all the wounds he for his country bore
      now streamd afresh and with new purple ran
      i wept to see the visionary man
      and while my trance continued thus began
      o light of trojans and support of troy
      thy fathers champion and thy countrys joy
      o long expected by thy friends from whence
      art thou so late returnd for our defence
      do we behold thee wearied as we are
      with length of labours and with toils of war
      after so many funrals of thy own
      art thou restord to thy declining town
      but say what wounds are these what new disgrace
      deforms the manly features of thy face

      to this the spectre no reply did frame
      but answerd to the cause for which he came
      and groaning from the bottom of his breast
      this warning in these mournful words expressd
      o goddessborn escape by timely flight
      the flames and horrors of this fatal night
      the foes already have possessd the wall
      troy nods from high and totters to her fall
      enough is paid to priams royal name
      more than enough to duty and to fame
      if by a mortal hand my fathers throne
      could be defended twas by mine alone
      now troy to thee commends her future state
      and gives her gods companions of thy fate
      from their assistance walls expect
      which wandring long at last thou shalt erect
      he said and brought me from their blest abodes
      the venerable statues of the gods
      with ancient vesta from the sacred choir
      the wreaths and relics of th immortal fire

      now peals of shouts come thundring from afar
      cries threats and loud laments and mingled war
      the noise approaches tho our palace stood
      aloof from streets encompassd with a wood
      louder and yet more loud i hear th alarms
      of human cries distinct and clashing arms
      fear broke my slumbers i no longer stay
      but mount the terrace thence the town survey
      and hearken what the frightful sounds convey
      thus when a flood of fire by wind is borne
      crackling it rolls and mows the standing corn
      or deluges descending on the plains
      sweep oer the yellow ear destroy the pains
      of labring oxen and the peasants gains
      unroot the forest oaks and bear away
      flocks folds and trees and undistinguishd prey
      the shepherd climbs the cliff and sees from far
      the wasteful ravage of the watry war
      then hectors faith was manifestly cleard
      and grecian frauds in open light appeard
      the palace of deiphobus ascends
      in smoky flames and catches on his friends
      ucalegon burns next the seas are bright
      with splendour not their own and shine with trojan light
      new clamours and new clangours now arise
      the sound of trumpets mixd with fighting cries
      with frenzy seizd i run to meet th alarms
      resolvd on death resolvd to die in arms
      but first to gather friends with them t oppose
      if fortune favourd and repel the foes
      spurrd by my courage by my country fird
      with sense of honour and revenge inspird

      pantheus apollos priest a sacred name
      had scapd the grecian swords and passd the flame
      with relics loaden to my doors he fled
      and by the hand his tender grandson led
      what hope o pantheus whither can we run
      where make a stand and what may yet be done
      scarce had i said when pantheus with a groan
      troy is no more and ilium was a town
      the fatal day th appointed hour is come
      when wrathful joves irrevocable doom
      transfers the trojan state to grecian hands
      the fire consumes the town the foe commands
      and armed hosts an unexpected force
      break from the bowels of the fatal horse
      within the gates proud sinon throws about
      the flames and foes for entrance press without
      with thousand others whom i fear to name
      more than from argos or mycenae came
      to sevral posts their parties they divide
      some block the narrow streets some scour the wide
      the bold they kill th unwary they surprise
      who fights finds death and death finds him who flies
      the warders of the gate but scarce maintain
      th unequal combat and resist in vain

      i heard and heavn that wellborn souls inspires
      prompts me thro lifted swords and rising fires
      to run where clashing arms and clamour calls
      and rush undaunted to defend the walls
      ripheus and iphitas by my side engage
      for valour one renownd and one for age
      dymas and hypanis by moonlight knew
      my motions and my mien and to my party drew
      with young coroebus who by love was led
      to win renown and fair cassandras bed
      and lately brought his troops to priams aid
      forewarnd in vain by the prophetic maid
      whom when i saw resolvd in arms to fall
      and that one spirit animated all
      brave souls said i but brave alas in vain
      come finish what our cruel fates ordain
      you see the desprate state of our affairs
      and heavns protecting powrs are deaf to prayrs
      the passive gods behold the greeks defile
      their temples and abandon to the spoil
      their own abodes we feeble few conspire
      to save a sinking town involvd in fire
      then let us fall but fall amidst our foes
      despair of life the means of living shows
      so bold a speech incouragd their desire
      of death and added fuel to their fire

      as hungry wolves with raging appetite
      scour thro the fields nor fear the stormy night
      their whelps at home expect the promisd food
      and long to temper their dry chaps in blood
      so rushd we forth at once resolvd to die
      resolvd in death the last extremes to try
      we leave the narrow lanes behind and dare
      th unequal combat in the public square
      night was our friend our leader was despair
      what tongue can tell the slaughter of that night
      what eyes can weep the sorrows and affright
      an ancient and imperial city falls
      the streets are filld with frequent funerals
      houses and holy temples float in blood
      and hostile nations make a common flood
      not only trojans fall but in their turn
      the vanquishd triumph and the victors mourn
      ours take new courage from despair and night
      confusd the fortune is confusd the fight
      all parts resound with tumults plaints and fears
      and grisly death in sundry shapes appears
      androgeos fell among us with his band
      who thought us grecians newly come to land
      from whence said he my friends this long delay
      you loiter while the spoils are borne away
      our ships are laden with the trojan store
      and you like truants come too late ashore
      he said but soon corrected his mistake
      found by the doubtful answers which we make
      amazd he would have shunnd th unequal fight
      but we more numrous intercept his flight
      as when some peasant in a bushy brake
      has with unwary footing pressd a snake
      he starts aside astonishd when he spies
      his rising crest blue neck and rolling eyes
      so from our arms surprisd androgeos flies
      in vain for him and his we compassd round
      possessd with fear unknowing of the ground
      and of their lives an easy conquest found
      thus fortune on our first endeavor smild
      coroebus then with youthful hopes beguild
      swoln with success and a daring mind
      this new invention fatally designd
      my friends said he since fortune shows the way
      tis fit we should th auspicious guide obey
      for what has she these grecian arms bestowd
      but their destruction and the trojans good
      then change we shields and their devices bear
      let fraud supply the want of force in war
      they find us arms this said himself he dressd
      in dead androgeos spoils his upper vest
      his painted buckler and his plumy crest
      thus ripheus dymas all the trojan train
      lay down their own attire and strip the slain
      mixd with the greeks we go with ill presage
      flatterd with hopes to glut our greedy rage
      unknown assaulting whom we blindly meet
      and strew with grecian carcasses the street
      thus while their straggling parties we defeat
      some to the shore and safer ships retreat
      and some oppressd with more ignoble fear
      remount the hollow horse and pant in secret there

      but ah what use of valour can be made
      when heavns propitious powrs refuse their aid
      behold the royal prophetess the fair
      cassandra draggd by her disheveld hair
      whom not minervas shrine nor sacred bands
      in safety could protect from sacrilegious hands
      on heavn she cast her eyes she sighd she cried
       her tender arms were tied
      so sad a sight coroebus could not bear
      but fird with rage distracted with despair
      amid the barbrous ravishers he flew
      our leaders rash example we pursue
      but storms of stones from the proud temples height
      pour down and on our batterd helms alight
      we from our friends receivd this fatal blow
      who thought us grecians as we seemd in show
      they aim at the mistaken crests from high
      and ours beneath the pondrous ruin lie
      then movd with anger and disdain to see
      their troops dispersd the royal virgin free
      the grecians rally and their powrs unite
      with fury charge us and renew the fight
      the brother kings with ajax join their force
      and the whole squadron of thessalian horse

      thus when the rival winds their quarrel try
      contending for the kingdom of the sky
      south east and west on airy coursers borne
      the whirlwind gathers and the woods are torn
      then nereus strikes the deep the billows rise
      and mixd with ooze and sand pollute the skies
      the troops we squanderd first again appear
      from several quarters and enclose the rear
      they first observe and to the rest betray
      our diffrent speech our borrowd arms survey
      oppressd with odds we fall coroebus first
      at pallas altar by peneleus piercd
      then ripheus followd in th unequal fight
      just of his word observant of the right
      heavn thought not so dymas their fate attends
      with hypanis mistaken by their friends
      nor pantheus thee thy mitre nor the bands
      of awful phoebus savd from impious hands
      ye trojan flames your testimony bear
      what i performd and what i sufferd there
      no sword avoiding in the fatal strife
      exposd to death and prodigal of life
      witness ye heavens i live not by my fault
      i strove to have deservd the death i sought
      but when i could not fight and would have died
      borne off to distance by the growing tide
      old iphitus and i were hurried thence
      with pelias wounded and without defence
      new clamours from th invested palace ring
      we run to die or disengage the king
      so hot th assault so high the tumult rose
      while ours defend and while the greeks oppose
      as all the dardan and argolic race
      had been contracted in that narrow space
      or as all ilium else were void of fear
      and tumult war and slaughter only there
      their targets in a tortoise cast the foes
      secure advancing to the turrets rose
      some mount the scaling ladders some more bold
      swerve upwards and by posts and pillars hold
      their left hand gripes their bucklers in th ascent
      while with their right they seize the battlement
      from their demolishd towrs the trojans throw
      huge heaps of stones that falling crush the foe
      and heavy beams and rafters from the sides
      
      and gilded roofs come tumbling from on high
      the marks of state and ancient royalty
      the guards below fixd in the pass attend
      the charge undaunted and the gate defend
      renewd in courage with recoverd breath
      a second time we ran to tempt our death
      to clear the palace from the foe succeed
      the weary living and revenge the dead

      a postern door yet unobservd and free
      joind by the length of a blind gallery
      to the kings closet led a way well known
      to hectors wife while priam held the throne
      thro which she brought astyanax unseen
      to cheer his grandsire and his grandsires queen
      thro this we pass and mount the towr from whence
      with unavailing arms the trojans make defence
      from this the trembling king had oft descried
      the grecian camp and saw their navy ride
      beams from its lofty height with swords we hew
      then wrenching with our hands th assault renew
      and where the rafters on the columns meet
      we push them headlong with our arms and feet
      the lightning flies not swifter than the fall
      nor thunder louder than the ruind wall
      down goes the top at once the greeks beneath
      are piecemeal torn or pounded into death
      yet more succeed and more to death are sent
      we cease not from above nor they below relent
      before the gate stood pyrrhus threatning loud
      with glittring arms conspicuous in the crowd
      so shines renewd in youth the crested snake
      who slept the winter in a thorny brake
      and casting off his slough when spring returns
      now looks aloft and with new glory burns
      restord with poisonous herbs his ardent sides
      reflect the sun and raisd on spires he rides
      high oer the grass hissing he rolls along
      and brandishes by fits his forky tongue
      proud periphas and fierce automedon
      his fathers charioteer together run
      to force the gate the scyrian infantry
      rush on in crowds and the barrd passage free
      entring the court with shouts the skies they rend
      and flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend
      himself among the foremost deals his blows
      and with his ax repeated strokes bestows
      on the strong doors then all their shoulders ply
      till from the posts the brazen hinges fly
      he hews apace the double bars at length
      yield to his ax and unresisted strength
      a mighty breach is made the rooms conceald
      appear and all the palace is reveald
      the halls of audience and of public state
      and where the lonely queen in secret sate
      armd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen
      with not a door and scarce a space between
      the house is filld with loud laments and cries
      and shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies
      the fearful matrons run from place to place
      and kiss the thresholds and the posts embrace
      the fatal work inhuman pyrrhus plies
      and all his father sparkles in his eyes
      nor bars nor fighting guards his force sustain
      the bars are broken and the guards are slain
      in rush the greeks and all the apartments fill
      those few defendants whom they find they kill
      not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood
      roars when he finds his rapid course withstood
      bears down the dams with unresisted sway
      and sweeps the cattle and the cots away
      these eyes beheld him when he marchd between
      the brother kings i saw th unhappy queen
      the hundred wives and where old priam stood
      to stain his hallowd altar with his brood
      the fifty nuptial beds 
      the posts of plated gold and hung with spoils
      fell the reward of the proud victors toils
      whereer the raging fire had left a space
      the grecians enter and possess the place

      perhaps you may of priams fate enquire
      he when he saw his regal town on fire
      his ruind palace and his entring foes
      on evry side inevitable woes
      in arms disusd invests his limbs decayd
      like them with age a late and useless aid
      his feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain
      loaded not armd he creeps along with pain
      despairing of success ambitious to be slain
      uncoverd but by heavn there stood in view
      an altar near the hearth a laurel grew
      dodderd with age whose boughs encompass round
      the household gods and shade the holy ground
      here hecuba with all her helpless train
      of dames for shelter sought but sought in vain
      drivn like a flock of doves along the sky
      their images they hug and to their altars fly
      the queen when she beheld her trembling lord
      and hanging by his side a heavy sword
      what rage she cried has seizd my husbands mind
      what arms are these and to what use designd
      these times want other aids were hector here
      evn hector now in vain like priam would appear
      with us one common shelter thou shalt find
      or in one common fate with us be joind
      she said and with a last salute embracd
      the poor old man and by the laurel placd
      behold polites one of priams sons
      pursued by pyrrhus there for safety runs
      thro swords and foes amazd and hurt he flies
      thro empty courts and open galleries
      him pyrrhus urging with his lance pursues
      and often reaches and his thrusts renews
      the youth transfixd with lamentable cries
      expires before his wretched parents eyes
      whom gasping at his feet when priam saw
      the fear of death gave place to natures law
      and shaking more with anger than with age
      the gods said he requite thy brutal rage
      as sure they will barbarian sure they must
      if there be gods in heavn and gods be just
      who takst in wrongs an insolent delight
      with a sons death t infect a fathers sight
      not he whom thou and lying fame conspire
      to call thee his not he thy vaunted sire
      thus usd my wretched age the gods he feard
      the laws of nature and of nations heard
      he cheerd my sorrows and for sums of gold
      the bloodless carcass of my hector sold
      pitied the woes a parent underwent
      and sent me back in safety from his tent

      this said his feeble hand a javelin threw
      which fluttring seemd to loiter as it flew
      just and but barely to the mark it held
      and faintly tinkled on the brazen shield

      then pyrrhus thus go thou from me to fate
      and to my father my foul deeds relate
      now die with that he draggd the trembling sire
      sliddring thro clotterd blood and holy mire
      
      hauld from beneath the violated shade
      and on the sacred pile the royal victim laid
      his right hand held his bloody falchion bare
      his left he twisted in his hoary hair
      then with a speeding thrust his heart he found
      the lukewarm blood came rushing thro the wound
      and sanguine streams distaind the sacred ground
      thus priam fell and shard one common fate
      with troy in ashes and his ruind state
      he who the scepter of all asia swayd
      whom monarchs like domestic slaves obeyd
      on the bleak shore now lies th abandond king
      a headless carcass and a nameless thing

      then not before i felt my curdled blood
      congeal with fear my hair with horror stood
      my fathers image filld my pious mind
      lest equal years might equal fortune find
      again i thought on my forsaken wife
      and trembled for my sons abandond life
      i lookd about but found myself alone
      deserted at my need my friends were gone
      some spent with toil some with despair oppressd
      leapd headlong from the heights the flames consumd the rest
      thus wandring in my way without a guide
      the graceless helen in the porch i spied
      of vestas temple there she lurkd alone
      muffled she sate and what she could unknown
      but by the flames that cast their blaze around
      that common bane of greece and troy i found
      for ilium burnt she dreads the trojan sword
      more dreads the vengeance of her injurd lord
      evn by those gods who refugd her abhorrd
      trembling with rage the strumpet i regard
      resolvd to give her guilt the due reward
      shall she triumphant sail before the wind
      and leave in flames unhappy troy behind
      shall she her kingdom and her friends review
      in state attended with a captive crew
      while unrevengd the good old priam falls
      and grecian fires consume the trojan walls
      for this the phrygian fields and xanthian flood
      were swelld with bodies and were drunk with blood
      tis true a soldier can small honour gain
      and boast no conquest from a woman slain
      yet shall the fact not pass without applause
      of vengeance taken in so just a cause
      the punishd crime shall set my soul at ease
      and murmring manes of my friends appease
      thus while i rave a gleam of pleasing light
      spread oer the place and shining heavnly bright
      my mother stood reveald before my sight
      never so radiant did her eyes appear
      not her own star confessd a light so clear
      great in her charms as when on gods above
      she looks and breathes herself into their love
      she held my hand the destind blow to break
      then from her rosy lips began to speak
      my son from whence this madness this neglect
      of my commands and those whom i protect
      why this unmanly rage recall to mind
      whom you forsake what pledges leave behind
      look if your helpless father yet survive
      or if ascanius or creusa live
      around your house the greedy grecians err
      and these had perishd in the nightly war
      but for my presence and protecting care
      not helens face nor paris was in fault
      but by the gods was this destruction brought
      now cast your eyes around while i dissolve
      the mists and films that mortal eyes involve
      purge from your sight the dross and make you see
      the shape of each avenging deity
      enlightend thus my just commands fulfil
      nor fear obedience to your mothers will
      where yon disorderd heap of ruin lies
      stones rent from stones where clouds of dust arise
      amid that smother neptune holds his place
      below the walls foundation drives his mace
      and heaves the building from the solid base
      look where in arms imperial juno stands
      full in the scaean gate with loud commands
      urging on shore the tardy grecian bands
      see pallas of her snaky buckler proud
      bestrides the towr refulgent thro the cloud
      see jove new courage to the foe supplies
      and arms against the town the partial deities
      haste hence my son this fruitless labour end
      haste where your trembling spouse and sire attend
      haste and a mothers care your passage shall befriend
      she said and swiftly vanishd from my sight
      obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night
      i lookd i listend dreadful sounds i hear
      and the dire forms of hostile gods appear
      troy sunk in flames i saw nor could prevent
      and ilium from its old foundations rent
      rent like a mountain ash which dard the winds
      and stood the sturdy strokes of labring hinds
      about the roots the cruel ax resounds
      the stumps are piercd with oftrepeated wounds
      the war is felt on high the nodding crown
      now threats a fall and throws the leafy honours down
      to their united force it yields tho late
      and mourns with mortal groans th approaching fate
      the roots no more their upper load sustain
      but down she falls and spreads a ruin thro the plain

      descending thence i scape thro foes and fire
      before the goddess foes and flames retire
      arrivd at home he for whose only sake
      or most for his such toils i undertake
      the good anchises whom by timely flight
      i purposd to secure on idas height
      refusd the journey resolute to die
      and add his funrals to the fate of troy
      rather than exile and old age sustain
      go you whose blood runs warm in evry vein
      had heavn decreed that i should life enjoy
      heavn had decreed to save unhappy troy
      tis sure enough if not too much for one
      twice to have seen our ilium overthrown
      make haste to save the poor remaining crew
      and give this useless corpse a long adieu
      these weak old hands suffice to stop my breath
      at least the pitying foes will aid my death
      to take my spoils and leave my body bare
      as for my sepulcher let heavn take care
      tis long since i for my celestial wife
      loathd by the gods have draggd a lingring life
      since evry hour and moment i expire
      blasted from heavn by joves avenging fire
      this oft repeated he stood fixd to die
      myself my wife my son my family
      intreat pray beg and raise a doleful cry
      what will he still persist on death resolve
      and in his ruin all his house involve
      he still persists his reasons to maintain
      our prayrs our tears our loud laments are vain

      urgd by despair again i go to try
      the fate of arms resolvd in fight to die
      what hope remains but what my death must give
      can i without so dear a father live
      you term it prudence what i baseness call
      could such a word from such a parent fall
      if fortune please and so the gods ordain
      that nothing should of ruind troy remain
      and you conspire with fortune to be slain
      the way to death is wide th approaches near
      for soon relentless pyrrhus will appear
      reeking with priams blood the wretch who slew
      the son  in the fathers view
      and then the sire himself to the dire altar drew
      o goddess mother give me back to fate
      your gift was undesird and came too late
      did you for this unhappy me convey
      thro foes and fires to see my house a prey
      shall i my father wife and son behold
      weltring in blood each others arms infold
      haste gird my sword tho spent and overcome
      tis the last summons to receive our doom
      i hear thee fate and i obey thy call
      not unrevengd the foe shall see my fall
      restore me to the yet unfinishd fight
      my death is wanting to conclude the night
      armd once again my glittring sword i wield
      while th other hand sustains my weighty shield
      and forth i rush to seek th abandond field
      i went but sad creusa stoppd my way
      and cross the threshold in my passage lay
      embracd my knees and when i would have gone
      shewd me my feeble sire and tender son
      if death be your design at least said she
      take us along to share your destiny
      if any farther hopes in arms remain
      this place these pledges of your love maintain
      to whom do you expose your fathers life
      your sons and mine your now forgotten wife
      while thus she fills the house with clamrous cries
      our hearing is diverted by our eyes
      for while i held my son in the short space
      betwixt our kisses and our last embrace
      strange to relate from young iulus head
      a lambent flame arose which gently spread
      around his brows and on his temples fed
      amazd with running water we prepare
      to quench the sacred fire and slake his hair
      but old anchises versd in omens reard
      his hands to heavn and this request preferrd
      if any vows almighty jove can bend
      thy will if piety can prayrs commend
      confirm the glad presage which thou art pleasd to send
      scarce had he said when on our left we hear
      a peal of rattling thunder roll in air
      there shot a streaming lamp along the sky
      which on the winged lightning seemd to fly
      from oer the roof the blaze began to move
      and trailing vanishd in th idaean grove
      it swept a path in heavn and shone a guide
      then in a steaming stench of sulphur died

      the good old man with suppliant hands implord
      the gods protection and their star adord
      now now said he my son no more delay
      i yield i follow where heavn shews the way
      keep o my country gods our dwelling place
      and guard this relic of the trojan race
      this tender child these omens are your own
      and you can yet restore the ruind town
      at least accomplish what your signs foreshow
      i stand resignd and am prepard to go

      he said the crackling flames appear on high
      and driving sparkles dance along the sky
      with vulcans rage the rising winds conspire
      and near our palace roll the flood of fire
      haste my dear father 
      and load my shoulders with a willing freight
      whateer befalls your life shall be my care
      one death or one delivrance we will share
      my hand shall lead our little son and you
      my faithful consort shall our steps pursue
      next you my servants heed my strict commands
      without the walls a ruind temple stands
      to ceres hallowd once a cypress nigh
      shoots up her venerable head on high
      by long religion kept there bend your feet
      and in divided parties let us meet
      our country gods the relics and the bands
      hold you my father in your guiltless hands
      in me tis impious holy things to bear
      red as i am with slaughter new from war
      till in some living stream i cleanse the guilt
      of dire debate and blood in battle spilt
      thus ordring all that prudence could provide
      i clothe my shoulders with a lions hide
      and yellow spoils then on my bending back
      the welcome load of my dear father take
      while on my better hand ascanius hung
      and with unequal paces trippd along
      creusa kept behind by choice we stray
      thro evry dark and evry devious way
      i who so bold and dauntless just before
      the grecian darts and shock of lances bore
      at evry shadow now am seizd with fear
      not for myself but for the charge i bear
      till near the ruind gate arrivd at last
      secure and deeming all the danger past
      a frightful noise of trampling feet we hear
      my father looking thro the shades with fear
      cried out haste haste my son the foes are nigh
      their swords and shining armour i descry
      some hostile god for some unknown offence
      had sure bereft my mind of better sense
      for while thro winding ways i took my flight
      and sought the shelter of the gloomy night
      alas i lost creusa hard to tell
      if by her fatal destiny she fell
      or weary sate or wanderd with affright
      but she was lost for ever to my sight
      i knew not or reflected till i meet
      my friends at ceres now deserted seat
      we met not one was wanting only she
      deceivd her friends her son and wretched me

      what mad expressions did my tongue refuse
      whom did i not of gods or men accuse
      this was the fatal blow that paind me more
      than all i felt from ruind troy before
      stung with my loss and raving with despair
      abandoning my now forgotten care
      of counsel comfort and of hope bereft
      my sire my son my country gods i left
      in shining armour once again i sheathe
      my limbs not feeling wounds nor fearing death
      then headlong to the burning walls i run
      and seek the danger i was forcd to shun
      i tread my former tracks thro night explore
      each passage evry street i crossd before
      all things were full of horror and affright
      and dreadful evn the silence of the night
      then to my fathers house i make repair
      with some small glimpse of hope to find her there
      instead of her the cruel greeks i met
      the house was filld with foes with flames beset
      drivn on the wings of winds whole sheets of fire
      thro air transported to the roofs aspire
      from thence to priams palace i resort
      and search the citadel and desert court
      then unobservd i pass by junos church
      a guard of grecians had possessd the porch
      there phoenix and ulysses watch the prey
      and thither all the wealth of troy convey
      the spoils which they from ransackd houses brought
      and golden bowls from burning altars caught
      the tables of the gods the purple vests
      the peoples treasure and the pomp of priests
      a rank of wretched youths with piniond hands
      and captive matrons in long order stands
      then with ungovernd madness i proclaim
      thro all the silent street creusas name
      creusa still i call at length she hears
      and sudden thro the shades of night appears
      appears no more creusa nor my wife
      but a pale spectre larger than the life
      aghast astonishd and struck dumb with fear
      i stood like bristles rose my stiffend hair
      then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
      nor tears nor cries can give the dead relief
      desist my muchlovd lord t indulge your pain
      you bear no more than what the gods ordain
      my fates permit me not from hence to fly
      nor he the great controller of the sky
      long wandring ways for you the powrs decree
      on land hard labours and a length of sea
      then after many painful years are past
      on latiums happy shore you shall be cast
      where gentle tiber from his bed beholds
      the flowry meadows and the feeding folds
      there end your toils and there your fates provide
      a quiet kingdom and a royal bride
      there fortune shall the trojan line restore
      and you for lost creusa weep no more
      fear not that i shall watch with servile shame
      th imperious looks of some proud grecian dame
      or stooping to the victors lust disgrace
      my goddess mother or my royal race
      and now farewell the parent of the gods
      restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes
      i trust our common issue to your care
      she said and gliding passd unseen in air
      i strove to speak but horror tied my tongue
      and thrice about her neck my arms i flung
      and thrice deceivd on vain embraces hung
      light as an empty dream at break of day
      or as a blast of wind she rushd away

      thus having passd the night in fruitless pain
      i to my longing friends return again
      amazd th augmented number to behold
      of men and matrons mixd of young and old
      a wretched exild crew together brought
      with arms appointed and with treasure fraught
      resolvd and willing under my command
      to run all hazards both of sea and land
      the morn began from ida to display
      her rosy cheeks and phosphor led the day
      before the gates the grecians took their post
      and all pretence of late relief was lost
      i yield to fate unwillingly retire
      and loaded up the hill convey my sire



 


      when heavn had overturnd the trojan state
      and priams throne by too severe a fate
      when ruind troy became the grecians prey
      and iliums lofty towrs in ashes lay
      warnd by celestial omens we retreat
      to seek in foreign lands a happier seat
      near old antandros and at idas foot
      the timber of the sacred groves we cut
      and build our fleet uncertain yet to find
      what place the gods for our repose assignd
      friends daily flock and scarce the kindly spring
      began to clothe the ground and birds to sing
      when old anchises summond all to sea
      the crew my father and the fates obey
      with sighs and tears i leave my native shore
      and empty fields where ilium stood before
      my sire my son our less and greater gods
      all sail at once and cleave the briny floods

      against our coast appears a spacious land
      which once the fierce lycurgus did command
      thracia the name the people bold in war
      vast are their fields and tillage is their care
      a hospitable realm while fate was kind
      with troy in friendship and religion joind
      i land with luckless omens then adore
      their gods and draw a line along the shore
      i lay the deep foundations of a wall
      and aenos namd from me the city call
      to dionaean venus vows are paid
      and all the powrs that rising labours aid
      a bull on joves imperial altar laid
      not far a rising hillock stood in view
      sharp myrtles on the sides and cornels grew
      there while i went to crop the sylvan scenes
      and shade our altar with their leafy greens
      i pulld a plant with horror i relate
      a prodigy so strange and full of fate
      the rooted fibers rose and from the wound
      black bloody drops distilld upon the ground
      mute and amazd my hair with terror stood
      fear shrunk my sinews and congeald my blood
      mannd once again another plant i try
      that other gushd with the same sanguine dye
      then fearing guilt for some offence unknown
      with prayrs and vows the dryads i atone
      with all the sisters of the woods and most
      the god of arms who rules the thracian coast
      that they or he these omens would avert
      release our fears and better signs impart
      cleard as i thought and fully fixd at length
      to learn the cause i tugged with all my strength
      i bent my knees against the ground once more
      the violated myrtle ran with gore
      scarce dare i tell the sequel from the womb
      of wounded earth and caverns of the tomb
      a groan as of a troubled ghost renewd
      my fright and then these dreadful words ensued
      why dost thou thus my buried body rend
      o spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend
      spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood
      the tears distil not from the wounded wood
      but evry drop this living tree contains
      is kindred blood and ran in trojan veins
      o fly from this unhospitable shore
      warnd by my fate for i am polydore
      here loads of lances in my blood embrued
      again shoot upward by my blood renewd

      my faltring tongue and shivring limbs declare
      my horror and in bristles rose my hair
      when troy with grecian arms was closely pent
      old priam fearful of the wars event
      this hapless polydore to thracia sent
      loaded with gold he sent his darling far
      from noise and tumults and destructive war
      committed to the faithless tyrants care
      who when he saw the powr of troy decline
      forsook the weaker with the strong to join
      broke evry bond of nature and of truth
      and murderd for his wealth the royal youth
      o sacred hunger of pernicious gold
      what bands of faith can impious lucre hold
      now when my soul had shaken off her fears
      i call my father and the trojan peers
      relate the prodigies of heavn require
      what he commands and their advice desire
      all vote to leave that execrable shore
      polluted with the blood of polydore
      but ere we sail his funral rites prepare
      then to his ghost a tomb and altars rear
      in mournful pomp the matrons walk the round
      with baleful cypress and blue fillets crownd
      with eyes dejected and with hair unbound
      then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour
      and thrice invoke the soul of polydore

      now when the raging storms no longer reign
      but southern gales invite us to the main
      we launch our vessels with a prosprous wind
      and leave the cities and the shores behind

      an island in th aegaean main appears
      neptune and watry doris claim it theirs
      it floated once till phoebus fixd the sides
      to rooted earth and now it braves the tides
      here borne by friendly winds we come ashore
      with needful ease our weary limbs restore
      and the suns temple and his town adore

      anius the priest and king with laurel crownd
      his hoary locks with purple fillets bound
      who saw my sire the delian shore ascend
      came forth with eager haste to meet his friend
      invites him to his palace and in sign
      of ancient love their plighted hands they join
      then to the temple of the god i went
      and thus before the shrine my vows present
      give o thymbraeus give a resting place
      to the sad relics of the trojan race
      a seat secure a region of their own
      a lasting empire and a happier town
      where shall we fix where shall our labours end
      whom shall we follow and what fate attend
      let not my prayrs a doubtful answer find
      but in clear auguries unveil thy mind
      scarce had i said he shook the holy ground
      the laurels and the lofty hills around
      and from the tripos rushd a bellowing sound
      prostrate we fell confessd the present god
      who gave this answer from his dark abode
      undaunted youths go seek that mother earth
      from which your ancestors derive their birth
      the soil that sent you forth her ancient race
      in her old bosom shall again embrace
      through the wide world th aeneian house shall reign
      and childrens children shall the crown sustain
      thus phoebus did our future fates disclose
      a mighty tumult mixd with joy arose

      all are concernd to know what place the god
      assignd and where determind our abode
      my father long revolving in his mind
      the race and lineage of the trojan kind
      thus answerd their demands ye princes hear
      your pleasing fortune and dispel your fear
      the fruitful isle of crete well known to fame
      sacred of old to joves imperial name
      in the mid ocean lies with large command
      and on its plains a hundred cities stand
      another ida rises there and we
      from thence derive our trojan ancestry
      from thence as tis divulgd by certain fame
      to the rhoetean shores old teucrus came
      there fixd and there the seat of empire chose
      ere ilium and the trojan towrs arose
      in humble vales they built their soft abodes
      till cybele the mother of the gods
      with tinkling cymbals charmd th idaean woods
      she secret rites and ceremonies taught
      and to the yoke the savage lions brought
      let us the land which heavn appoints explore
      appease the winds and seek the gnossian shore
      if jove assists the passage of our fleet
      the third propitious dawn discovers crete
      thus having said the sacrifices laid
      on smoking altars to the gods he paid
      a bull to neptune an oblation due
      another bull to bright apollo slew
      a milkwhite ewe the western winds to please
      and one coalblack to calm the stormy seas
      ere this a flying rumour had been spread
      that fierce idomeneus from crete was fled
      expelld and exild that the coast was free
      from foreign or domestic enemy

      we leave the delian ports and put to sea
      by naxos famd for vintage make our way
      then green donysa pass and sail in sight
      of paros isle with marble quarries white
      we pass the scatterd isles of cyclades
      that scarce distinguishd seem to stud the seas
      the shouts of sailors double near the shores
      they stretch their canvas and they ply their oars
      all hands aloft for crete for crete they cry
      and swiftly thro the foamy billows fly
      full on the promisd land at length we bore
      with joy descending on the cretan shore
      with eager haste a rising town i frame
      which from the trojan pergamus i name
      the name itself was grateful i exhort
      to found their houses and erect a fort
      our ships are hauld upon the yellow strand
      the youth begin to till the labourd land
      and i myself new marriages promote
      give laws and dwellings i divide by lot
      when rising vapours choke the wholesome air
      and blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year
      the trees devouring caterpillars burn
      parchd was the grass and blighted was the corn
      nor scape the beasts for sirius from on high
      with pestilential heat infects the sky
      my men some fall the rest in fevers fry
      again my father bids me seek the shore
      of sacred delos and the god implore
      to learn what end of woes we might expect
      and to what clime our weary course direct

      twas night when evry creature void of cares
      the common gift of balmy slumber shares
      the statues of my gods 
      those gods whom i from flaming troy redeemd
      before me stood majestically bright
      full in the beams of phoebes entring light
      then thus they spoke and easd my troubled mind
      what from the delian god thou gost to find
      he tells thee here and sends us to relate
      those powrs are we companions of thy fate
      who from the burning town by thee were brought
      thy fortune followd and thy safety wrought
      thro seas and lands as we thy steps attend
      so shall our care thy glorious race befriend
      an ample realm for thee thy fates ordain
      a town that oer the conquerd world shall reign
      thou mighty walls for mighty nations build
      nor let thy weary mind to labours yield
      but change thy seat for not the delian god
      nor we have givn thee crete for our abode
      a land there is hesperia calld of old
      the soil is fruitful and the natives bold
      th oenotrians held it once by later fame
      now calld italia from the leaders name
      jasius there and dardanus were born
      from thence we came and thither must return
      rise and thy sire with these glad tidings greet
      search italy for jove denies thee crete

      astonishd at their voices and their sight
      
      i started from my couch a clammy sweat
      on all my limbs and shivring body sate
      to heavn i lift my hands with pious haste
      and sacred incense in the flames i cast
      thus to the gods their perfect honours done
      more cheerful to my good old sire i run
      and tell the pleasing news in little space
      he found his error of the double race
      not as before he deemd derivd from crete
      no more deluded by the doubtful seat
      then said o son turmoild in trojan fate
      such things as these cassandra did relate
      this day revives within my mind what she
      foretold of troy renewd in italy
      and latian lands but who could then have thought
      that phrygian gods to latium should be brought
      or who believd what mad cassandra taught
      now let us go where phoebus leads the way

      he said and we with glad consent obey
      forsake the seat and leaving few behind
      we spread our sails before the willing wind
      now from the sight of land our galleys move
      with only seas around and skies above
      when oer our heads descends a burst of rain
      and night with sable clouds involves the main
      the ruffling winds the foamy billows raise
      the scatterd fleet is forcd to sevral ways
      the face of heavn is ravishd from our eyes
      and in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies
      cast from our course we wander in the dark
      no stars to guide no point of land to mark
      evn palinurus no distinction found
      betwixt the night and day such darkness reignd around
      three starless nights the doubtful navy strays
      without distinction and three sunless days
      the fourth renews the light and from our shrouds
      we view a rising land like distant clouds
      the mountaintops confirm the pleasing sight
      and curling smoke ascending from their height
      the canvas falls their oars the sailors ply
      from the rude strokes the whirling waters fly
      at length i land upon the strophades
      safe from the danger of the stormy seas
      those isles are compassd by th ionian main
      the dire abode where the foul harpies reign
      forcd by the winged warriors to repair
      to their old homes and leave their costly fare
      monsters more fierce offended heavn neer sent
      from hells abyss for human punishment
      with virgin faces but with wombs obscene
      foul paunches and with ordure still unclean
      with claws for hands and looks for ever lean

      we landed at the port and soon beheld
      fat herds of oxen graze the flowry field
      and wanton goats without a keeper strayd
      with weapons we the welcome prey invade
      then call the gods for partners of our feast
      and jove himself the chief invited guest
      we spread the tables on the greensward ground
      we feed with hunger and the bowls go round
      when from the mountaintops with hideous cry
      and clattring wings the hungry harpies fly
      they snatch the meat defiling all they find
      and parting leave a loathsome stench behind
      close by a hollow rock again we sit
      new dress the dinner and the beds refit
      secure from sight beneath a pleasing shade
      where tufted trees a native arbour made
      again the holy fires on altars burn
      and once again the ravnous birds return
      or from the dark recesses where they lie
      or from another quarter of the sky
      with filthy claws their odious meal repeat
      and mix their loathsome ordures with their meat
      i bid my friends for vengeance then prepare
      and with the hellish nation wage the war
      they as commanded for the fight provide
      and in the grass their glittring weapons hide
      then when along the crooked shore we hear
      their clattring wings and saw the foes appear
      misenus sounds a charge we take th alarm
      and our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm
      in this new kind of combat all employ
      their utmost force the monsters to destroy
      in vain the fated skin is proof to wounds
      and from their plumes the shining sword rebounds
      at length rebuffd they leave their mangled prey
      and their stretchd pinions to the skies display
      yet one remaind the messenger of fate
      high on a craggy cliff celaeno sate
      and thus her dismal errand did relate
      what not contented with our oxen slain
      dare you with heavn an impious war maintain
      and drive the harpies from their native reign
      heed therefore what i say and keep in mind
      what jove decrees what phoebus has designd
      and i the furies queen from both relate
      you seek th italian shores foredoomd by fate
      th italian shores are granted you to find
      and a safe passage to the port assignd
      but know that ere your promisd walls you build
      my curses shall severely be fulfilld
      fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed
      reducd to grind the plates on which you feed
      she said and to the neighbring forest flew
      our courage fails us and our fears renew
      hopeless to win by war to prayrs we fall
      and on th offended harpies humbly call
      and whether gods or birds obscene they were
      our vows for pardon and for peace prefer
      but old anchises offring sacrifice
      and lifting up to heavn his hands and eyes
      adord the greater gods avert said he
      these omens render vain this prophecy
      and from th impending curse a pious people free

      thus having said he bids us put to sea
      we loose from shore our haulsers and obey
      and soon with swelling sails pursue the watry way
      amidst our course zacynthian woods appear
      and next by rocky neritos we steer
      we fly from ithacas detested shore
      and curse the land which dire ulysses bore
      at length leucates cloudy top appears
      and the suns temple which the sailor fears
      resolvd to breathe a while from labour past
      our crooked anchors from the prow we cast
      and joyful to the little city haste
      here safe beyond our hopes our vows we pay
      to jove the guide and patron of our way
      the customs of our country we pursue
      and trojan games on actian shores renew
      our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil
      and exercise the wrastlers noble toil
      pleasd to have saild so long before the wind
      and left so many grecian towns behind
      the sun had now fulfilld his annual course
      and boreas on the seas displayd his force
      i fixd upon the temples lofty door
      the brazen shield which vanquishd abas bore
      the verse beneath my name and action speaks
      these arms aeneas took from conquring greeks
      then i command to weigh the seamen ply
      their sweeping oars the smoking billows fly
      the sight of high phaeacia soon we lost
      and skimmd along epirus rocky coast

      then to chaonias port our course we bend
      and landed to buthrotus heights ascend
      here wondrous things were loudly blazd fame
      how helenus revivd the trojan name
      and reignd in greece that priams captive son
      succeeded pyrrhus in his bed and throne
      and fair andromache restord by fate
      once more was happy in a trojan mate
      i leave my galleys riding in the port
      and long to see the new dardanian court
      by chance the mournful queen before the gate
      then solemnizd her former husbands fate
      green altars raisd of turf with gifts she crownd
      and sacred priests in order stand around
      and thrice the name of hapless hector sound
      the grove itself resembles idas wood
      and simois seemd the welldissembled flood
      but when at nearer distance she beheld
      my shining armour and my trojan shield
      astonishd at the sight the vital heat
      forsakes her limbs her veins no longer beat
      she faints she falls and scarce recovring strength
      thus with a faltring tongue she speaks at length

      are you alive o goddessborn she said
      or if a ghost then where is hectors shade
      at this she cast a loud and frightful cry
      with broken words i made this brief reply
      all of me that remains appears in sight
      i live if living be to loathe the light
      no phantom but i drag a wretched life
      my fate resembling that of hectors wife
      what have you sufferd since you lost your lord
      by what strange blessing are you now restord
      still are you hectors or is hector fled
      and his remembrance lost in pyrrhus bed
      with eyes dejected in a lowly tone
      after a modest pause she thus begun

      o only happy maid of priams race
      whom death deliverd from the foes embrace
      commanded on achilles tomb to die
      not forcd like us to hard captivity
      or in a haughty masters arms to lie
      in grecian ships unhappy we were borne
      endurd the victors lust sustaind the scorn
      thus i submitted to the lawless pride
      of pyrrhus more a handmaid than a bride
      cloyd with possession he forsook my bed
      and helens lovely daughter sought to wed
      then me to trojan helenus resignd
      and his two slaves in equal marriage joind
      till young orestes piercd with deep despair
      and longing to redeem the promisd fair
      before apollos altar slew the ravisher
      by pyrrhus death the kingdom we regaind
      at least one half with helenus remaind
      our part from chaon he chaonia calls
      and names from pergamus his rising walls
      but you what fates have landed on our coast
      what gods have sent you or what storms have tossd
      does young ascanius life and health enjoy
      savd from the ruins of unhappy troy
      o tell me how his mothers loss he bears
      what hopes are promisd from his blooming years
      how much of hector in his face appears
      she spoke and mixd her speech with mournful cries
      and fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes

      at length her lord descends upon the plain
      in pomp attended with a numrous train
      receives his friends and to the city leads
      and tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds
      proceeding on another troy i see
      or in less compass troys epitome
      a rivlet by the name of xanthus ran
      and i embrace the scaean gate again
      my friends in porticoes were entertaind
      and feasts and pleasures thro the city reignd
      the tables filld the spacious hall around
      and golden bowls with sparkling wine were crownd
      two days we passd in mirth till friendly gales
      blown from the south supplied our swelling sails
      then to the royal seer i thus began
      o thou who knowst beyond the reach of man
      the laws of heavn and what the stars decree
      whom phoebus taught unerring prophecy
      from his own tripod and his holy tree
      skilld in the wingd inhabitants of air
      what auspices their notes and flights declare
      o say for all religious rites portend
      a happy voyage and a prosprous end
      and evry power and omen of the sky
      direct my course for destind italy
      but only dire celaeno from the gods
      a dismal famine fatally forebodes
      o say what dangers i am first to shun
      what toils vanquish and what course to run

      the prophet first with sacrifice adores
      the greater gods their pardon then implores
      unbinds the fillet from his holy head
      to phoebus next my trembling steps he led
      full of religious doubts and awful dread
      then with his god possessd before the shrine
      these words proceeded from his mouth divine
      o goddessborn 
      of many things some few i shall explain
      teach thee to shun the dangers of the main
      and how at length the promisd shore to gain
      the rest the fates from helenus conceal
      and junos angry powr forbids to tell
      first then that happy shore that seems so nigh
      will far from your deluded wishes fly
      long tracts of seas divide your hopes from italy
      for you must cruise along sicilian shores
      and stem the currents with your struggling oars
      then round th italian coast your navy steer
      and after this to circes island veer
      and last before your new foundations rise
      must pass the stygian lake and view the nether skies
      now mark the signs of future ease and rest
      and bear them safely treasurd in thy breast
      when in the shady shelter of a wood
      and near the margin of a gentle flood
      thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground
      with thirty sucking young encompassd round
      the dam and offspring white as falling snow
      these on thy city shall their name bestow
      and there shall end thy labours and thy woe
      nor let the threatend famine fright thy mind
      for phoebus will assist and fate the way will find
      let not thy course to that ill coast be bent
      which fronts from far th epirian continent
      those parts are all by grecian foes possessd
      the salvage locrians here the shores infest
      there fierce idomeneus his city builds
      and guards with arms the salentinian fields
      and on the mountains brow petilia stands
      which philoctetes with his troops commands
      evn when thy fleet is landed on the shore
      and priests with holy vows the gods adore
      then with a purple veil involve your eyes
      lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice
      these rites and customs to the rest commend
      that to your pious race they may descend

      when parted hence the wind that ready waits
      for sicily shall bear you to the straits
      where proud pelorus opes a wider way
      tack to the larboard and stand off to sea
      veer starboard sea and land th italian shore
      and fair sicilias coast were one before
      an earthquake causd the flaw the roaring tides
      the passage broke that land from land divides
      and where the lands retird the rushing ocean rides
      distinguishd by the straits on either hand
      now rising cities in long order stand
      and fruitful fields so much can time invade
      the mouldring work that beauteous nature made
      far on the right her dogs foul scylla hides
      charybdis roaring on the left presides
      and in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides
      then spouts them from below with fury drivn
      the waves mount up and wash the face of heavn
      but scylla from her den with open jaws
      the sinking vessel in her eddy draws
      then dashes on the rocks a human face
      and virgin bosom hides her tails disgrace
      her parts obscene below the waves descend
      with dogs inclosd and in a dolphin end
      tis safer then to bear aloof to sea
      and coast pachynus tho with more delay
      than once to view misshapen scylla near
      and the loud yell of watry wolves to hear

      besides if faith to helenus be due
      and if prophetic phoebus tell me true
      do not this precept of your friend forget
      which therefore more than once i must repeat
      above the rest great junos name adore
      pay vows to juno junos aid implore
      let gifts be to the mighty queen designd
      and mollify with prayrs her haughty mind
      thus at the length your passage shall be free
      and you shall safe descend on italy
      arrivd at cumae when you view the flood
      of black avernus and the sounding wood
      the mad prophetic sibyl you shall find
      dark in a cave and on a rock reclind
      she sings the fates and in her frantic fits
      the notes and names inscribd to leafs commits
      what she commits to leafs in order laid
      before the caverns entrance are displayd
      unmovd they lie but if a blast of wind
      without or vapours issue from behind
      the leafs are borne aloft in liquid air
      and she resumes no more her museful care
      nor gathers from the rocks her scatterd verse
      nor sets in order what the winds disperse
      thus many not succeeding most upbraid
      the madness of the visionary maid
      and with loud curses leave the mystic shade

      think it not loss of time a while to stay
      tho thy companions chide thy long delay
      tho summond to the seas tho pleasing gales
      invite thy course and stretch thy swelling sails
      but beg the sacred priestess to relate
      with willing words and not to write thy fate
      the fierce italian people she will show
      and all thy wars and all thy future woe
      and what thou mayst avoid and what must undergo
      she shall direct thy course instruct thy mind
      and teach thee how the happy shores to find
      this is what heavn allows me to relate
      now part in peace pursue thy better fate
      and raise by strength of arms the trojan state

      this when the priest with friendly voice declard
      he gave me license and rich gifts prepard
      bounteous of treasure he supplied my want
      with heavy gold and polishd elephant
      then dodonaean caldrons put on board
      and evry ship with sums of silver stord
      a trusty coat of mail to me he sent
      thrice chaind with gold for use and ornament
      the helm of pyrrhus added to the rest
      that flourishd with a plume and waving crest
      nor was my sire forgotten nor my friends
      and large recruits he to my navy sends
      men horses captains arms and warlike stores
      supplies new pilots and new sweeping oars
      meantime my sire commands to hoist our sails
      lest we should lose the first auspicious gales

      the prophet blessd the parting crew and last
      with words like these his ancient friend embracd
      old happy man the care of gods above
      whom heavnly venus honourd with her love
      and twice preservd thy life when troy was lost
      behold from far the wishd ausonian coast
      there land but take a larger compass round
      for that before is all forbidden ground
      the shore that phoebus has designd for you
      at farther distance lies conceald from view
      go happy hence and seek your new abodes
      blest in a son and favourd by the gods
      for i with useless words prolong your stay
      when southern gales have summond you away

      nor less the queen our parting thence deplord
      nor was less bounteous than her trojan lord
      a noble present to my son she brought
      a robe with flowrs on golden tissue wrought
      a phrygian vest and loads with gifts beside
      of precious texture and of asian pride
      accept she said these monuments of love
      which in my youth with happier hands i wove
      regard these trifles for the givers sake
      tis the last present hectors wife can make
      thou callst my lost astyanax to mind
      in thee his features and his form i find
      his eyes so sparkled with a lively flame
      such were his motions such was all his frame
      and ah had heavn so pleasd his years had been the same

      with tears i took my last adieu and said
      your fortune happy pair already made
      leaves you no farther wish my diffrent state
      avoiding one incurs another fate
      to you a quiet seat the gods allow
      you have no shores to search no seas to plow
      nor fields of flying italy to chase
      
      you see another simois and enjoy
      the labour of your hands another troy
      with better auspice than her ancient towrs
      and less obnoxious to the grecian powrs
      if eer the gods whom i with vows adore
      conduct my steps to tibers happy shore
      if ever i ascend the latian throne
      and build a city i may call my own
      as both of us our birth from troy derive
      so let our kindred lines in concord live
      and both in acts of equal friendship strive
      our fortunes good or bad shall be the same
      the double troy shall differ but in name
      that what we now begin may never end
      but long to late posterity descend

      near the ceraunian rocks our course we bore
      the shortest passage to th italian shore
      now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light
      and hills were hid in dusky shades of night
      we land and on the bosom of the ground
      a safe retreat and a bare lodging found
      close by the shore we lay the sailors keep
      their watches and the rest securely sleep
      the night proceeding on with silent pace
      stood in her noon and viewd with equal face
      her steepy rise and her declining race
      then wakeful palinurus rose to spy
      the face of heavn and the nocturnal sky
      and listend evry breath of air to try
      observes the stars and notes their sliding course
      the pleiads hyads and their watry force
      and both the bears is careful to behold
      and bright orion armd with burnishd gold
      then when he saw no threatning tempest nigh
      but a sure promise of a settled sky
      he gave the sign to weigh we break our sleep
      forsake the pleasing shore and plow the deep

      and now the rising morn with rosy light
      adorns the skies and puts the stars to flight
      when we from far like bluish mists descry
      the hills and then the plains of italy
      achates first pronouncd the joyful sound
      then italy the cheerful crew rebound
      my sire anchises crownd a cup with wine
      and offring thus implord the powrs divine
      ye gods presiding over lands and seas
      and you who raging winds and waves appease
      breathe on our swelling sails a prosprous wind
      and smooth our passage to the port assignd
      the gentle gales their flagging force renew
      and now the happy harbour is in view
      minervas temple then salutes our sight
      placd as a landmark on the mountains height
      we furl our sails and turn the prows to shore
      the curling waters round the galleys roar
      the land lies open to the raging east
      then bending like a bow with rocks compressd
      shuts out the storms the winds and waves complain
      and vent their malice on the cliffs in vain
      the port lies hid within on either side
      two towring rocks the narrow mouth divide
      the temple which aloft we viewd before
      to distance flies and seems to shun the shore
      scarce landed the first omens i beheld
      were four white steeds that croppd the flowry field
      war war is threatend from this foreign ground
      my father cried where warlike steeds are found
      yet since reclaimd to chariots they submit
      and bend to stubborn yokes and champ the bit
      peace may succeed to war our way we bend
      to pallas and the sacred hill ascend
      there prostrate to the fierce virago pray
      whose temple was the landmark of our way
      each with a phrygian mantle veild his head
      and all commands of helenus obeyd
      and pious rites to grecian juno paid
      these dues performd we stretch our sails and stand
      to sea forsaking that suspected land

      from hence tarentums bay appears in view
      for hercules renownd if fame be true
      just opposite lacinian juno stands
      caulonian towrs and scylacaean strands
      for shipwrecks feard mount aetna thence we spy
      known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky
      far off we hear the waves with surly sound
      invade the rocks the rocks their groans rebound
      the billows break upon the sounding strand
      and roll the rising tide impure with sand
      then thus anchises in experience old
      tis that charybdis which the seer foretold
      and those the promisd rocks bear off to sea
      with haste the frighted mariners obey
      first palinurus to the larboard veerd
      then all the fleet by his example steerd
      to heavn aloft on ridgy waves we ride
      then down to hell descend when they divide
      and thrice our galleys knockd the stony ground
      and thrice the hollow rocks returnd the sound
      and thrice we saw the stars that stood with dews around
      the flagging winds forsook us with the sun
      and wearied on cyclopian shores we run
      the port capacious and secure from wind
      is to the foot of thundring aetna joind
      by turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high
      by turns hot embers from her entrails fly
      and flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky
      oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown
      and shiverd by the force come piecemeal down
      oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow
      fed from the fiery springs that boil below
      enceladus they say transfixd by jove
      with blasted limbs came tumbling from above
      and where he fell th avenging father drew
      this flaming hill and on his body threw
      as often as he turns his weary sides
      he shakes the solid isle and smoke the heavens hides
      in shady woods we pass the tedious night
      where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright
      of which no cause is offerd to the sight
      for not one star was kindled in the sky
      nor could the moon her borrowd light supply
      for misty clouds involvd the firmament
      the stars were muffled and the moon was pent

      scarce had the rising sun the day reveald
      scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispelld
      when from the woods there bolts before our sight
      somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite
      so thin so ghastly meager and so wan
      so bare of flesh he scarce resembled man
      this thing all tatterd seemd from far timplore
      our pious aid and pointed to the shore
      we look behind then view his shaggy beard
      his clothes were taggd with thorns and filth his limbs
      besmeard
      the rest in mien in habit and in face
      appeard a greek and such indeed he was
      he cast on us from far a frightful view
      whom soon for trojans and for foes he knew
      stood still and pausd then all at once began
      to stretch his limbs and trembled as he ran
      soon as approachd upon his knees he falls
      and thus with tears and sighs for pity calls
      now by the powrs above and what we share
      from natures common gift this vital air
      o trojans take me hence i beg no more
      but bear me far from this unhappy shore
      tis true i am a greek and farther own
      among your foes besiegd th imperial town
      for such demerits if my death be due
      no more for this abandond life i sue
      this only favour let my tears obtain
      to throw me headlong in the rapid main
      since nothing more than death my crime demands
      i die content to die by human hands
      he said and on his knees my knees embracd
      i bade him boldly tell his fortune past
      his present state his lineage and his name
      th occasion of his fears and whence he came
      the good anchises raisd him with his hand
      who thus encouragd answerd our demand
      from ithaca my native soil i came
      to troy and achaemenides my name
      me my poor father with ulysses sent
      
      but fearful for themselves my countrymen
      left me forsaken in the cyclops den
      the cave tho large was dark the dismal floor
      was pavd with mangled limbs and putrid gore
      our monstrous host of more than human size
      erects his head and stares within the skies
      bellowing his voice and horrid is his hue
      ye gods remove this plague from mortal view
      the joints of slaughterd wretches are his food
      and for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood
      these eyes beheld when with his spacious hand
      he seizd two captives of our grecian band
      stretchd on his back he dashd against the stones
      their broken bodies and their crackling bones
      with spouting blood the purple pavement swims
      while the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs

      not unrevengd ulysses bore their fate
      nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state
      for gorgd with flesh and drunk with human wine
      while fast asleep the giant lay supine
      snoring aloud and belching from his maw
      his indigested foam and morsels raw
      we pray we cast the lots and then surround
      the monstrous body stretchd along the ground
      each as he could approach him lends a hand
      to bore his eyeball with a flaming brand
      beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye
      for only one did the vast frame supply
      but that a globe so large his front it filld
      like the suns disk or like a grecian shield
      the stroke succeeds and down the pupil bends
      this vengeance followd for our slaughterd friends
      but haste unhappy wretches haste to fly
      your cables cut and on your oars rely
      such and so vast as polypheme appears
      a hundred more this hated island bears
      like him in caves they shut their woolly sheep
      like him their herds on tops of mountains keep
      like him with mighty strides they stalk from steep to steep
      and now three moons their sharpend horns renew
      since thus in woods and wilds obscure from view
      i drag my loathsome days with mortal fright
      and in deserted caverns lodge by night
      oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
      of the huge cyclops like a walking tree
      from far i hear his thundring voice resound
      and trampling feet that shake the solid ground
      cornels and salvage berries of the wood
      and roots and herbs have been my meager food
      while all around my longing eyes i cast
      i saw your happy ships appear at last
      on those i fixd my hopes to these i run
      tis all i ask this cruel race to shun
      what other death you please yourselves bestow

      scarce had he said when on the mountains brow
      we saw the giant shepherd stalk before
      his following flock and leading to the shore
      a monstrous bulk deformd deprivd of sight
      his staff a trunk of pine to guide his steps aright
      his pondrous whistle from his neck descends
      his woolly care their pensive lord attends
      this only solace his hard fortune sends
      soon as he reachd the shore and touchd the waves
      from his bord eye the guttring blood he laves
      he gnashd his teeth and groand thro seas he strides
      and scarce the topmost billows touchd his sides

      seizd with a sudden fear we run to sea
      the cables cut and silent haste away
      the welldeserving stranger entertain
      then buckling to the work our oars divide the main
      the giant harkend to the dashing sound
      but when our vessels out of reach he found
      he strided onward and in vain essayd
      th ionian deep and durst no farther wade
      with that he roard aloud the dreadful cry
      shakes earth and air and seas the billows fly
      before the bellowing noise to distant italy
      the neighbring aetna trembling all around
      the winding caverns echo to the sound
      his brother cyclops hear the yelling roar
      and rushing down the mountains crowd the shore
      we saw their stern distorted looks from far
      and oneeyed glance that vainly threatend war
      a dreadful council with their heads on high
      
      not yielding to the towring tree of jove
      or tallest cypress of dianas grove
      new pangs of mortal fear our minds assail
      we tug at evry oar and hoist up evry sail
      and take th advantage of the friendly gale
      forewarnd by helenus we strive to shun
      charybdis gulf nor dare to scylla run
      an equal fate on either side appears
      we tacking to the left are free from fears
      for from pelorus point the north arose
      and drove us back where swift pantagias flows
      his rocky mouth we pass and make our way
      by thapsus and megaras winding bay
      this passage achaemenides had shown
      tracing the course which he before had run

      right oer against plemmyriums watry strand
      there lies an isle once calld th ortygian land
      alpheus as old fame reports has found
      from greece a secret passage under ground
      by love to beauteous arethusa led
      and mingling here they roll in the same sacred bed
      as helenus enjoind we next adore
      dianas name protectress of the shore
      with prosprous gales we pass the quiet sounds
      of still elorus and his fruitful bounds
      then doubling cape pachynus we survey
      the rocky shore extended to the sea
      the town of camarine from far we see
      and fenny lake undraind by fates decree
      in sight of the geloan fields we pass
      and the large walls where mighty gela was
      then agragas with lofty summits crownd
      long for the race of warlike steeds renownd
      we passd selinus and the palmy land
      and widely shun the lilybaean strand
      unsafe for secret rocks and moving sand
      at length on shore the weary fleet arrivd
      which drepanums unhappy port receivd
      here after endless labours often tossd
      by raging storms and drivn on evry coast
      my dear dear father spent with age i lost
      ease of my cares and solace of my pain
      savd thro a thousand toils but savd in vain
      the prophet who my future woes reveald
      yet this the greatest and the worst conceald
      and dire celaeno whose foreboding skill
      denouncd all else was silent of the ill
      this my last labour was some friendly god
      from thence conveyd us to your blest abode

      thus to the listning queen the royal guest
      his wandring course and all his toils expressd
      and here concluding he retird to rest



 

      but anxious cares already seizd the queen
      she fed within her veins a flame unseen
      the heros valour acts and birth inspire
      her soul with love and fan the secret fire
      his words his looks imprinted in her heart
      improve the passion and increase the smart
      now when the purple morn had chasd away
      the dewy shadows and restord the day
      her sister first with early care she sought
      and thus in mournful accents easd her thought

      my dearest anna what new dreams affright
      my labring soul what visions of the night
      disturb my quiet and distract my breast
      with strange ideas of our trojan guest
      his worth his actions and majestic air
      a man descended from the gods declare
      fear ever argues a degenerate kind
      his birth is well asserted by his mind
      then what he sufferd when by fate betrayd
      what brave attempts for falling troy he made
      such were his looks so gracefully he spoke
      that were i not resolvd against the yoke
      of hapless marriage never to be curst
      with second love so fatal was my first
      to this one error i might yield again
      for since sichaeus was untimely slain
      this only man is able to subvert
      the fixd foundations of my stubborn heart
      and to confess my frailty to my shame
      somewhat i find within if not the same
      too like the sparkles of my former flame
      but first let yawning earth a passage rend
      and let me thro the dark abyss descend
      first let avenging jove with flames from high
      drive down this body to the nether sky
      condemnd with ghosts in endless night to lie
      before i break the plighted faith i gave
      no he who had my vows shall ever have
      for whom i lovd on earth i worship in the grave

      she said the tears ran gushing from her eyes
      and stoppd her speech her sister thus replies
      o dearer than the vital air i breathe
      will you to grief your blooming years bequeath
      condemnd to waste in woes your lonely life
      without the joys of mother or of wife
      think you these tears this pompous train of woe
      are known or valued by the ghosts below
      i grant that while your sorrows yet were green
      it well became a woman and a queen
      the vows of tyrian princes to neglect
      to scorn hyarbas and his love reject
      with all the libyan lords of mighty name
      but will you fight against a pleasing flame
      this little spot of land which heavn bestows
      on evry side is hemmd with warlike foes
      gaetulian cities here are spread around
      and fierce numidians there your frontiers bound
      here lies a barren waste of thirsty land
      and there the syrtes raise the moving sand
      barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore
      and from the sea pygmalion threatens more
      propitious heavn and gracious juno lead
      this wandring navy to your needful aid
      how will your empire spread your city rise
      from such a union and with such allies
      implore the favour of the powrs above
      and leave the conduct of the rest to love
      continue still your hospitable way
      and still invent occasions of their stay
      till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat
      and planks and oars repair their shatterd fleet

      these words which from a friend and sister came
      with ease resolvd the scruples of her fame
      and added fury to the kindled flame
      inspird with hope the project they pursue
      on evry altar sacrifice renew
      a chosen ewe of two years old they pay
      to ceres bacchus and the god of day
      preferring junos powr for juno ties
      the nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys
      the beauteous queen before her altar stands
      and holds the golden goblet in her hands
      a milkwhite heifer she with flowrs adorns
      and pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns
      and while the priests with prayr the gods invoke
      she feeds their altars with sabaean smoke
      with hourly care the sacrifice renews
      and anxiously the panting entrails views
      what priestly rites alas what pious art
      what vows avail to cure a bleeding heart
      a gentle fire she feeds within her veins
      where the soft god secure in silence reigns

      sick with desire and seeking him she loves
      from street to street the raving dido roves
      so when the watchful shepherd from the blind
      wounds with a random shaft the careless hind
      distracted with her pain she flies the woods
      bounds oer the lawn and seeks the silent floods
      with fruitless care for still the fatal dart
      sticks in her side and rankles in her heart
      and now she leads the trojan chief along
      the lofty walls amidst the busy throng
      displays her tyrian wealth and rising town
      which love without his labour makes his own
      this pomp she shows to tempt her wandring guest
      her faltring tongue forbids to speak the rest
      when day declines and feasts renew the night
      still on his face she feeds her famishd sight
      she longs again to hear the prince relate
      his own adventures and the trojan fate
      he tells it oer and oer but still in vain
      for still she begs to hear it once again
      the hearer on the speakers mouth depends
      and thus the tragic story never ends

      then when they part when phoebes paler light
      withdraws and falling stars to sleep invite
      she last remains when evry guest is gone
      sits on the bed he pressd and sighs alone
      absent her absent hero sees and hears
      or in her bosom young ascanius bears
      and seeks the fathers image in the child
      if love by likeness might be so beguild

      meantime the rising towrs are at a stand
      no labours exercise the youthful band
      nor use of arts nor toils of arms they know
      the mole is left unfinishd to the foe
      the mounds the works the walls neglected lie
      short of their promisd heighth that seemd to threat the sky

      but when imperial juno from above
      saw dido fetterd in the chains of love
      hot with the venom which her veins inflamd
      and by no sense of shame to be reclaimd
      with soothing words to venus she begun
      high praises endless honours you have won
      and mighty trophies with your worthy son
      two gods a silly woman have undone
      nor am i ignorant you both suspect
      this rising city which my hands erect
      but shall celestial discord never cease
      tis better ended in a lasting peace
      you stand possessd of all your soul desird
      poor dido with consuming love is fird
      your trojan with my tyrian let us join
      so dido shall be yours aeneas mine
      one common kingdom one united line
      eliza shall a dardan lord obey
      and lofty carthage for a dowr convey
      then venus who her hidden fraud descried
      which would the scepter of the world misguide
      to libyan shores thus artfully replied
      who but a fool would wars with juno choose
      and such alliance and such gifts refuse
      if fortune with our joint desires comply
      the doubt is all from jove and destiny
      lest he forbid with absolute command
      to mix the people in one common land
      or will the trojan and the tyrian line
      in lasting leagues and sure succession join
      but you the partner of his bed and throne
      may move his mind my wishes are your own

      mine said imperial juno be the care
      time urges now to perfect this affair
      attend my counsel and the secret share
      when next the sun his rising light displays
      and gilds the world below with purple rays
      the queen aeneas and the tyrian court
      shall to the shady woods for sylvan game resort
      there while the huntsmen pitch their toils around
      and cheerful horns from side to side resound
      a pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
      with hail and thunder and tempestuous rain
      the fearful train shall take their speedy flight
      dispersd and all involvd in gloomy night
      one cave a grateful shelter shall afford
      to the fair princess and the trojan lord
      i will myself the bridal bed prepare
      if you to bless the nuptials will be there
      so shall their loves be crownd with due delights
      and hymen shall be present at the rites
      the queen of love consents and closely smiles
      at her vain project and discoverd wiles

      the rosy morn was risen from the main
      and horns and hounds awake the princely train
      they issue early thro the city gate
      where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait
      with nets and toils and darts beside the force
      of spartan dogs and swift massylian horse
      the tyrian peers and officers of state
      for the slow queen in antechambers wait
      her lofty courser in the court below
      who his majestic rider seems to know
      proud of his purple trappings paws the ground
      and champs the golden bit and spreads the foam around
      the queen at length appears on either hand
      the brawny guards in martial order stand
      a flowrd simar with golden fringe she wore
      and at her back a golden quiver bore
      her flowing hair a golden caul restrains
      a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains
      then young ascanius with a sprightly grace
      leads on the trojan youth to view the chase
      but far above the rest in beauty shines
      the great aeneas the troop he joins
      like fair apollo when he leaves the frost
      of wintry xanthus and the lycian coast
      when to his native delos he resorts
      ordains the dances and renews the sports
      where painted scythians mixd with cretan bands
      before the joyful altars join their hands
      himself on cynthus walking sees below
      the merry madness of the sacred show
      green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose
      a golden fillet binds his awful brows
      his quiver sounds not less the prince is seen
      in manly presence or in lofty mien

      now had they reachd the hills and stormd the seat
      of salvage beasts in dens their last retreat
      the cry pursues the mountain goats they bound
      from rock to rock and keep the craggy ground
      quite otherwise the stags a trembling train
      in herds unsingled scour the dusty plain
      and a long chase in open view maintain
      the glad ascanius as his courser guides
      spurs thro the vale and these and those outrides
      his horses flanks and sides are forcd to feel
      the clanking lash and goring of the steel
      impatiently he views the feeble prey
      wishing some nobler beast to cross his way
      and rather would the tusky boar attend
      or see the tawny lion downward bend

      meantime the gathring clouds obscure the skies
      from pole to pole the forky lightning flies
      the rattling thunders roll and juno pours
      a wintry deluge down and sounding showrs
      the company dispersd to converts ride
      and seek the homely cots or mountains hollow side
      the rapid rains descending from the hills
      to rolling torrents raise the creeping rills
      the queen and prince as love or fortune guides
      one common cavern in her bosom hides
      then first the trembling earth the signal gave
      and flashing fires enlighten all the cave
      hell from below and juno from above
      and howling nymphs were conscious of their love
      from this illomend hour in time arose
      debate and death and all succeeding woes

      the queen whom sense of honour could not move
      no longer made a secret of her love
      but calld it marriage by that specious name
      to veil the crime and sanctify the shame

      the loud report thro libyan cities goes
      fame the great ill from small beginnings grows
      swift from the first and evry moment brings
      new vigour to her flights new pinions to her wings
      soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size
      her feet on earth her forehead in the skies
      inragd against the gods revengeful earth
      producd her last of the titanian birth
      swift is her walk more swift her winged haste
      a monstrous phantom horrible and vast
      as many plumes as raise her lofty flight
      so many piercing eyes inlarge her sight
      millions of opening mouths to fame belong
      and evry mouth is furnishd with a tongue
      and round with listning ears the flying plague is hung
      she fills the peaceful universe with cries
      no slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes
      by day from lofty towrs her head she shews
      and spreads thro trembling crowds disastrous news
      with court informers haunts and royal spies
      things done relates not done she feigns and mingles truth with
      lies

      talk is her business and her chief delight
      to tell of prodigies and cause affright
      she fills the peoples ears with didos name
      who lost to honour and the sense of shame
      admits into her throne and nuptial bed
      a wandring guest who from his country fled
      whole days with him she passes in delights
      and wastes in luxury long winter nights
      forgetful of her fame and royal trust
      dissolvd in ease abandond to her lust

      the goddess widely spreads the loud report
      and flies at length to king hyarbas court
      when first possessd with this unwelcome news
      whom did he not of men and gods accuse
      this prince from ravishd garamantis born
      a hundred temples did with spoils adorn
      in ammons honour his celestial sire
      a hundred altars fed with wakeful fire
      and thro his vast dominions priests ordaind
      whose watchful care these holy rites maintaind
      the gates and columns were with garlands crownd
      and blood of victim beasts enrichd the ground

      he when he heard a fugitive could move
      the tyrian princess who disdaind his love
      his breast with fury burnd his eyes with fire
      mad with despair impatient with desire
      then on the sacred altars pouring wine
      he thus with prayrs implord his sire divine
      great jove propitious to the moorish race
      who feast on painted beds with offrings grace
      thy temples and adore thy powr divine
      with blood of victims and with sparkling wine
      seest thou not this or do we fear in vain
      thy boasted thunder and thy thoughtless reign
      do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance
      thine are the bolts or the blind work of chance
      a wandring woman builds within our state
      a little town bought at an easy rate
      she pays me homage and my grants allow
      a narrow space of libyan lands to plow
      yet scorning me by passion blindly led
      admits a banishd trojan to her bed
      and now this other paris with his train
      of conquerd cowards must in afric reign
      
      he takes the spoil enjoys the princely dame
      and i rejected i adore an empty name

      his vows in haughty terms he thus preferrd
      and held his altars horns the mighty thundrer heard
      then cast his eyes on carthage where he found
      the lustful pair in lawless pleasure drownd
      lost in their loves insensible of shame
      and both forgetful of their better fame
      he calls cyllenius and the god attends
      by whom his menacing command he sends
      go mount the western winds and cleave the sky
      then with a swift descent to carthage fly
      there find the trojan chief who wastes his days
      in slothful riot and inglorious ease
      nor minds the future city givn by fate
      to him this message from my mouth relate
      not so fair venus hopd when twice she won
      thy life with prayrs nor promisd such a son
      hers was a hero destind to command
      a martial race and rule the latian land
      who should his ancient line from teucer draw
      and on the conquerd world impose the law
      if glory cannot move a mind so mean
      nor future praise from fading pleasure wean
      yet why should he defraud his son of fame
      and grudge the romans their immortal name
      what are his vain designs what hopes he more
      from his long lingring on a hostile shore
      regardless to redeem his honour lost
      and for his race to gain th ausonian coast
      bid him with speed the tyrian court forsake
      with this command the slumbring warrior wake

      hermes obeys with golden pinions binds
      his flying feet and mounts the western winds
      and whether oer the seas or earth he flies
      with rapid force they bear him down the skies
      but first he grasps within his awful hand
      the mark of sovreign powr his magic wand
      with this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves
      with this he drives them down the stygian waves
      with this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight
      and eyes tho closd in death restores to light
      thus armd the god begins his airy race
      and drives the racking clouds along the liquid space
      now sees the tops of atlas as he flies
      whose brawny back supports the starry skies
      atlas whose head with piny forests crownd
      is beaten by the winds with foggy vapours bound
      snows hide his shoulders from beneath his chin
      the founts of rolling streams their race begin
      a beard of ice on his large breast depends
      here poisd upon his wings the god descends
      then rested thus he from the towring height
      plungd downward with precipitated flight
      lights on the seas and skims along the flood
      as waterfowl who seek their fishy food
      less and yet less to distant prospect show
      by turns they dance aloft and dive below
      like these the steerage of his wings he plies
      and near the surface of the water flies
      till having passd the seas and crossd the sands
      he closd his wings and stoopd on libyan lands
      where shepherds once were housd in homely sheds
      now towrs within the clouds advance their heads
      arriving there he found the trojan prince
      new ramparts raising for the towns defence
      a purple scarf with gold embroiderd oer
       about his waist he wore
      a sword with glittring gems diversified
      for ornament not use hung idly by his side

      then thus with winged words the god began
      resuming his own shape degenerate man
      thou womans property what makst thou here
      these foreign walls and tyrian towrs to rear
      forgetful of thy own allpowrful jove
      who sways the world below and heavn above
      has sent me down with this severe command
      what means thy lingring in the libyan land
      if glory cannot move a mind so mean
      nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean
      regard the fortunes of thy rising heir
      the promisd crown let young ascanius wear
      to whom th ausonian scepter and the state
      of romes imperial name is owd by fate
      so spoke the god and speaking took his flight
      involvd in clouds and vanishd out of sight

      the pious prince was seizd with sudden fear
      mute was his tongue and upright stood his hair
      revolving in his mind the stern command
      he longs to fly and loathes the charming land
      what should he say or how should he begin
      what course alas remains to steer between
      th offended lover and the powrful queen
      this way and that he turns his anxious mind
      and all expedients tries and none can find
      fixd on the deed but doubtful of the means
      after long thought to this advice he leans
      three chiefs he calls commands them to repair
      the fleet and ship their men with silent care
      some plausible pretence he bids them find
      to colour what in secret he designd
      himself meantime the softest hours would choose
      before the lovesick lady heard the news
      and move her tender mind by slow degrees
      to suffer what the sovreign powr decrees
      jove will inspire him when and what to say
      they hear with pleasure and with haste obey

      but soon the queen perceives the thin disguise
      
      she was the first to find the secret fraud
      before the fatal news was blazd abroad
      love the first motions of the lover hears
      quick to presage and evn in safety fears
      nor impious fame was wanting to report
      the ships repaird the trojans thick resort
      and purpose to forsake the tyrian court
      frantic with fear impatient of the wound
      and impotent of mind she roves the city round
      less wild the bacchanalian dames appear
      when from afar their nightly god they hear
      and howl about the hills and shake the wreathy spear
      at length she finds the dear perfidious man
      prevents his formd excuse and thus began
      base and ungrateful could you hope to fly
      and undiscoverd scape a lovers eye
      nor could my kindness your compassion move
      nor plighted vows nor dearer bands of love
      or is the death of a despairing queen
      not worth preventing tho too well foreseen
      evn when the wintry winds command your stay
      you dare the tempests and defy the sea
      false as you are suppose you were not bound
      to lands unknown and foreign coasts to sound
      were troy restord and priams happy reign
      now durst you tempt for troy the raging main
      see whom you fly am i the foe you shun
      now by those holy vows so late begun
      by this right hand 
      i beg you by these tears too truly shed
      by the new pleasures of our nuptial bed
      if ever dido when you most were kind
      were pleasing in your eyes or touchd your mind
      by these my prayrs if prayrs may yet have place
      pity the fortunes of a falling race
      for you i have provokd a tyrants hate
      incensd the libyan and the tyrian state
      for you alone i suffer in my fame
      bereft of honour and exposd to shame
      whom have i now to trust ungrateful guest
      
      what have i left or whither can i fly
      must i attend pygmalions cruelty
      or till hyarba shall in triumph lead
      a queen that proudly scornd his profferd bed
      had you deferrd at least your hasty flight
      and left behind some pledge of our delight
      some babe to bless the mothers mournful sight
      some young aeneas to supply your place
      whose features might express his fathers face
      i should not then complain to live bereft
      of all my husband or be wholly left

      here pausd the queen unmovd he holds his eyes
      by joves command nor sufferd love to rise
      tho heaving in his heart and thus at length replies
      fair queen you never can enough repeat
      your boundless favours or i own my debt
      nor can my mind forget elizas name
      while vital breath inspires this mortal frame
      this only let me speak in my defence
      i never hopd a secret flight from hence
      much less pretended to the lawful claim
      of sacred nuptials or a husbands name
      for if indulgent heavn would leave me free
      and not submit my life to fates decree
      my choice would lead me to the trojan shore
      those relics to review their dust adore
      and priams ruind palace to restore
      but now the delphian oracle commands
      and fate invites me to the latian lands
      that is the promisd place to which i steer
      and all my vows are terminated there
      if you a tyrian and a stranger born
      with walls and towrs a libyan town adorn
      why may not we like you a foreign race
      like you seek shelter in a foreign place
      as often as the night obscures the skies
      with humid shades or twinkling stars arise
      anchises angry ghost in dreams appears
      chides my delay and fills my soul with fears
      and young ascanius justly may complain
      of his defrauded and destind reign
      evn now the herald of the gods appeard
      waking i saw him and his message heard
      from jove he came commissiond heavnly bright
      with radiant beams and manifest to sight
      
      these walls he enterd and those words expressd
      fair queen oppose not what the gods command
      forcd by my fate i leave your happy land

      thus while he spoke already she began
      with sparkling eyes to view the guilty man
      from head to foot surveyd his person oer
      nor longer these outrageous threats forebore
      false as thou art and more than false forsworn
      not sprung from noble blood nor goddessborn
      but hewn from hardend entrails of a rock
      and rough hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck
      why should i fawn what have i worse to fear
      did he once look or lent a listning ear
      sighd when i sobbd or shed one kindly tear
      all symptoms of a base ungrateful mind
      so foul that which is worse tis hard to find
      of mans injustice why should i complain
      the gods and jove himself behold in vain
      triumphant treason yet no thunder flies
      nor juno views my wrongs with equal eyes
      faithless is earth and faithless are the skies
      justice is fled and truth is now no more
      i savd the shipwreckd exile on my shore
      with needful food his hungry trojans fed
      i took the traitor to my throne and bed
      fool that i was tis little to repeat
      the rest i stord and riggd his ruind fleet
      i rave i rave a gods command he pleads
      and makes heavn accessary to his deeds
      now lycian lots and now the delian god
      now hermes is employd from joves abode
      to warn him hence as if the peaceful state
      of heavnly powrs were touchd with human fate
      but go thy flight no longer i detain
      go seek thy promisd kingdom thro the main
      yet if the heavns will hear my pious vow
      the faithless waves not half so false as thou
      or secret sands shall sepulchers afford
      to thy proud vessels and their perjurd lord
      then shalt thou call on injurd didos name
      dido shall come in a black sulphry flame
      when death has once dissolvd her mortal frame
      shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep
      her angry ghost arising from the deep
      shall haunt thee waking and disturb thy sleep
      at least my shade thy punishment shall know
      and fame shall spread the pleasing news below

      abruptly here she stops then turns away
      her loathing eyes and shuns the sight of day
      amazd he stood revolving in his mind
      what speech to frame and what excuse to find
      her fearful maids their fainting mistress led
      and softly laid her on her ivory bed

      but good aeneas tho he much desird
      to give that pity which her grief requird
      tho much he mournd and labourd with his love
      resolvd at length obeys the will of jove
      reviews his forces they with early care
      unmoor their vessels and for sea prepare
      the fleet is soon afloat in all its pride
      and wellcalkd galleys in the harbour ride
      then oaks for oars they felld or as they stood
      of its green arms despoild the growing wood
      studious of flight the beach is coverd oer
      with trojan bands that blacken all the shore
      on evry side are seen descending down
      thick swarms of soldiers loaden from the town
      thus in battalia march embodied ants
      fearful of winter and of future wants
      t invade the corn and to their cells convey
      the plunderd forage of their yellow prey
      the sable troops along the narrow tracks
      scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs
      some set their shoulders to the pondrous grain
      some guard the spoil some lash the lagging train
      all ply their sevral tasks and equal toil sustain

      what pangs the tender breast of dido tore
      when from the towr she saw the coverd shore
      and heard the shouts of sailors from afar
      mixd with the murmurs of the watry war
      allpowrful love what changes canst thou cause
      in human hearts subjected to thy laws
      once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends
      to prayrs and mean submissions she descends
      no female arts or aids she left untried
      nor counsels unexplord before she died
      look anna look the trojans crowd to sea
      they spread their canvas and their anchors weigh
      the shouting crew their ships with garlands bind
      invoke the sea gods and invite the wind
      could i have thought this threatning blow so near
      my tender soul had been forewarnd to bear
      but do not you my last request deny
      with yon perfidious man your intrest try
      and bring me news if i must live or die
      you are his favrite you alone can find
      the dark recesses of his inmost mind
      in all his trusted secrets you have part
      and know the soft approaches to his heart
      haste then and humbly seek my haughty foe
      tell him i did not with the grecians go
      nor did my fleet against his friends employ
      nor swore the ruin of unhappy troy
      nor movd with hands profane his fathers dust
      why should he then reject a suit so just
      whom does he shun and whither would he fly
      can he this last this only prayr deny
      let him at least his dangrous flight delay
      wait better winds and hope a calmer sea
      the nuptials he disclaims i urge no more
      let him pursue the promisd latian shore
      a short delay is all i ask him now
      a pause of grief an interval from woe
      till my soft soul be temperd to sustain
      accustomd sorrows and inurd to pain
      if you in pity grant this one request
      my death shall glut the hatred of his breast
      this mournful message pious anna bears
      and seconds with her own her sisters tears
      but all her arts are still employd in vain
      again she comes and is refusd again
      his hardend heart nor prayrs nor threatnings move
      fate and the god had stoppd his ears to love

      as when the winds their airy quarrel try
      justling from evry quarter of the sky
      this way and that the mountain oak they bend
      his boughs they shatter and his branches rend
      with leaves and falling mast they spread the ground
      the hollow valleys echo to the sound
      unmovd the royal plant their fury mocks
      or shaken clings more closely to the rocks
      far as he shoots his towring head on high
      so deep in earth his fixd foundations lie
      no less a storm the trojan hero bears
      thick messages and loud complaints he hears
      and bandied words still beating on his ears
      sighs groans and tears proclaim his inward pains
      but the firm purpose of his heart remains

      the wretched queen pursued by cruel fate
      begins at length the light of heavn to hate
      and loathes to live then dire portents she sees
      to hasten on the death her soul decrees
      strange to relate for when before the shrine
      she pours in sacrifice the purple wine
      the purple wine is turnd to putrid blood
      and the white offerd milk converts to mud
      this dire presage to her alone reveald
      from all and evn her sister she conceald
      a marble temple stood within the grove
      sacred to death and to her murderd love
      that honourd chapel she had hung around
      with snowy fleeces and with garlands crownd
      oft when she visited this lonely dome
      strange voices issued from her husbands tomb
      she thought she heard him summon her away
      invite her to his grave and chide her stay
      hourly tis heard when with a boding note
      the solitary screech owl strains her throat
      and on a chimneys top or turrets height
      with songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night
      besides old prophecies augment her fears
      and stern aeneas in her dreams appears
      disdainful as by day she seems alone
      to wander in her sleep thro ways unknown
      guideless and dark or in a desert plain
      to seek her subjects and to seek in vain
      like pentheus when distracted with his fear
      he saw two suns and double thebes appear
      or mad orestes when his mothers ghost
      full in his face infernal torches tossd
      and shook her snaky locks he shuns the sight
      flies oer the stage surprisd with mortal fright
      the furies guard the door and intercept his flight

      now sinking underneath a load of grief
      from death alone she seeks her last relief
      the time and means resolvd within her breast
      she to her mournful sister thus addressd
      
      rejoice she said instructed from above
      my lover i shall gain or lose my love
      nigh rising atlas next the falling sun
      long tracts of ethiopian climates run
      there a massylian priestess i have found
      honourd for age for magic arts renownd
      th hesperian temple was her trusted care
      twas she supplied the wakeful dragons fare
      she poppy seeds in honey taught to steep
      reclaimd his rage and soothd him into sleep
      she watchd the golden fruit her charms unbind
      the chains of love or fix them on the mind
      she stops the torrents leaves the channel dry
      repels the stars and backward bears the sky
      the yawning earth rebellows to her call
      pale ghosts ascend and mountain ashes fall
      witness ye gods and thou my better part
      how loth i am to try this impious art
      within the secret court with silent care
      erect a lofty pile exposd in air
      hang on the topmost part the trojan vest
      spoils arms and presents of my faithless guest
      next under these the bridal bed be placd
      where i my ruin in his arms embracd
      all relics of the wretch are doomd to fire
      for so the priestess and her charms require

      thus far she said and farther speech forbears
      a mortal paleness in her face appears
      yet the mistrustless anna could not find
      the secret funral in these rites designd
      nor thought so dire a rage possessd her mind
      unknowing of a train conceald so well
      she feard no worse than when sichaeus fell
      therefore obeys the fatal pile they rear
      within the secret court exposd in air
      the cloven holms and pines are heapd on high
      and garlands on the hollow spaces lie
      sad cypress vervain yew compose the wreath
      and evry baleful green denoting death
      the queen determind to the fatal deed
      the spoils and sword he left in order spread
      and the mans image on the nuptial bed

      and now 
      the priestess enters with her hair unbound
      and thrice invokes the powrs below the ground
      night erebus and chaos she proclaims
      and threefold hecate with her hundred names
      and three dianas next she sprinkles round
      with feignd avernian drops the hallowd ground
      culls hoary simples found by phoebes light
      with brazen sickles reapd at noon of night
      then mixes baleful juices in the bowl
      and cuts the forehead of a newborn foal
      robbing the mothers love the destind queen
      observes assisting at the rites obscene
      a leavend cake in her devoted hands
      she holds and next the highest altar stands
      one tender foot was shod her other bare
      girt was her gatherd gown and loose her hair
      thus dressd she summond with her dying breath
      the heavns and planets conscious of her death
      and evry powr if any rules above
      who minds or who revenges injurd love

      twas dead of night when weary bodies close
      their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose
      the winds no longer whisper thro the woods
      nor murmring tides disturb the gentle floods
      the stars in silent order movd around
      and peace with downy wings was brooding on the ground
      the flocks and herds and partycolourd fowl
      which haunt the woods or swim the weedy pool
      stretchd on the quiet earth securely lay
      forgetting the past labours of the day
      all else of natures common gift partake
      unhappy dido was alone awake
      nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find
      sleep fled her eyes as quiet fled her mind
      despair and rage and love divide her heart
      despair and rage had some but love the greater part

      then thus she said within her secret mind
      what shall i do what succour can i find
      become a suppliant to hyarbas pride
      and take my turn to court and be denied
      shall i with this ungrateful trojan go
      forsake an empire and attend a foe
      himself i refugd and his train relievd
      tis true but am i sure to be receivd
      can gratitude in trojan souls have place
      laomedon still lives in all his race
      then shall i seek alone the churlish crew
      or with my fleet their flying sails pursue
      what force have i but those whom scarce before
      i drew reluctant from their native shore
      will they again embark at my desire
      once more sustain the seas and quit their second tyre
      rather with steel thy guilty breast invade
      and take the fortune thou thyself hast made
      your pity sister first seducd my mind
      or seconded too well what i designd
      these dearbought pleasures had i never known
      had i continued free and still my own
      avoiding love i had not found despair
      but shard with salvage beasts the common air
      like them a lonely life i might have led
      not mournd the living nor disturbd the dead
      these thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast
      on board the trojan found more easy rest
      resolvd to sail in sleep he passd the night
      and orderd all things for his early flight

      to whom once more the winged god appears
      his former youthful mien and shape he wears
      and with this new alarm invades his ears
      sleepst thou o goddessborn and canst thou drown
      thy needful cares so near a hostile town
      beset with foes nor hearst the western gales
      invite thy passage and inspire thy sails
      she harbours in her heart a furious hate
      and thou shalt find the dire effects too late
      fixd on revenge and obstinate to die
      haste swiftly hence while thou hast powr to fly
      the sea with ships will soon be coverd oer
      and blazing firebrands kindle all the shore
      prevent her rage while night obscures the skies
      and sail before the purple morn arise
      who knows what hazards thy delay may bring
      womans a various and a changeful thing
      thus hermes in the dream then took his flight
      aloft in air unseen and mixd with night

      twice warnd by the celestial messenger
      the pious prince arose with hasty fear
      then rousd his drowsy train without delay
      haste to your banks your crooked anchors weigh
      and spread your flying sails and stand to sea
      a god commands he stood before my sight
      and urgd us once again to speedy flight
      o sacred powr what powr soeer thou art
      to thy blest orders i resign my heart
      lead thou the way protect thy trojan bands
      and prosper the design thy will commands
      he said and drawing forth his flaming sword
      his thundring arm divides the manytwisted cord
      an emulating zeal inspires his train
      they run they snatch they rush into the main
      with headlong haste they leave the desert shores
      and brush the liquid seas with labring oars

      aurora now had left her saffron bed
      and beams of early light the heavns oerspread
      when from a towr the queen with wakeful eyes
      saw day point upward from the rosy skies
      she lookd to seaward but the sea was void
      and scarce in ken the sailing ships descried
      stung with despite and furious with despair
      she struck her trembling breast and tore her hair
      and shall th ungrateful traitor go she said
      my land forsaken and my love betrayd
      shall we not arm not rush from evry street
      to follow sink and burn his perjurd fleet
      haste haul my galleys out pursue the foe
      bring flaming brands set sail and swiftly row
      what have i said where am i fury turns
      my brain and my distemperd bosom burns
      then when i gave my person and my throne
      this hate this rage had been more timely shown
      see now the promisd faith the vaunted name
      the pious man who rushing thro the flame
      preservd his gods and to the phrygian shore
      the burthen of his feeble father bore
      i should have torn him piecemeal strowd in floods
      his scatterd limbs or left exposd in woods
      destroyd his friends and son and from the fire
      have set the reeking boy before the sire
      events are doubtful which on battles wait
      yet wheres the doubt to souls secure of fate
      my tyrians at their injurd queens command
      had tossd their fires amid the trojan band
      at once extinguishd all the faithless name
      and i myself in vengeance of my shame
      had falln upon the pile to mend the funral flame
      thou sun who viewst at once the world below
      thou juno guardian of the nuptial vow
      thou hecate hearken from thy dark abodes
      ye furies fiends and violated gods
      all powrs invokd with didos dying breath
      attend her curses and avenge her death
      if so the fates ordain jove commands
      th ungrateful wretch should find the latian lands
      yet let a race untamd and haughty foes
      his peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose
      oppressd with numbers in th unequal field
      his men discouragd and himself expelld
      let him for succour sue from place to place
      torn from his subjects and his sons embrace
      first let him see his friends in battle slain
      and their untimely fate lament in vain
      and when at length the cruel war shall cease
      on hard conditions may he buy his peace
      nor let him then enjoy supreme command
      but fall untimely by some hostile hand
      and lie unburied on the barren sand
      these are my prayrs and this my dying will
      and you my tyrians evry curse fulfil
      perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim
      against the prince the people and the name
      these grateful offrings on my grave bestow
      nor league nor love the hostile nations know
      now and from hence in evry future age
      when rage excites your arms and strength supplies the rage
      rise some avenger of our libyan blood
      with fire and sword pursue the perjurd brood
      our arms our seas our shores opposd to theirs
      and the same hate descend on all our heirs

      this said within her anxious mind she weighs
      the means of cutting short her odious days
      then to sichaeus nurse she briefly said
      
      go barce call my sister let her care
      the solemn rites of sacrifice prepare
      the sheep and all th atoning offrings bring
      sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
      with living drops then let her come and thou
      with sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow
      thus will i pay my vows to stygian jove
      and end the cares of my disastrous love
      then cast the trojan image on the fire
      and as that burns my passions shall expire

      the nurse moves onward with officious care
      and all the speed her aged limbs can bear
      but furious dido with dark thoughts involvd
      shook at the mighty mischief she resolvd
      with livid spots distinguishd was her face
      red were her rolling eyes and discomposd her pace
      ghastly she gazd with pain she drew her breath
      and nature shiverd at approaching death

      then swiftly to the fatal place she passd
      and mounts the funral pile with furious haste
      unsheathes the sword the trojan left behind
      
      but when she viewd the garments loosely spread
      which once he wore and saw the conscious bed
      she pausd and with a sigh the robes embracd
      then on the couch her trembling body cast
      repressd the ready tears and spoke her last
      dear pledges of my love while heavn so pleasd
      receive a soul of mortal anguish easd
      my fatal course is finishd and i go
      a glorious name among the ghosts below
      a lofty city by my hands is raisd
      pygmalion punishd and my lord appeasd
      what could my fortune have afforded more
      had the false trojan never touchd my shore
      then kissd the couch and must i die she said
      and unrevengd tis doubly to be dead
      yet evn this death with pleasure i receive
      on any terms tis better than to live
      these flames from far may the false trojan view
      these boding omens his base flight pursue

      she said and struck deep enterd in her side
      the piercing steel with reeking purple dyed
      cloggd in the wound the cruel weapon stands
      the spouting blood came streaming on her hands
      her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke
      and with loud cries the sounding palace shook
      distracted from the fatal sight they fled
      and thro the town the dismal rumour spread
      first from the frighted court the yell began
      redoubled thence from house to house it ran
      the groans of men with shrieks laments and cries
      of mixing women mount the vaulted skies
      not less the clamour than if ancient tyre
      or the new carthage set by foes on fire
      the rolling ruin with their lovd abodes
      involvd the blazing temples of their gods

      her sister hears and furious with despair
      she beats her breast and rends her yellow hair
      and calling on elizas name aloud
      runs breathless to the place and breaks the crowd
      was all that pomp of woe for this prepard
      these fires this funral pile these altars reard
      was all this train of plots contrivd said she
      all only to deceive unhappy me
      which is the worst didst thou in death pretend
      to scorn thy sister or delude thy friend
      thy summond sister and thy friend had come
      one sword had servd us both one common tomb
      was i to raise the pile the powrs invoke
      not to be present at the fatal stroke
      at once thou hast destroyd thyself and me
      thy town thy senate and thy colony
      bring water bathe the wound while i in death
      lay close my lips to hers and catch the flying breath
      this said she mounts the pile with eager haste
      and in her arms the gasping queen embracd
      her temples chafd and her own garments tore
      to stanch the streaming blood and cleanse the gore
      thrice dido tried to raise her drooping head
      and fainting thrice fell grovling on the bed
      thrice opd her heavy eyes and sought the light
      but having found it sickend at the sight
      and closd her lids at last in endless night

      then juno grieving that she should sustain
      a death so lingring and so full of pain
      sent iris down to free her from the strife
      of labring nature and dissolve her life
      for since she died not doomd by heavns decree
      or her own crime but human casualty
      and rage of love that plungd her in despair
      the sisters had not cut the topmost hair
      which proserpine and they can only know
      nor made her sacred to the shades below
      downward the various goddess took her flight
      and drew a thousand colours from the light
      then stood above the dying lovers head
      and said i thus devote thee to the dead
      this offring to th infernal gods i bear
      thus while she spoke she cut the fatal hair
      the struggling soul was loosd and life dissolvd in air



 


      meantime the trojan cuts his watry way
      fixd on his voyage thro the curling sea
      then casting back his eyes with dire amaze
      sees on the punic shore the mounting blaze
      the cause unknown yet his presaging mind
      the fate of dido from the fire divind
      he knew the stormy souls of womankind
      what secret springs their eager passions move
      how capable of death for injurd love
      dire auguries from hence the trojans draw
      till neither fires nor shining shores they saw
      now seas and skies their prospect only bound
      an empty space above a floating field around
      but soon the heavns with shadows were oerspread
      a swelling cloud hung hovring oer their head
      livid it lookd the threatning of a storm
      then night and horror oceans face deform
      the pilot palinurus cried aloud
      what gusts of weather from that gathring cloud
      my thoughts presage ere yet the tempest roars
      stand to your tackle mates and stretch your oars
      contract your swelling sails and luff to wind
      the frighted crew perform the task assignd
      then to his fearless chief not heavn said he
      tho jove himself should promise italy
      can stem the torrent of this raging sea
      mark how the shifting winds from west arise
      and what collected night involves the skies
      nor can our shaken vessels live at sea
      much less against the tempest force their way
      tis fate diverts our course and fate we must obey
      not far from hence if i observd aright
      the southing of the stars and polar light
      sicilia lies whose hospitable shores
      in safety we may reach with struggling oars
      aeneas then replied too sure i find
      we strive in vain against the seas and wind
      now shift your sails what place can please me more
      than what you promise the sicilian shore
      whose hallowd earth anchises bones contains
      and where a prince of trojan lineage reigns
      the course resolvd before the western wind
      they scud amain and make the port assignd
      meantime acestes from a lofty stand
      beheld the fleet descending on the land
      and not unmindful of his ancient race
      down from the cliff he ran with eager pace
      and held the hero in a strict embrace
      of a rough libyan bear the spoils he wore
      and either hand a pointed javlin bore
      his mother was a dame of dardan blood
      his sire crinisus a sicilian flood
      he welcomes his returning friends ashore
      with plenteous country cates and homely store

      now when the following morn had chasd away
      the flying stars and light restord the day
      aeneas calld the trojan troops around
      and thus bespoke them from a rising ground
      offspring of heavn divine dardanian race
      the sun revolving thro th ethereal space
      the shining circle of the year has filld
      since first this isle my fathers ashes held
      and now the rising day renews the year
      a day for ever sad for ever dear
      this would i celebrate with annual games
      with gifts on altars pild and holy flames
      tho banishd to gaetulias barren sands
      caught on the grecian seas or hostile lands
      but since this happy storm our fleet has drivn
      
      upon these friendly shores and flowry plains
      which hide anchises and his blest remains
      let us with joy perform his honours due
      and pray for prosprous winds our voyage to renew
      pray that in towns and temples of our own
      the name of great anchises may be known
      and yearly games may spread the gods renown
      our sports acestes of the trojan race
      with royal gifts ordaind is pleasd to grace
      two steers on evry ship the king bestows
      his gods and ours shall share your equal vows
      besides if nine days hence the rosy morn
      shall with unclouded light the skies adorn
      that day with solemn sports i mean to grace
      light galleys on the seas shall run a watry race
      some shall in swiftness for the goal contend
      and others try the twanging bow to bend
      the strong with iron gauntlets armd shall stand
      opposd in combat on the yellow sand
      let all be present at the games prepard
      and joyful victors wait the just reward
      but now assist the rites with garlands crownd
      he said and first his brows with myrtle bound
      then helymus by his example led
      and old acestes each adornd his head
      thus young ascanius with a sprightly grace
      his temples tied and all the trojan race

      aeneas then advancd amidst the train
      by thousands followd thro the flowry plain
      to great anchises tomb which when he found
      he pourd to bacchus on the hallowd ground
      two bowls of sparkling wine of milk two more
      and two from offerd bulls of purple gore
      with roses then the sepulcher he strowd
      and thus his fathers ghost bespoke aloud
      hail o ye holy manes hail again
      paternal ashes now reviewd in vain
      the gods permitted not that you with me
      should reach the promisd shores of italy
      or tibers flood what flood soeer it be
      scarce had he finishd when with speckled pride
      a serpent from the tomb began to glide
      his hugy bulk on sevn high volumes rolld
      blue was his breadth of back but streakd with scaly gold
      thus riding on his curls he seemd to pass
      a rolling fire along and singe the grass
      more various colours thro his body run
      than iris when her bow imbibes the sun
      betwixt the rising altars and around
      the sacred monster shot along the ground
      with harmless play amidst the bowls he passd
      and with his lolling tongue assayd the taste
      thus fed with holy food the wondrous guest
      within the hollow tomb retird to rest
      the pious prince surprisd at what he viewd
      the funral honours with more zeal renewd
      doubtful if this places genius were
      or guardian of his fathers sepulcher
      five sheep according to the rites he slew
      as many swine and steers of sable hue
      new genrous wine he from the goblets pourd
      and calld his fathers ghost from hell restord
      the glad attendants in long order come
      offring their gifts at great anchises tomb
      some add more oxen some divide the spoil
      some place the chargers on the grassy soil
      some blow the fires and offered entrails broil

      now came the day desird the skies were bright
      with rosy luster of the rising light
      the bordring people rousd by sounding fame
      of trojan feasts and great acestes name
      the crowded shore with acclamations fill
      part to behold and part to prove their skill
      and first the gifts in public view they place
      green laurel wreaths and palm the victors grace
      within the circle arms and tripods lie
      ingots of gold and silver heapd on high
      and vests embroiderd of the tyrian dye
      the trumpets clangour then the feast proclaims
      and all prepare for their appointed games
      four galleys first which equal rowers bear
      advancing in the watry lists appear
      the speedy dolphin that outstrips the wind
      bore mnestheus author of the memmian kind
      gyas the vast chimaeras bulk commands
      which rising like a towring city stands
      three trojans tug at evry labring oar
      three banks in three degrees the sailors bore
      beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar
      sergesthus who began the sergian race
      in the great centaur took the leading place
      cloanthus on the seagreen scylla stood
      from whom cluentius draws his trojan blood

      far in the sea against the foaming shore
      there stands a rock the raging billows roar
      above his head in storms but when tis clear
      uncurl their ridgy backs and at his foot appear
      in peace below the gentle waters run
      the cormorants above lie basking in the sun
      on this the hero fixd an oak in sight
      the mark to guide the mariners aright
      to bear with this the seamen stretch their oars
      then round the rock they steer and seek the former shores
      the lots decide their place above the rest
      each leader shining in his tyrian vest
      the common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs
      their temples crown and shade their sweaty brows
      besmeard with oil their naked shoulders shine
      all take their seats and wait the sounding sign
      they gripe their oars and evry panting breast
      is raisd by turns with hope by turns with fear depressd
      the clangour of the trumpet gives the sign
      at once they start advancing in a line
      with shouts the sailors rend the starry skies
      lashd with their oars the smoky billows rise
      sparkles the briny main and the vexd ocean fries
      exact in time with equal strokes they row
      at once the brushing oars and brazen prow
      dash up the sandy waves and ope the depths below
      not fiery coursers in a chariot race
      invade the field with half so swift a pace
      not the fierce driver with more fury lends
      the sounding lash and ere the stroke descends
      low to the wheels his pliant body bends
      the partial crowd their hopes and fears divide
      and aid with eager shouts the favourd side
      cries murmurs clamours with a mixing sound
      from woods to woods from hills to hills rebound

      amidst the loud applauses of the shore
      gyas outstrippd the rest and sprung before
      cloanthus better mannd pursued him fast
      but his oermasted galley checkd his haste
      the centaur and the dolphin brush the brine
      with equal oars advancing in a line
      and now the mighty centaur seems to lead
      and now the speedy dolphin gets ahead
      now board to board the rival vessels row
      the billows lave the skies and ocean groans below
      they reachd the mark proud gyas and his train
      in triumph rode the victors of the main
      but steering round he chargd his pilot stand
      more close to shore and skim along the sand
      let others bear to sea menoetes heard
      but secret shelves too cautiously he feard
      and fearing sought the deep and still aloof he steerd
      with louder cries the captain calld again
      bear to the rocky shore and shun the main
      he spoke and speaking at his stern he saw
      the bold cloanthus near the shelvings draw
      betwixt the mark and him the scylla stood
      and in a closer compass plowd the flood
      he passd the mark and wheeling got before
      gyas blasphemd the gods devoutly swore
      cried out for anger and his hair he tore
      mindless of others lives  and careless of his own
      the trembling dotard to the deck he drew
      then hoisted up and overboard he threw
      this done he seizd the helm his fellows cheerd
      turnd short upon the shelfs and madly steerd

      hardly his head the plunging pilot rears
      cloggd with his clothes and cumberd with his years
      now dropping wet he climbs the cliff with pain
      the crowd that saw him fall and float again
      shout from the distant shore and loudly laughd
      to see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught
      the following centaur and the dolphins crew
      their vanishd hopes of victory renew
      while gyas lags they kindle in the race
      to reach the mark sergesthus takes the place
      mnestheus pursues and while around they wind
      comes up not half his galleys length behind
      then on the deck amidst his mates appeard
      and thus their drooping courages he cheerd
      my friends and hectors followers heretofore
      exert your vigour tug the labring oar
      stretch to your strokes my still unconquerd crew
      whom from the flaming walls of troy i drew
      in this our common intrest let me find
      that strength of hand that courage of the mind
      as when you stemmd the strong malean flood
      and oer the syrtes broken billows rowd
      i seek not now the foremost palm to gain
      tho yetbut ah that haughty wish is vain
      let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain
      but to be last the lags of all the race
      redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace
      now one and all they tug amain they row
      at the full stretch and shake the brazen prow
      the sea beneath em sinks their labring sides
      are swelld and sweat runs guttring down in tides
      chance aids their daring with unhopd success
      sergesthus eager with his beak to press
      betwixt the rival galley and the rock
      shuts up th unwieldly centaur in the lock
      the vessel struck and with the dreadful shock
      her oars she shiverd and her head she broke
      the trembling rowers from their banks arise
      and anxious for themselves renounce the prize
      with iron poles they heave her off the shores
      and gather from the sea their floating oars
      the crew of mnestheus with elated minds
      urge their success and call the willing winds
      then ply their oars and cut their liquid way
      in larger compass on the roomy sea
      as when the dove her rocky hold forsakes
      rousd in a fright her sounding wings she shakes
      the cavern rings with clattring out she flies
      and leaves her callow care and cleaves the skies
      at first she flutters but at length she springs
      to smoother flight and shoots upon her wings
      so mnestheus in the dolphin cuts the sea
      and flying with a force that force assists his way
      sergesthus in the centaur soon he passd
      wedgd in the rocky shoals and sticking fast
      in vain the victor he with cries implores
      and practices to row with shatterd oars
      then mnestheus bears with gyas and outflies
      the ship without a pilot yields the prize
      unvanquishd scylla now alone remains
      her he pursues and all his vigour strains
      shouts from the favring multitude arise
      applauding echo to the shouts replies
      shouts wishes and applause run rattling thro the skies
      these clamours with disdain the scylla heard
      much grudgd the praise but more the robbd reward
      resolvd to hold their own they mend their pace
      all obstinate to die or gain the race
      raisd with success the dolphin swiftly ran
      for they can conquer who believe they can
      both urge their oars and fortune both supplies
      and both perhaps had shard an equal prize
      when to the seas cloanthus holds his hands
      and succour from the watry powrs demands
      gods of the liquid realms on which i row
      if givn by you the laurel bind my brow
      assist to make me guilty of my vow
      a snowwhite bull shall on your shore be slain
      his offerd entrails cast into the main
      and ruddy wine from golden goblets thrown
      your grateful gift and my return shall own
      the choir of nymphs and phorcus from below
      with virgin panopea heard his vow
      and old portunus with his breadth of hand
      pushd on and sped the galley to the land
      swift as a shaft or winged wind she flies
      and darting to the port obtains the prize

      the herald summons all and then proclaims
      cloanthus conquror of the naval games
      the prince with laurel crowns the victors head
      and three fat steers are to his vessel led
      the ships reward with genrous wine beside
      and sums of silver which the crew divide
      the leaders are distinguishd from the rest
      the victor honourd with a nobler vest
      where gold and purple strive in equal rows
      and needlework its happy cost bestows
      there ganymede is wrought with living art
      chasing thro idas groves the trembling hart
      breathless he seems yet eager to pursue
      when from aloft descends in open view
      the bird of jove and sousing on his prey
      with crooked talons bears the boy away
      in vain with lifted hands and gazing eyes
      his guards behold him soaring thro the skies
      and dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries

      mnestheus the second victor was declard
      and summond there the second prize he shard
      a coat of mail brave demoleus bore
      more brave aeneas from his shoulders tore
      in single combat on the trojan shore
      this was ordaind for mnestheus to possess
      in war for his defence for ornament in peace
      rich was the gift and glorious to behold
      but yet so pondrous with its plates of gold
      that scarce two servants could the weight sustain
      yet loaded thus demoleus oer the plain
      pursued and lightly seizd the trojan train
      the third succeeding to the last reward
      two goodly bowls of massy silver shard
      with figures prominent and richly wrought
      and two brass caldrons from dodona brought

      thus all rewarded by the heros hands
      their conquring temples bound with purple bands
      and now sergesthus clearing from the rock
      brought back his galley shatterd with the shock
      forlorn she lookd without an aiding oar
      and houted by the vulgar made to shore
      as when a snake surprisd upon the road
      is crushd athwart her body by the load
      of heavy wheels or with a mortal wound
      her belly bruisd and trodden to the ground
      in vain with loosend curls she crawls along
      yet fierce above she brandishes her tongue
      glares with her eyes and bristles with her scales
      but groveling in the dust her parts unsound she trails
      so slowly to the port the centaur tends
      but what she wants in oars with sails amends
      yet for his galley savd the grateful prince
      is pleasd th unhappy chief to recompense
      pholoe the cretan slave rewards his care
      beauteous herself with lovely twins as fair

      from thence his way the trojan hero bent
      into the neighbring plain with mountains pent
      whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood
      full in the midst of this fair valley stood
      a native theatre which rising slow
      by just degrees oerlookd the ground below
      high on a sylvan throne the leader sate
      a numrous train attend in solemn state
      here those that in the rapid course delight
      desire of honour and the prize invite
      the rival runners without order stand
      the trojans mixd with the sicilian band
      first nisus with euryalus appears
      euryalus a boy of blooming years
      with sprightly grace and equal beauty crownd
      nisus for friendship to the youth renownd
      diores next of priams royal race
      then salius joined with patron took their place
      but patron in arcadia had his birth
      and salius his from arcananian earth
      then two sicilian youths the names of these
      swift helymus and lovely panopes
      both jolly huntsmen both in forest bred
      and owning old acestes for their head
      with sevral others of ignobler name
      whom time has not deliverd oer to fame

      to these the hero thus his thoughts explaind
      in words which genral approbation gaind
      one common largess is for all designd
      the vanquishd and the victor shall be joind
      two darts of polishd steel and gnosian wood
      a silverstudded ax alike bestowd
      the foremost three have olive wreaths decreed
      the first of these obtains a stately steed
      adornd with trappings and the next in fame
      the quiver of an amazonian dame
      with featherd thracian arrows well supplied
      a golden belt shall gird his manly side
      which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied
      the third this grecian helmet shall content
      he said to their appointed base they went
      with beating hearts th expected sign receive
      and starting all at once the barrier leave
      spread out as on the winged winds they flew
      and seizd the distant goal with greedy view
      shot from the crowd swift nisus all oerpassd
      nor storms nor thunder equal half his haste
      the next but tho the next yet far disjoind
      came salius and euryalus behind
      then helymus whom young diores plied
      step after step and almost side by side
      his shoulders pressing and in longer space
      had won or left at least a dubious race

      now spent the goal they almost reach at last
      when eager nisus hapless in his haste
      slippd first and slipping fell upon the plain
      soakd with the blood of oxen newly slain
      the careless victor had not markd his way
      but treading where the treachrous puddle lay
      his heels flew up and on the grassy floor
      he fell besmeard with filth and holy gore
      not mindless then euryalus of thee
      nor of the sacred bonds of amity
      he strove th immediate rivals hope to cross
      and caught the foot of salius as he rose
      so salius lay extended on the plain
      euryalus springs out the prize to gain
      and leaves the crowd applauding peals attend
      the victor to the goal who vanquishd by his friend
      next helymus and then diores came
      by two misfortunes made the third in fame

      but salius enters and exclaiming loud
      for justice deafens and disturbs the crowd
      urges his cause may in the court be heard
      and pleads the prize is wrongfully conferrd
      but favour for euryalus appears
      his blooming beauty with his tender tears
      had bribd the judges for the promisd prize
      besides diores fills the court with cries
      who vainly reaches at the last reward
      if the first palm on salius be conferrd
      then thus the prince let no disputes arise
      where fortune placd it i award the prize
      but fortunes errors give me leave to mend
      at least to pity my deserving friend
      he said and from among the spoils he draws
      
      a lions hide to salius this he gives
      nisus with envy sees the gift and grieves
      if such rewards to vanquishd men are due
      he said and falling is to rise by you
      what prize may nisus from your bounty claim
      who merited the first rewards and fame
      in falling both an equal fortune tried
      would fortune for my fall so well provide
      with this he pointed to his face and showd
      his hand and all his habit smeard with blood
      th indulgent father of the people smild
      and causd to be producd an ample shield
      of wondrous art by didymaon wrought
      long since from neptunes bars in triumph brought
      this givn to nisus he divides the rest
      and equal justice in his gifts expressd

      the race thus ended and rewards bestowd
      once more the prince bespeaks th attentive crowd
      if there be here whose dauntless courage dare
      in gauntlet fight with limbs and body bare
      his opposite sustain in open view
      stand forth the champion and the games renew
      two prizes i propose and thus divide
      a bull with gilded horns and fillets tied
      shall be the portion of the conquring chief
      a sword and helm shall cheer the losers grief

      then haughty dares in the lists appears
      stalking he strides his head erected bears
      his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield
      and loud applauses echo thro the field
      dares alone in combat usd to stand
      the match of mighty paris hand to hand
      the same at hectors funrals undertook
      gigantic butes of th amycian stock
      and by the stroke of his resistless hand
      stretchd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand
      such dares was and such he strode along
      and drew the wonder of the gazing throng
      his brawny back and ample breast he shows
      his lifted arms around his head he throws
      and deals in whistling air his empty blows
      his match is sought but thro the trembling band
      not one dares answer to the proud demand
      presuming of his force with sparkling eyes
      already he devours the promisd prize
      he claims the bull with awless insolence
      and having seizd his horns accosts the prince
      if none my matchless valour dares oppose
      how long shall dares wait his dastard foes
      permit me chief permit without delay
      to lead this uncontended gift away
      the crowd assents and with redoubled cries
      for the proud challenger demands the prize

      acestes fird with just disdain to see
      the palm usurpd without a victory
      reproachd entellus thus who sate beside
      and heard and saw unmovd the trojans pride
      once but in vain a champion of renown
      so tamely can you bear the ravishd crown
      a prize in triumph borne before your sight
      and shun for fear the danger of the fight
      where is our eryx now the boasted name
      the god who taught your thundring arm the game
      where now your baffled honour where the spoil
      that filld your house and fame that filld our isle
      entellus thus my soul is still the same
      unmovd with fear and movd with martial fame
      but my chill blood is curdled in my veins
      and scarce the shadow of a man remains
      o could i turn to that fair prime again
      that prime of which this boaster is so vain
      the brave who this decrepid age defies
      should feel my force without the promisd prize

      he said and rising at the word he threw
      two pondrous gauntlets down in open view
      gauntlets which eryx wont in fight to wield
      and sheathe his hands with in the listed field
      with fear and wonder seizd the crowd beholds
      the gloves of death with sevn distinguishd folds
      of tough bull hides the space within is spread
      with iron or with loads of heavy lead
      dares himself was daunted at the sight
      renouncd his challenge and refusd to fight
      astonishd at their weight the hero stands
      and poisd the pondrous engines in his hands
      what had your wonder said entellus been
      had you the gauntlets of alcides seen
      or viewd the stern debate on this unhappy green
      these which i bear your brother eryx bore
      still markd with batterd brains and mingled gore
      with these he long sustaind th herculean arm
      and these i wielded while my blood was warm
      this languishd frame while better spirits fed
      ere age unstrung my nerves or time oersnowd my head
      but if the challenger these arms refuse
      and cannot wield their weight or dare not use
      if great aeneas and acestes join
      in his request these gauntlets i resign
      let us with equal arms perform the fight
      and let him leave to fear since i resign my right

      this said entellus for the strife prepares
      strippd of his quilted coat his body bares
      composd of mighty bones and brawn he stands
      a goodly towring object on the sands
      then just aeneas equal arms supplied
      which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied
      both on the tiptoe stand at full extent
      their arms aloft their bodies inly bent
      their heads from aiming blows they bear afar
      with clashing gauntlets then provoke the war
      one on his youth and pliant limbs relies
      one on his sinews and his giant size
      the last is stiff with age his motion slow
      he heaves for breath he staggers to and fro
      and clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow
      yet equal in success they ward they strike
      their ways are diffrent but their art alike
      before behind the blows are dealt around
      their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound
      a storm of strokes well meant with fury flies
      and errs about their temples ears and eyes
      nor always errs for oft the gauntlet draws
      a sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws
      heavy with age entellus stands his ground
      but with his warping body wards the wound
      his hand and watchful eye keep even pace
      while dares traverses and shifts his place
      and like a captain who beleaguers round
      some strongbuilt castle on a rising ground
      views all th approaches with observing eyes
      this and that other part in vain he tries
      and more on industry than force relies
      with hands on high entellus threats the foe
      but dares watchd the motion from below
      and slippd aside and shunnd the long descending blow
      entellus wastes his forces on the wind
      and thus deluded of the stroke designd
      headlong and heavy fell his ample breast
      and weighty limbs his ancient mother pressd
      so falls a hollow pine that long had stood
      on idas height or erymanthus wood
      torn from the roots the diffring nations rise
      and shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies
      acestus runs with eager haste to raise
      the falln companion of his youthful days
      dauntless he rose and to the fight returnd
      with shame his glowing cheeks his eyes with fury burnd
      disdain and conscious virtue fird his breast
      and with redoubled force his foe he pressd
      he lays on load with either hand amain
      and headlong drives the trojan oer the plain
      nor stops nor stays nor rest nor breath allows
      but storms of strokes descend about his brows
      a rattling tempest and a hail of blows
      but now the prince who saw the wild increase
      of wounds commands the combatants to cease
      and bounds entellus wrath and bids the peace
      first to the trojan spent with toil he came
      and soothd his sorrow for the sufferd shame
      what fury seizd my friend the gods said he
      to him propitious and averse to thee
      have givn his arm superior force to thine
      tis madness to contend with strength divine
      the gauntlet fight thus ended from the shore
      his faithful friends unhappy dares bore
      his mouth and nostrils pourd a purple flood
      and pounded teeth came rushing with his blood
      faintly he staggerd thro the hissing throng
      and hung his head and traild his legs along
      the sword and casque are carried by his train
      but with his foe the palm and ox remain

      the champion then before aeneas came
      proud of his prize but prouder of his fame
      o goddessborn and you dardanian host
      mark with attention and forgive my boast
      learn what i was by what remains and know
      from what impending fate you savd my foe
      sternly he spoke and then confronts the bull
      and on his ample forehead aiming full
      the deadly stroke descending piercd the skull
      down drops the beast nor needs a second wound
      but sprawls in pangs of death and spurns the ground
      then thus in dares stead i offer this
      eryx accept a nobler sacrifice
      take the last gift my witherd arms can yield
      thy gauntlets i resign and here renounce the field

      this done aeneas orders for the close
      the strife of archers with contending bows
      the mast sergesthus shatterd galley bore
      with his own hands he raises on the shore
      a fluttring dove upon the top they tie
      the living mark at which their arrows fly
      the rival archers in a line advance
      their turn of shooting to receive from chance
      a helmet holds their names the lots are drawn
      on the first scroll was read hippocoon
      the people shout upon the next was found
      young mnestheus late with naval honours crownd
      the third containd eurytions noble name
      thy brother pandarus and next in fame
      whom pallas urgd the treaty to confound
      and send among the greeks a featherd wound
      acestes in the bottom last remaind
      whom not his age from youthful sports restraind
      soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows
      and from the quiver each his arrow chose
      hippocoons was the first with forceful sway
      it flew and whizzing cut the liquid way
      fixd in the mast the featherd weapon stands
      the fearful pigeon flutters in her bands
      and the tree trembled and the shouting cries
      of the pleasd people rend the vaulted skies
      then mnestheus to the head his arrow drove
      with lifted eyes and took his aim above
      but made a glancing shot and missed the dove
      yet missd so narrow that he cut the cord
      which fastend by the foot the flitting bird
      the captive thus releasd away she flies
      and beats with clapping wings the yielding skies
      his bow already bent eurytion stood
      and having first invokd his brother god
      his winged shaft with eager haste he sped
      the fatal message reachd her as she fled
      she leaves her life aloft she strikes the ground
      and renders back the weapon in the wound
      acestes grudging at his lot remains
      without a prize to gratify his pains
      yet shooting upward sends his shaft to show
      an archers art and boast his twanging bow
      the featherd arrow gave a dire portent
      and latter augurs judge from this event
      chafd by the speed it fird and as it flew
      a trail of following flames ascending drew
      kindling they mount and mark the shiny way
      across the skies as falling meteors play
      and vanish into wind or in a blaze decay
      the trojans and sicilians wildly stare
      and trembling turn their wonder into prayr
      the dardan prince put on a smiling face
      and straind acestes with a close embrace
      then honring him with gifts above the rest
      turnd the bad omen nor his fears confessd
      the gods said he this miracle have wrought
      and orderd you the prize without the lot
      accept this goblet rough with figurd gold
      which thracian cisseus gave my sire of old
      this pledge of ancient amity receive
      which to my second sire i justly give
      he said and with the trumpets cheerful sound
      proclaimd him victor and with laurelcrownd
      nor good eurytion envied him the prize
      tho he transfixd the pigeon in the skies
      who cut the line with second gifts was gracd
      the third was his whose arrow piercd the mast

      the chief before the games were wholly done
      calld periphantes tutor to his son
      and whisperd thus with speed ascanius find
      and if his childish troop be ready joind
      on horseback let him grace his grandsires day
      and lead his equals armd in just array
      he said and calling out the cirque he clears
      the crowd withdrawn an open plain appears
      and now the noble youths of form divine
      advance before their fathers in a line
      the riders grace the steeds the steeds with glory shine

      thus marching on in military pride
      shouts of applause resound from side to side
      their casques adornd with laurel wreaths they wear
      each brandishing aloft a cornel spear
      some at their backs their gilded quivers bore
      their chains of burnishd gold hung down before
      three graceful troops they formd upon the green
      three graceful leaders at their head were seen
      twelve followd evry chief and left a space between
      the first young priam led a lovely boy
      whose grandsire was th unhappy king of troy
      his race in after times was known to fame
      new honours adding to the latian name
      and well the royal boy his thracian steed became
      white were the fetlocks of his feet before
      and on his front a snowy star he bore
      then beauteous atys with iulus bred
      of equal age the second squadron led
      the last in order but the first in place
      first in the lovely features of his face
      rode fair ascanius on a fiery steed
      queen didos gift and of the tyrian breed
      sure coursers for the rest the king ordains
      with golden bits adornd and purple reins

      the pleasd spectators peals of shouts renew
      and all the parents in the children view
      their make their motions and their sprightly grace
      and hopes and fears alternate in their face

      th unfledgd commanders and their martial train
      first make the circuit of the sandy plain
      around their sires and at th appointed sign
      drawn up in beauteous order form a line
      the second signal sounds the troop divides
      in three distinguishd parts with three distinguishd guides
      again they close and once again disjoin
      in troop to troop opposd and line to line
      they meet they wheel they throw their darts afar
      with harmless rage and welldissembled war
      then in a round the mingled bodies run
      flying they follow and pursuing shun
      broken they break and rallying they renew
      in other forms the military shew
      at last in order undiscernd they join
      and march together in a friendly line
      and as the cretan labyrinth of old
      with wandring ways and many a winding fold
      involvd the weary feet without redress
      in a round error which denied recess
      so fought the trojan boys in warlike play
      turnd and returnd and still a diffrent way
      thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
      in circles when they swim around the watry race
      this game these carousels ascanius taught
      and building alba to the latins brought
      shewd what he learnd the latin sires impart
      to their succeeding sons the graceful art
      from these imperial rome receivd the game
      which troy the youths the trojan troop they name

      thus far the sacred sports they celebrate
      but fortune soon resumd her ancient hate
      for while they pay the dead his annual dues
      those envied rites saturnian juno views
      and sends the goddess of the various bow
      to try new methods of revenge below
      supplies the winds to wing her airy way
      where in the port secure the navy lay
      swiftly fair iris down her arch descends
      and undiscernd her fatal voyage ends
      she saw the gathring crowd and gliding thence
      the desert shore and fleet without defence
      the trojan matrons on the sands alone
      with sighs and tears anchises death bemoan
      then turning to the sea their weeping eyes
      their pity to themselves renews their cries
      alas said one what oceans yet remain
      for us to sail what labours to sustain
      all take the word and with a genral groan
      implore the gods for peace and places of their own

      the goddess great in mischief views their pains
      and in a womans form her heavnly limbs restrains
      in face and shape old beroe she became
      doryclus wife a venerable dame
      once blest with riches and a mothers name
      thus changd amidst the crying crowd she ran
      mixd with the matrons and these words began
      o wretched we whom not the grecian powr
      nor flames destroyd in troys unhappy hour
      o wretched we reservd by cruel fate
      beyond the ruins of the sinking state
      now sevn revolving years are wholly run
      since this improsprous voyage we begun
      since tossd from shores to shores from lands to lands
      inhospitable rocks and barren sands
      wandring in exile thro the stormy sea
      we search in vain for flying italy
      now cast by fortune on this kindred land
      what should our rest and rising walls withstand
      or hinder here to fix our banishd band
      o country lost and gods redeemd in vain
      if still in endless exile we remain
      shall we no more the trojan walls renew
      or streams of some dissembled simois view
      haste join with me th unhappy fleet consume
      cassandra bids and i declare her doom
      in sleep i saw her she supplied my hands
       with flaming brands
      with these said she these wandring ships destroy
      these are your fatal seats and this your troy
      time calls you now the precious hour employ
      slack not the good presage while heavn inspires
      our minds to dare and gives the ready fires
      see neptunes altars minister their brands
      the god is pleasd the god supplies our hands
      then from the pile a flaming fire she drew
      and tossd in air amidst the galleys threw

      wrappd in amaze the matrons wildly stare
      then pyrgo reverencd for her hoary hair
      pyrgo the nurse of priams numrous race
      no beroe this tho she belies her face
      what terrors from her frowning front arise
      behold a goddess in her ardent eyes
      what rays around her heavnly face are seen
      mark her majestic voice and more than mortal mien
      beroe but now i left whom pind with pain
      her age and anguish from these rites detain
      she said the matrons seizd with new amaze
      roll their malignant eyes and on the navy gaze
      they fear and hope and neither part obey
      they hope the fated land but fear the fatal way
      the goddess having done her task below
      mounts up on equal wings and bends her painted bow
      struck with the sight and seizd with rage divine
      the matrons prosecute their mad design
      they shriek aloud they snatch with impious hands
      the food of altars fires and flaming brands
      green boughs and saplings mingled in their haste
      and smoking torches on the ships they cast
      the flame unstoppd at first more fury gains
      and vulcan rides at large with loosend reins
      triumphant to the painted sterns he soars
      and seizes in this way the banks and crackling oars
      eumelus was the first the news to bear
      while yet they crowd the rural theatre
      then what they hear is witnessd by their eyes
      a storm of sparkles and of flames arise
      ascanius took th alarm while yet he led
      his early warriors on his prancing steed
      and spurring on his equals soon oerpassd
      nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste
      soon as the royal youth appeard in view
      he sent his voice before him as he flew
      what madness moves you matrons to destroy
      the last remainders of unhappy troy
      not hostile fleets but your own hopes you burn
      and on your friends your fatal fury turn
      behold your own ascanius while he said
      he drew his glittring helmet from his head
      in which the youths to sportful arms he led
      by this aeneas and his train appear
      and now the women seizd with shame and fear
      dispersd to woods and caverns take their flight
      abhor their actions and avoid the light
      their friends acknowledge and their error find
      and shake the goddess from their alterd mind

      not so the raging fires their fury cease
      but lurking in the seams with seeming peace
      work on their way amid the smouldring tow
      sure in destruction but in motion slow
      the silent plague thro the green timber eats
      and vomits out a tardy flame by fits
      down to the keels and upward to the sails
      the fire descends or mounts but still prevails
      nor buckets pourd nor strength of human hand
      can the victorious element withstand

      the pious hero rends his robe and throws
      to heavn his hands and with his hands his vows
      o jove he cried if prayrs can yet have place
      if thou abhorrst not all the dardan race
      if any spark of pity still remain
      if gods are gods and not invokd in vain
      yet spare the relics of the trojan train
      yet from the flames our burning vessels free
      or let thy fury fall alone on me
      at this devoted head thy thunder throw
      and send the willing sacrifice below

      scarce had he said when southern storms arise
      from pole to pole the forky lightning flies
      loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain
      heavn bellies downward and descends in rain
      whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent
      which hissing thro the planks the flames prevent
      and stop the fiery pest four ships alone
      burn to the waist and for the fleet atone

      but doubtful thoughts the heros heart divide
      if he should still in sicily reside
      forgetful of his fates or tempt the main
      in hope the promisd italy to gain
      then nautes old and wise to whom alone
      the will of heavn by pallas was foreshown
      versd in portents experiencd and inspird
      to tell events and what the fates requird
      thus while he stood to neither part inclind
      with cheerful words relievd his labring mind
      o goddessborn resignd in evry state
      with patience bear with prudence push your fate
      by suffring well our fortune we subdue
      fly when she frowns and when she calls pursue
      your friend acestes is of trojan kind
      to him disclose the secrets of your mind
      trust in his hands your old and useless train
      too numrous for the ships which yet remain
      the feeble old indulgent of their ease
      the dames who dread the dangers of the seas
      with all the dastard crew who dare not stand
      the shock of battle with your foes by land
      here you may build a common town for all
      and from acestes name acesta call
      the reasons with his friends experience joind
      encouragd much but more disturbd his mind

      twas dead of night when to his slumbring eyes
      his fathers shade descended from the skies
      and thus he spoke o more than vital breath
      lovd while i livd and dear evn after death
      o son in various toils and troubles tossd
      the king of heavn employs my careful ghost
      on his commands the god who savd from fire
      your flaming fleet and heard your just desire
      the wholesome counsel of your friend receive
      and here the coward train and woman leave
      the chosen youth and those who nobly dare
      transport to tempt the dangers of the war
      the stern italians will their courage try
      rough are their manners and their minds are high
      but first to plutos palace you shall go
      and seek my shade among the blest below
      for not with impious ghosts my soul remains
      nor suffers with the damnd perpetual pains
      but breathes the living air of soft elysian plains
      the chaste sibylla shall your steps convey
      and blood of offerd victims free the way
      there shall you know what realms the gods assign
      and learn the fates and fortunes of your line
      but now farewell i vanish with the night
      and feel the blast of heavns approaching light
      he said and mixd with shades and took his airy flight
      whither so fast the filial duty cried
      and why ah why the wishd embrace denied

      he said and rose as holy zeal inspires
      he rakes hot embers and renews the fires
      his country gods and vesta then adores
      with cakes and incense and their aid implores
      next for his friends and royal host he sent
      reveald his vision and the gods intent
      with his own purpose all without delay
      the will of jove and his desires obey
      they list with women each degenerate name
      who dares not hazard life for future fame
      these they cashier the brave remaining few
      oars banks and cables half consumd renew
      the prince designs a city with the plow
      the lots their sevral tenements allow
      this part is namd from ilium that from troy
      and the new king ascends the throne with joy
      a chosen senate from the people draws
      appoints the judges and ordains the laws
      then on the top of eryx they begin
      a rising temple to the paphian queen
      anchises last is honourd as a god
      a priest is added annual gifts bestowd
      and groves are planted round his blest abode
      nine days they pass in feasts their temples crownd
      and fumes of incense in the fanes abound
      then from the south arose a gentle breeze
      that curld the smoothness of the glassy seas
      the rising winds a ruffling gale afford
      and call the merry mariners aboard

      now loud laments along the shores resound
      of parting friends in close embraces bound
      the trembling women the degenerate train
      who shunnd the frightful dangers of the main
      evn those desire to sail and take their share
      of the rough passage and the promisd war
      whom good aeneas cheers and recommends
      to their new masters care his fearful friends
      on eryxs altars three fat calves he lays
      a lamb newfallen to the stormy seas
      then slips his haulsers and his anchors weighs
      high on the deck the godlike hero stands
      with olive crownd a charger in his hands
      then cast the reeking entrails in the brine
      and pourd the sacrifice of purple wine
      fresh gales arise with equal strokes they vie
      and brush the buxom seas and oer the billows fly

      meantime the mother goddess full of fears
      to neptune thus addressd with tender tears
      the pride of joves imperious queen the rage
      the malice which no suffrings can assuage
      compel me to these prayrs since neither fate
      nor time nor pity can remove her hate
      evn jove is thwarted by his haughty wife
      still vanquishd yet she still renews the strife
      as if twere little to consume the town
      which awd the world and wore th imperial crown
      she prosecutes the ghost of troy with pains
      and gnaws evn to the bones the last remains
      let her the causes of her hatred tell
      but you can witness its effects too well
      you saw the storm she raisd on libyan floods
      that mixd the mounting billows with the clouds
      when bribing aeolus she shook the main
      and movd rebellion in your watry reign
      with fury she possessd the dardan dames
      to burn their fleet with execrable flames
      and forcd aeneas when his ships were lost
      to leave his follwers on a foreign coast
      for what remains your godhead i implore
      and trust my son to your protecting powr
      if neither joves nor fates decree withstand
      secure his passage to the latian land

      then thus the mighty ruler of the main
      what may not venus hope from neptunes reign
      my kingdom claims your birth my late defence
      of your indangerd fleet may claim your confidence
      nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
      how much your lovd aeneas is my care
      thee xanthus and thee simois i attest
      your trojan troops when proud achilles pressd
      and drove before him headlong on the plain
      and dashd against the walls the trembling train
      when floods were filld with bodies of the slain
      when crimson xanthus doubtful of his way
      stood up on ridges to behold the sea
      new heaps came tumbling in and chokd his way
      when your aeneas fought but fought with odds
      of force unequal and unequal gods
      i spread a cloud before the victors sight
      sustaind the vanquishd and securd his flight
      evn then securd him when i sought with joy
      the vowd destruction of ungrateful troy
      my wills the same fair goddess fear no more
      your fleet shall safely gain the latian shore
      their lives are givn one destind head alone
      shall perish and for multitudes atone
      thus having armd with hopes her anxious mind
      his finny team saturnian neptune joind
      then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws
      and to the loosend reins permits the laws
      high on the waves his azure car he guides
      its axles thunder and the sea subsides
      and the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides
      the tempests fly before their fathers face
      trains of inferior gods his triumph grace
      and monster whales before their master play
      and choirs of tritons crowd the watry way
      the marshald powrs in equal troops divide
      to right and left the gods his better side
      inclose and on the worse the nymphs and nereids ride

      now smiling hope with sweet vicissitude
      within the heros mind his joys renewd
      he calls to raise the masts the sheets display
      the cheerful crew with diligence obey
      they scud before the wind and sail in open sea
      ahead of all the master pilot steers
      and as he leads the following navy veers
      the steeds of night had traveld half the sky
      the drowsy rowers on their benches lie
      when the soft god of sleep with easy flight
      descends and draws behind a trail of light
      thou palinurus art his destind prey
      to thee alone he takes his fatal way
      dire dreams to thee and iron sleep he bears
      and lighting on thy prow the form of phorbas wears
      then thus the traitor god began his tale
      the winds my friend inspire a pleasing gale
      the ships without thy care securely sail
      now steal an hour of sweet repose and i
      will take the rudder and thy room supply
      to whom the yawning pilot half asleep
      me dost thou bid to trust the treachrous deep
      the harlot smiles of her dissembling face
      and to her faith commit the trojan race
      shall i believe the siren south again
      and oft betrayd not know the monster main
      he said his fastend hands the rudder keep
      and fixd on heavn his eyes repel invading sleep
      the god was wroth and at his temples threw
      a branch in lethe dippd and drunk with stygian dew
      the pilot vanquishd by the powr divine
      soon closd his swimming eyes and lay supine
      scarce were his limbs extended at their length
      the god insulting with superior strength
      fell heavy on him plungd him in the sea
      and with the stern the rudder tore away
      headlong he fell and struggling in the main
      cried out for helping hands but cried in vain
      the victor daemon mounts obscure in air
      while the ship sails without the pilots care
      on neptunes faith the floating fleet relies
      but what the man forsook the god supplies
      and oer the dangrous deep secure the navy flies
      glides by the sirens cliffs a shelfy coast
      long infamous for ships and sailors lost
      and white with bones th impetuous ocean roars
      and rocks rebellow from the sounding shores
      the watchful hero felt the knocks and found
      the tossing vessel saild on shoaly ground
      sure of his pilots loss he takes himself
      the helm and steers aloof and shuns the shelf
      inly he grievd and groaning from the breast
      deplord his death and thus his pain expressd
      for faith reposd on seas and on the flattring sky
      thy naked corpse is doomd on shores unknown to lie





      he said and wept then spread his sails before
      the winds and reachd at length the cumaean shore
      their anchors droppd his crew the vessels moor
      they turn their heads to sea their sterns to land
      and greet with greedy joy th italian strand
      some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed
      some gather sticks the kindled flames to feed
      or search for hollow trees and fell the woods
      or trace thro valleys the discoverd floods
      thus while their sevral charges they fulfil
      the pious prince ascends the sacred hill
      where phoebus is adord and seeks the shade
      which hides from sight his venerable maid
      deep in a cave the sibyl makes abode
      thence full of fate returns and of the god
      thro trivias grove they walk and now behold
      and enter now the temple roofd with gold
      when daedalus to fly the cretan shore
      his heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore
       tis sung by fame
      to the cumaean coast at length he came
      and here alighting built this costly frame
      inscribd to phoebus here he hung on high
      the steerage of his wings that cut the sky
      then oer the lofty gate his art embossd
      androgeos death and offrings to his ghost
      sevn youths from athens yearly sent to meet
      the fate appointed by revengeful crete
      and next to those the dreadful urn was placd
      in which the destind names by lots were cast
      the mournful parents stand around in tears
      and rising crete against their shore appears
      there too in living sculpture might be seen
      the mad affection of the cretan queen
      then how she cheats her bellowing lovers eye
      the rushing leap the doubtful progeny
      the lower part a beast a man above
      the monument of their polluted love
      not far from thence he gravd the wondrous maze
      a thousand doors a thousand winding ways
      here dwells the monster hid from human view
      not to be found but by the faithful clue
      till the kind artist movd with pious grief
      lent to the loving maid this last relief
      and all those erring paths describd so well
      that theseus conquerd and the monster fell
      here hapless icarus had found his part
      had not the fathers grief restraind his art
      he twice assayd to cast his son in gold
      twice from his hands he droppd the forming mould

      all this with wondring eyes aeneas viewd
      each varying object his delight renewd
      eager to read the rest achates came
      and by his side the mad divining dame
      the priestess of the god deiphobe her name
      time suffers not she said to feed your eyes
      with empty pleasures haste the sacrifice
      sevn bullocks yet unyokd for phoebus choose
      and for diana sevn unspotted ewes
      this said the servants urge the sacred rites
      while to the temple she the prince invites
      a spacious cave within its farmost part
      was hewd and fashiond by laborious art
      thro the hills hollow sides before the place
      a hundred doors a hundred entries grace
      as many voices issue and the sound
      of sybils words as many times rebound
      now to the mouth they come aloud she cries
      this is the time enquire your destinies
      he comes behold the god thus while she said
      
      her colour changd her face was not the same
      and hollow groans from her deep spirit came
      her hair stood up convulsive rage possessd
      her trembling limbs and heavd her labring breast
      greater than humankind she seemd to look
      and with an accent more than mortal spoke
      her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll
      when all the god came rushing on her soul
      swiftly she turnd and foaming as she spoke
      why this delay she cried the powrs invoke
      thy prayrs alone can open this abode
      else vain are my demands and dumb the god

      she said no more the trembling trojans hear
      oerspread with a damp sweat and holy fear
      the prince himself with awful dread possessd
      his vows to great apollo thus addressd
      indulgent god propitious powr to troy
      swift to relieve unwilling to destroy
      directed by whose hand the dardan dart
      piercd the proud grecians only mortal part
      thus far by fates decrees and thy commands
      thro ambient seas and thro devouring sands
      our exild crew has sought th ausonian ground
      and now at length the flying coast is found
      thus far the fate of troy from place to place
      with fury has pursued her wandring race
      here cease ye powrs and let your vengeance end
      troy is no more and can no more offend
      and thou o sacred maid inspird to see
      th event of things in dark futurity
      give me what heavn has promisd to my fate
      to conquer and command the latian state
      to fix my wandring gods and find a place
      for the long exiles of the trojan race
      then shall my grateful hands a temple rear
      to the twin gods with vows and solemn prayr
      and annual rites and festivals and games
      shall be performd to their auspicious names
      nor shalt thou want thy honours in my land
      for there thy faithful oracles shall stand
      preservd in shrines and evry sacred lay
      which by thy mouth apollo shall convey
      all shall be treasurd by a chosen train
      of holy priests and ever shall remain
      but o commit not thy prophetic mind
      to flitting leaves the sport of evry wind
      lest they disperse in air our empty fate
      write not but what the powrs ordain relate

      struggling in vain impatient of her load
      and labring underneath the pondrous god
      the more she strove to shake him from her breast
      with more and far superior force he pressd
      commands his entrance and without control
      usurps her organs and inspires her soul
      now with a furious blast the hundred doors
      ope of themselves a rushing whirlwind roars
      within the cave and sibyls voice restores
      escapd the dangers of the watry reign
      yet more and greater ills by land remain
      the coast so long desird 
      thy troops shall reach but having reachd repent
      wars horrid wars i view a field of blood
      and tiber rolling with a purple flood
      simois nor xanthus shall be wanting there
      a new achilles shall in arms appear
      and he too goddessborn fierce junos hate
      added to hostile force shall urge thy fate
      to what strange nations shalt not thou resort
      drivn to solicit aid at evry court
      the cause the same which ilium once oppressd
      a foreign mistress and a foreign guest
      but thou secure of soul unbent with woes
      the more thy fortune frowns the more oppose
      the dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
      from whence thou least shalt hope a grecian town

      thus from the dark recess the sibyl spoke
      and the resisting air the thunder broke
      the cave rebellowd and the temple shook
      th ambiguous god who ruld her labring breast
      in these mysterious words his mind expressd
      some truths reveald in terms involvd the rest
      at length her fury fell her foaming ceasd
      and ebbing in her soul the god decreasd
      then thus the chief no terror to my view
      no frightful face of danger can be new
      inurd to suffer and resolvd to dare
      the fates without my powr shall be without my care
      this let me crave since near your grove the road
      to hell lies open and the dark abode
      which acheron surrounds th innavigable flood
      conduct me thro the regions void of light
      and lead me longing to my fathers sight
      for him a thousand dangers i have sought
      and rushing where the thickest grecians fought
      safe on my back the sacred burthen brought
      he for my sake the raging ocean tried
      and wrath of heavn my still auspicious guide
      and bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied
      oft since he breathd his last in dead of night
      his reverend image stood before my sight
      enjoind to seek below his holy shade
      conducted there by your unerring aid
      but you if pious minds by prayrs are won
      oblige the father and protect the son
      yours is the powr nor proserpine in vain
      has made you priestess of her nightly reign
      if orpheus armd with his enchanting lyre
      the ruthless king with pity could inspire
      and from the shades below redeem his wife
      if pollux offring his alternate life
      could free his brother and can daily go
      by turns aloft by turns descend below
      why name i theseus or his greater friend
      who trod the downward path and upward could ascend
      not less than theirs from jove my lineage came
      my mother greater my descent the same
      so prayd the trojan prince and while he prayd
      his hand upon the holy altar laid

      then thus replied the prophetess divine
      o goddessborn of great anchises line
      the gates of hell are open night and day
      smooth the descent and easy is the way
      but to return and view the cheerful skies
      in this the task and mighty labour lies
      to few great jupiter imparts this grace
      and those of shining worth and heavnly race
      betwixt those regions and our upper light
      deep forests and impenetrable night
      possess the middle space th infernal bounds
      cocytus with his sable waves surrounds
      but if so dire a love your soul invades
      as twice below to view the trembling shades
      if you so hard a toil will undertake
      as twice to pass th innavigable lake
      receive my counsel in the neighbring grove
      there stands a tree the queen of stygian jove
      claims it her own thick woods and gloomy night
      conceal the happy plant from human sight
      one bough it bears but wondrous to behold
      the ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold
      this from the vulgar branches must be torn
      and to fair proserpine the present borne
      ere leave be givn to tempt the nether skies
      the first thus rent a second will arise
      and the same metal the same room supplies
      look round the wood with lifted eyes to see
      the lurking gold upon the fatal tree
      then rend it off as holy rites command
      the willing metal will obey thy hand
      following with ease if favourd by thy fate
      thou art foredoomd to view the stygian state
      if not no labour can the tree constrain
      and strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain
      besides you know not while you here attend
      th unworthy fate of your unhappy friend
      breathless he lies and his unburied ghost
      deprivd of funral rites pollutes your host
      pay first his pious dues and for the dead
      two sable sheep around his hearse be led
      then living turfs upon his body lay
      this done securely take the destind way
      to find the regions destitute of day

      she said and held her peace aeneas went
      sad from the cave and full of discontent
      unknowing whom the sacred sibyl meant
      achates the companion of his breast
      goes grieving by his side with equal cares oppressd
      walking they talkd and fruitlessly divind
      what friend the priestess by those words designd
      but soon they found an object to deplore
      misenus lay extended on the shore
      son of the god of winds none so renownd
      the warrior trumpet in the field to sound
      with breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms
      and rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms
      he servd great hector and was ever near
      not with his trumpet only but his spear
      but by pelides arms when hector fell
      he chose aeneas and he chose as well
      swoln with applause and aiming still at more
      he now provokes the sea gods from the shore
      with envy triton heard the martial sound
      and the bold champion for his challenge drownd
      then cast his mangled carcass on the strand
      the gazing crowd around the body stand
      all weep but most aeneas mourns his fate
      and hastens to perform the funeral state
      in altarwise a stately pile they rear
      the basis broad below and top advancd in air
      an ancient wood fit for the work designd
      
      the trojans found the sounding ax is plied
      firs pines and pitch trees and the towring pride
      of forest ashes feel the fatal stroke
      and piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak
      huge trunks of trees felld from the steepy crown
      of the bare mountains roll with ruin down
      armd like the rest the trojan prince appears
      and by his pious labour urges theirs

      thus while he wrought revolving in his mind
      the ways to compass what his wish designd
      he cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove
      and then with vows implord the queen of love
      o may thy powr propitious still to me
      conduct my steps to find the fatal tree
      in this deep forest since the sibyls breath
      foretold alas too true misenus death
      scarce had he said when full before his sight
      two doves descending from their airy flight
      secure upon the grassy plain alight
      he knew his mothers birds and thus he prayd
      be you my guides with your auspicious aid
      and lead my footsteps till the branch be found
      whose glittring shadow gilds the sacred ground
      and thou great parent with celestial care
      in this distress be present to my prayr
      thus having said he stoppd with watchful sight
      observing still the motions of their flight
      what course they took what happy signs they shew
      they fed and fluttring by degrees withdrew
      still farther from the place but still in view
      hopping and flying thus they led him on
      to the slow lake whose baleful stench to shun
      they wingd their flight aloft then stooping low
      perchd on the double tree that bears the golden bough
      thro the green leafs the glittring shadows glow
      as on the sacred oak the wintry mistletoe
      where the proud mother views her precious brood
      and happier branches which she never sowd
      such was the glittring such the ruddy rind
      and dancing leaves that wantond in the wind
      he seizd the shining bough with griping hold
      and rent away with ease the lingring gold
      then to the sibyls palace bore the prize
      meantime the trojan troops with weeping eyes
      to dead misenus pay his obsequies
      first from the ground a lofty pile they rear
      of pitch trees oaks and pines and unctuous fir
      the fabrics front with cypress twigs they strew
      and stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew
      the topmost part his glittring arms adorn
      warm waters then in brazen caldrons borne
      are pourd to wash his body joint by joint
      and fragrant oils the stiffend limbs anoint
      with groans and cries misenus they deplore
      then on a bier with purple coverd oer
      the breathless body thus bewaild they lay
      and fire the pile their faces turnd away
      such reverend rites their fathers usd to pay
      pure oil and incense on the fire they throw
      and fat of victims which his friends bestow
      these gifts the greedy flames to dust devour
      then on the living coals red wine they pour
      and last the relics by themselves dispose
      which in a brazen urn the priests inclose
      old corynaeus compassd thrice the crew
      and dippd an olive branch in holy dew
      which thrice he sprinkled round and thrice aloud
      invokd the dead and then dismissed the crowd
      but good aeneas orderd on the shore
      a stately tomb whose top a trumpet bore
      a soldiers falchion and a seamans oar
      thus was his friend interrd and deathless fame
      still to the lofty cape consigns his name
      these rites performd the prince without delay
      hastes to the nether world his destind way
      deep was the cave and downward as it went
      from the wide mouth a rocky rough descent
      and here th access a gloomy grove defends
      and there th unnavigable lake extends
      oer whose unhappy waters void of light
      no bird presumes to steer his airy flight
      such deadly stenches from the depths arise
      and steaming sulphur that infects the skies
      from hence the grecian bards their legends make
      and give the name avernus to the lake
      four sable bullocks in the yoke untaught
      for sacrifice the pious hero brought
      the priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns
      then cuts the curling hair that first oblation burns
      invoking hecate hither to repair
      a powrful name in hell and upper air
      the sacred priests with ready knives bereave
      the beasts of life and in full bowls receive
      the streaming blood a lamb to hell and night
      
      aeneas offers and by fates decree
      a barren heifer proserpine to thee
      with holocausts he plutos altar fills
      sevn brawny bulls with his own hand he kills
      then on the broiling entrails oil he pours
      which ointed thus the raging flame devours
      late the nocturnal sacrifice begun
      nor ended till the next returning sun
      then earth began to bellow trees to dance
      and howling dogs in glimmring light advance
      ere hecate came far hence be souls profane
      the sibyl cried and from the grove abstain
      now trojan take the way thy fates afford
      assume thy courage and unsheathe thy sword
      she said and passd along the gloomy space
      the prince pursued her steps with equal pace

      ye realms yet unreveald to human sight
      ye gods who rule the regions of the night
      ye gliding ghosts permit me to relate
      the mystic wonders of your silent state

      obscure they went thro dreary shades that led
      along the waste dominions of the dead
      thus wander travelers in woods by night
      by the moons doubtful and malignant light
      when jove in dusky clouds involves the skies
      and the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes

      just in the gate and in the jaws of hell
      revengeful cares and sullen sorrows dwell
      and pale diseases and repining age
      want fear and famines unresisted rage
      here toils and death and deaths halfbrother sleep
      forms terrible to view their sentry keep
      with anxious pleasures of a guilty mind
      deep frauds before and open force behind
      the furies iron beds and strife that shakes
      her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes
      full in the midst of this infernal road
      an elm displays her dusky arms abroad
      the god of sleep there hides his heavy head
      and empty dreams on evry leaf are spread
      of various forms unnumberd spectres more
      centaurs and double shapes besiege the door
      before the passage horrid hydra stands
      and briareus with all his hundred hands
      gorgons geryon with his triple frame
      and vain chimaera vomits empty flame
      the chief unsheathd his shining steel prepard
      tho seizd with sudden fear to force the guard
      offring his brandishd weapon at their face
      had not the sibyl stoppd his eager pace
      and told him what those empty phantoms were
      forms without bodies and impassive air
      hence to deep acheron they take their way
      whose troubled eddies thick with ooze and clay
      are whirld aloft and in cocytus lost
      there charon stands who rules the dreary coast
      a sordid god down from his hoary chin
      a length of beard descends uncombd unclean
      his eyes like hollow furnaces on fire
      a girdle foul with grease binds his obscene attire
      he spreads his canvas with his pole he steers
      the freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears
      he lookd in years yet in his years were seen
      a youthful vigour and autumnal green
      an airy crowd came rushing where he stood
      which filld the margin of the fatal flood
      husbands and wives boys and unmarried maids
      and mighty heroes more majestic shades
      and youths intombd before their fathers eyes
      with hollow groans and shrieks and feeble cries
      thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods
      or fowls by winter forcd forsake the floods
      and wing their hasty flight to happier lands
      such and so thick the shivring army stands
      and press for passage with extended hands
      now these now those the surly boatman bore
      the rest he drove to distance from the shore
      the hero who beheld with wondring eyes
      the tumult mixd with shrieks laments and cries
      askd of his guide what the rude concourse meant
      why to the shore the thronging people bent
      what forms of law among the ghosts were usd
      why some were ferried oer and some refusd

      son of anchises offspring of the gods
      the sibyl said you see the stygian floods
      the sacred stream which heavns imperial state
      attests in oaths and fears to violate
      the ghosts rejected are th unhappy crew
      deprivd of sepulchers and funral due
      the boatman charon those the buried host
      he ferries over to the farther coast
      nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
      with such whose bones are not composd in graves
      a hundred years they wander on the shore
      at length their penance done are wafted oer
      the trojan chief his forward pace repressd
      revolving anxious thoughts within his breast
      he saw his friends who whelmd beneath the waves
      their funral honours claimd and askd their quiet graves
      the lost leucaspis in the crowd he knew
      and the brave leader of the lycian crew
      whom on the tyrrhene seas the tempests met
      the sailors masterd and the ship oerset

      amidst the spirits palinurus pressd
      yet fresh from life a newadmitted guest
      who while he steering viewd the stars and bore
      his course from afric to the latian shore
      fell headlong down the trojan fixd his view
      and scarcely thro the gloom the sullen shadow knew
      then thus the prince what envious powr o friend
      brought your lovd life to this disastrous end
      for phoebus ever true in all he said
      has in your fate alone my faith betrayd
      the god foretold you should not die before
      you reachd secure from seas th italian shore
      is this th unerring powr the ghost replied
      nor phoebus flatterd nor his answers lied
      nor envious gods have sent me to the deep
      but while the stars and course of heavn i keep
      my wearied eyes were seizd with fatal sleep
      i fell and with my weight the helm constraind
      was drawn along which yet my gripe retaind
      now by the winds and raging waves i swear
      your safety more than mine was then my care
      lest of the guide bereft the rudder lost
      your ship should run against the rocky coast
      three blustring nights borne by the southern blast
      i floated and discoverd land at last
      high on a mounting wave my head i bore
      forcing my strength and gathring to the shore
      panting but past the danger now i seizd
      the craggy cliffs and my tird members easd
      while cumberd with my dropping clothes i lay
      the cruel nation covetous of prey
      staind with my blood th unhospitable coast
      and now by winds and waves my lifeless limbs are tossd
      which o avert by yon ethereal light
      which i have lost for this eternal night
      or if by dearer ties you may be won
      by your dead sire and by your living son
      redeem from this reproach my wandring ghost
      or with your navy seek the velin coast
      and in a peaceful grave my corpse compose
      or if a nearer way your mother shows
      without whose aid you durst not undertake
      this frightful passage oer the stygian lake
      lend to this wretch your hand and waft him oer
      to the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore
      scarce had he said the prophetess began
      what hopes delude thee miserable man
      thinkst thou thus unintombd to cross the floods
      to view the furies and infernal gods
      and visit without leave the dark abodes
      attend the term of long revolving years
      fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears
      this comfort of thy dire misfortune take
      the wrath of heavn inflicted for thy sake
      with vengeance shall pursue th inhuman coast
      till they propitiate thy offended ghost
      and raise a tomb with vows and solemn prayr
      and palinurus name the place shall bear
      this calmd his cares soothd with his future fame
      and pleasd to hear his propagated name

      now nearer to the stygian lake they draw
      whom from the shore the surly boatman saw
      observd their passage thro the shady wood
      and markd their near approaches to the flood
      then thus he calld aloud inflamd with wrath
      mortal whateer who this forbidden path
      in arms presumst to tread i charge thee stand
      and tell thy name and busness in the land
      know this the realm of night the stygian shore
      my boat conveys no living bodies oer
      nor was i pleasd great theseus once to bear
      who forcd a passage with his pointed spear
      nor strong alcides men of mighty fame
      and from th immortal gods their lineage came
      in fetters one the barking porter tied
      and took him trembling from his sovreigns side
      two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride
      to whom the sibyl thus compose thy mind
      nor frauds are here contrivd nor force designd
      still may the dog the wandring troops constrain
      of airy ghosts and vex the guilty train
      and with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain
      the trojan chief whose lineage is from jove
      much famd for arms and more for filial love
      is sent to seek his sire in your elysian grove
      if neither piety nor heavns command
      can gain his passage to the stygian strand
      this fatal present shall prevail at least
      then shewd the shining bough conceald within her vest
      no more was needful for the gloomy god
      stood mute with awe to see the golden rod
      admird the destind offring to his queen
      a venerable gift so rarely seen
      his fury thus appeasd he puts to land
      the ghosts forsake their seats at his command
      he clears the deck receives the mighty freight
      the leaky vessel groans beneath the weight
      slowly she sails and scarcely stems the tides
      the pressing water pours within her sides
      his passengers at length are wafted oer
      exposd in muddy weeds upon the miry shore

      no sooner landed in his den they found
      the triple porter of the stygian sound
      grim cerberus who soon began to rear
      his crested snakes and armd his bristling hair
      the prudent sibyl had before prepard
      a sop in honey steepd to charm the guard
      which mixd with powrful drugs she cast before
      his greedy grinning jaws just opd to roar
      with three enormous mouths he gapes and straight
      with hunger pressd devours the pleasing bait
      long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave
      he reels and falling fills the spacious cave
      the keeper charmd the chief without delay
      passd on and took th irremeable way
      before the gates the cries of babes new born
      whom fate had from their tender mothers torn
      assault his ears then those whom form of laws
      condemnd to die when traitors judgd their cause
      nor want they lots nor judges to review
      the wrongful sentence and award a new
      minos the strict inquisitor appears
      and lives and crimes with his assessors hears
      round in his urn the blended balls he rolls
      absolves the just and dooms the guilty souls
      the next in place and punishment are they
      who prodigally throw their souls away
      fools who repining at their wretched state
      and loathing anxious life subornd their fate
      with late repentance now they would retrieve
      the bodies they forsook and wish to live
      their pains and poverty desire to bear
      to view the light of heavn and breathe the vital air
      but fate forbids the stygian floods oppose
      and with circling streams the captive souls inclose

      not far from thence the mournful fields appear
      so calld from lovers that inhabit there
      the souls whom that unhappy flame invades
      in secret solitude and myrtle shades
      make endless moans and pining with desire
      lament too late their unextinguishd fire
      here procris eriphyle here he found
      baring her breast yet bleeding with the wound
      made by her son he saw pasiphae there
      with phaedras ghost a foul incestuous pair
      there laodamia with evadne moves
      unhappy both but loyal in their loves
      caeneus a woman once and once a man
      but ending in the sex she first began
      not far from these phoenician dido stood
      fresh from her wound her bosom bathd in blood
      whom when the trojan hero hardly knew
      obscure in shades and with a doubtful view
      
      with tears he first approachd the sullen shade
      and as his love inspird him thus he said
      unhappy queen then is the common breath
      of rumour true in your reported death
      and i alas the cause by heavn i vow
      and all the powrs that rule the realms below
      unwilling i forsook your friendly state
      commanded by the gods and forcd by fate
      those gods that fate whose unresisted might
      have sent me to these regions void of light
      thro the vast empire of eternal night
      nor dard i to presume that pressd with grief
      my flight should urge you to this dire relief
      stay stay your steps and listen to my vows
      tis the last interview that fate allows
      in vain he thus attempts her mind to move
      with tears and prayrs and laterepenting love
      disdainfully she lookd then turning round
      but fixd her eyes unmovd upon the ground
      and what he says and swears regards no more
      than the deaf rocks when the loud billows roar
      but whirld away to shun his hateful sight
      hid in the forest and the shades of night
      then sought sichaeus thro the shady grove
      who answerd all her cares and equald all her love

      some pious tears the pitying hero paid
      and followd with his eyes the flitting shade
      then took the forward way by fate ordaind
      and with his guide the farther fields attaind
      where severd from the rest the warrior souls remaind
      tydeus he met with meleagers race
      the pride of armies and the soldiers grace
      and pale adrastus with his ghastly face
      of trojan chiefs he viewd a numrous train
      all much lamented all in battle slain
      glaucus and medon high above the rest
      antenors sons and ceres sacred priest
      and proud idaeus priams charioteer
      who shakes his empty reins and aims his airy spear
      the gladsome ghosts in circling troops attend
      and with unwearied eyes behold their friend
      delight to hover near and long to know
      what busness brought him to the realms below
      but argive chiefs and agamemnons train
      when his refulgent arms flashd thro the shady plain
      fled from his wellknown face with wonted fear
      as when his thundring sword and pointed spear
      drove headlong to their ships and gleand the routed rear
      they raisd a feeble cry with trembling notes
      but the weak voice deceivd their gasping throats

      here priams son deiphobus he found
      whose face and limbs were one continued wound
      dishonest with loppd arms the youth appears
      spoild of his nose and shortend of his ears
      he scarcely knew him striving to disown
      his blotted form and blushing to be known
      and therefore first began o teucers race
      who durst thy faultless figure thus deface
      what heart could wish what hand inflict this dire disgrace
      twas famd that in our last and fatal night
      your single prowess long sustaind the fight
      till tird not forcd a glorious fate you chose
      and fell upon a heap of slaughterd foes
      but in remembrance of so brave a deed
      a tomb and funral honours i decreed
      thrice calld your manes on the trojan plains
      the place your armour and your name retains
      your body too i sought and had i found
      designd for burial in your native ground

      the ghost replied your piety has paid
      all needful rites to rest my wandring shade
      but cruel fate and my more cruel wife
      to grecian swords betrayd my sleeping life
      these are the monuments of helens love
      the shame i bear below the marks i bore above
      you know in what deluding joys we passd
      the night that was by heavn decreed our last
      for when the fatal horse descending down
      pregnant with arms oerwhelmd th unhappy town
      she feignd nocturnal orgies left my bed
      and mixd with trojan dames the dances led
      then waving high her torch the signal made
      which rousd the grecians from their ambuscade
      with watching overworn with cares oppressd
      unhappy i had laid me down to rest
      and heavy sleep my weary limbs possessd
      meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid
      and from beneath my head my sword conveyd
      the door unlatchd and with repeated calls
      invites her former lord within my walls
      thus in her crime her confidence she placd
      and with new treasons would redeem the past
      what need i more into the room they ran
      and meanly murderd a defenceless man
      ulysses basely born first led the way
      avenging powrs with justice if i pray
      that fortune be their own another day
      but answer you and in your turn relate
      what brought you living to the stygian state
      drivn by the winds and errors of the sea
      or did you heavns superior doom obey
      or tell what other chance conducts your way
      to view with mortal eyes our dark retreats
      tumults and torments of th infernal seats

      while thus in talk the flying hours they pass
      the sun had finishd more than half his race
      and they perhaps in words and tears had spent
      the little time of stay which heavn had lent
      but thus the sibyl chides their long delay
      night rushes down and headlong drives the day
      tis here in different paths the way divides
      the right to plutos golden palace guides
      the left to that unhappy region tends
      which to the depth of tartarus descends
      the seat of night profound and punishd fiends
      then thus deiphobus o sacred maid
      forbear to chide and be your will obeyd
      lo to the secret shadows i retire
      to pay my penance till my years expire
      proceed auspicious prince with glory crownd
      and born to better fates than i have found
      he said and while he said his steps he turnd
      to secret shadows and in silence mournd

      the hero looking on the left espied
      a lofty towr and strong on evry side
      with treble walls which phlegethon surrounds
      whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds
      and pressd betwixt the rocks the bellowing noise resounds
      wide is the fronting gate and raisd on high
      with adamantine columns threats the sky
      vain is the force of man and heavns as vain
      to crush the pillars which the pile sustain
      sublime on these a towr of steel is reard
      and dire tisiphone there keeps the ward
      girt in her sanguine gown by night and day
      observant of the souls that pass the downward way
      from hence are heard the groans of ghosts the pains
      of sounding lashes and of dragging chains
      the trojan stood astonishd at their cries
      and askd his guide from whence those yells arise
      and what the crimes and what the tortures were
      and loud laments that rent the liquid air

      she thus replied the chaste and holy race
      are all forbidden this polluted place
      but hecate when she gave to rule the woods
      then led me trembling thro these dire abodes
      and taught the tortures of th avenging gods
      these are the realms of unrelenting fate
      and awful rhadamanthus rules the state
      he hears and judges each committed crime
      enquires into the manner place and time
      the conscious wretch must all his acts reveal
      loth to confess unable to conceal
      from the first moment of his vital breath
      to his last hour of unrepenting death
      straight oer the guilty ghost the fury shakes
      the sounding whip and brandishes her snakes
      and the pale sinner with her sisters takes
      then of itself unfolds th eternal door
      with dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar
      you see before the gate what stalking ghost
      commands the guard what sentries keep the post
      more formidable hydra stands within
      whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin
      the gaping gulf low to the centre lies
      and twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies
      the rivals of the gods the titan race
      here singd with lightning roll within th unfathomd space
      here lie th alaean twins 
      enormous bodies of gigantic growth
      who dard in fight the thundrer to defy
      affect his heavn and force him from the sky
      salmoneus suffring cruel pains i found
      for emulating jove the rattling sound
      of mimic thunder and the glittring blaze
      of pointed lightnings and their forky rays
      thro elis and the grecian towns he flew
      th audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew
      he wavd a torch aloft and madly vain
      sought godlike worship from a servile train
      ambitious fool with horny hoofs to pass
      oer hollow arches of resounding brass
      to rival thunder in its rapid course
      and imitate inimitable force
      but he the king of heavn obscure on high
      bard his red arm and launching from the sky
      his writhen bolt not shaking empty smoke
      down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook
      there tityus was to see who took his birth
      from heavn his nursing from the foodful earth
      here his gigantic limbs with large embrace
      infold nine acres of infernal space
      a ravnous vulture in his opend side
      her crooked beak and cruel talons tried
      still for the growing liver diggd his breast
      the growing liver still supplied the feast
      still are his entrails fruitful to their pains
      th immortal hunger lasts th immortal food remains
      ixion and perithous i could name
      and more thessalian chiefs of mighty fame
      high oer their heads a mouldring rock is placd
      that promises a fall and shakes at evry blast
      they lie below on golden beds displayd
      and genial feasts with regal pomp are made
      the queen of furies by their sides is set
      and snatches from their mouths th untasted meat
      which if they touch her hissing snakes she rears
      tossing her torch and thundring in their ears
      then they who brothers better claim disown
      expel their parents and usurp the throne
      defraud their clients and to lucre sold
      sit brooding on unprofitable gold
      who dare not give and evn refuse to lend
      to their poor kindred or a wanting friend
      vast is the throng of these nor less the train
      of lustful youths for foul adultry slain
      hosts of deserters who their honour sold
      and basely broke their faith for bribes of gold
      all these within the dungeons depth remain
      despairing pardon and expecting pain
      ask not what pains nor farther seek to know
      their process or the forms of law below
      some roll a weighty stone some laid along
      and bound with burning wires on spokes of wheels are hung
      unhappy theseus doomd for ever there
      is fixd by fate on his eternal chair
      and wretched phlegyas warns the world with cries
      
      learn righteousness and dread th avenging deities
      to tyrants others have their country sold
      imposing foreign lords for foreign gold
      some have old laws repeald new statutes made
      not as the people pleasd but as they paid
      with incest some their daughters bed profand
      all dard the worst of ills and what they dard attaind
      had i a hundred mouths a hundred tongues
      and throats of brass inspird with iron lungs
      i could not half those horrid crimes repeat
      nor half the punishments those crimes have met
      but let us haste our voyage to pursue
      the walls of plutos palace are in view
      the gate and iron arch above it stands
      on anvils labourd by the cyclops hands
      before our farther way the fates allow
      here must we fix on high the golden bough

      she said and thro the gloomy shades they passd
      and chose the middle path arrivd at last
      the prince with living water sprinkled oer
      his limbs and body then approachd the door
      possessd the porch and on the front above
      he fixd the fatal bough requird by plutos love
      these holy rites performd they took their way
      where long extended plains of pleasure lay
      the verdant fields with those of heavn may vie
      with ether vested and a purple sky
      the blissful seats of happy souls below
      stars of their own and their own suns they know
      their airy limbs in sports they exercise
      and on the green contend the wrestlers prize
      some in heroic verse divinely sing
      others in artful measures led the ring
      the thracian bard surrounded by the rest
      there stands conspicuous in his flowing vest
      his flying fingers and harmonious quill
      strikes sevn distinguishd notes and sevn at once they fill
      here found they teucers old heroic race
      born better times and happier years to grace
      assaracus and ilus here enjoy
      perpetual fame with him who founded troy
      the chief beheld their chariots from afar
      their shining arms and coursers traind to war
      their lances fixd in earth their steeds around
      free from their harness graze the flowry ground
      the love of horses which they had alive
      and care of chariots after death survive
      some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain
      some did the song and some the choir maintain
      beneath a laurel shade where mighty po
      mounts up to woods above and hides his head below
      here patriots live who for their countrys good
      in fighting fields were prodigal of blood
      priests of unblemishd lives here make abode
      and poets worthy their inspiring god
      and searching wits of more mechanic parts
      who gracd their age with newinvented arts
      those who to worth their bounty did extend
      and those who knew that bounty to commend
      the heads of these with holy fillets bound
      and all their temples were with garlands crownd

      to these the sibyl thus her speech addressd
      and first to him surrounded by the rest
      towring his height and ample was his breast
      say happy souls divine musaeus say
      where lives anchises and where lies our way
      to find the hero for whose only sake
      we sought the dark abodes and crossd the bitter lake
      to this the sacred poet thus replied
      in no fixd place the happy souls reside
      in groves we live and lie on mossy beds
      by crystal streams that murmur thro the meads
      but pass yon easy hill and thence descend
      the path conducts you to your journeys end
      this said he led them up the mountains brow
      and shews them all the shining fields below
      they wind the hill and thro the blissful meadows go

      but old anchises in a flowry vale
      reviewd his musterd race and took the tale
      those happy spirits which ordaind by fate
      for future beings and new bodies wait
      with studious thought observd th illustrious throng
      in natures order as they passd along
      their names their fates their conduct and their care
      in peaceful senates and successful war
      he when aeneas on the plain appears
      meets him with open arms and falling tears
      welcome he said the gods undoubted race
      o long expected to my dear embrace
      once more tis givn me to behold your face
      the love and pious duty which you pay
      have passd the perils of so hard a way
      tis true computing times i now believd
      the happy day approachd nor are my hopes deceivd
      what length of lands what oceans have you passd
      what storms sustaind and on what shores been cast
      how have i feard your fate but feard it most
      when love assaild you on the libyan coast
      to this the filial duty thus replies
      your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes
      appeard and often urgd this painful enterprise
      after long tossing on the tyrrhene sea
      my navy rides at anchor in the bay
      but reach your hand o parent shade nor shun
      the dear embraces of your longing son
      he said and falling tears his face bedew
      then thrice around his neck his arms he threw
      and thrice the flitting shadow slippd away
      like winds or empty dreams that fly the day

      now in a secret vale the trojan sees
      a seprate grove thro which a gentle breeze
      plays with a passing breath and whispers thro the trees
      and just before the confines of the wood
      the gliding lethe leads her silent flood
      about the boughs an airy nation flew
      thick as the humming bees that hunt the golden dew
      in summers heat on tops of lilies feed
      and creep within their bells to suck the balmy seed
      the winged army roams the fields around
      the rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound
      aeneas wondring stood then askd the cause
      which to the stream the crowding people draws
      then thus the sire the souls that throng the flood
      are those to whom by fate are other bodies owd
      in lethes lake they long oblivion taste
      of future life secure forgetful of the past
      long has my soul desird this time and place
      to set before your sight your glorious race
      that this presaging joy may fire your mind
      to seek the shores by destiny designd
      o father can it be that souls sublime
      return to visit our terrestrial clime
      and that the genrous mind releasd by death
      can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath

      anchises then in order thus begun
      to clear those wonders to his godlike son
      know first that heavn and earths compacted frame
      and flowing waters and the starry flame
      and both the radiant lights one common soul
      inspires and feeds and animates the whole
      this active mind infusd thro all the space
      unites and mingles with the mighty mass
      hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain
      and birds of air and monsters of the main
      th ethereal vigour is in all the same
      and every soul is filld with equal flame
      as much as earthy limbs and gross allay
      of mortal members subject to decay
      blunt not the beams of heavn and edge of day
      from this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts
      desire and fear by turns possess their hearts
      and grief and joy nor can the groveling mind
      in the dark dungeon of the limbs confind
      assert the native skies or own its heavnly kind
      nor death itself can wholly wash their stains
      but longcontracted filth evn in the soul remains
      the relics of inveterate vice they wear
      and spots of sin obscene in evry face appear
      for this are various penances enjoind
      and some are hung to bleach upon the wind
      some plungd in waters others purgd in fires
      till all the dregs are draind and all the rust expires
      all have their manes and those manes bear
      the few so cleansd to these abodes repair
      and breathe in ample fields the soft elysian air
      then are they happy when by length of time
      the scurf is worn away of each committed crime
      no speck is left of their habitual stains
      but the pure ether of the soul remains
      but when a thousand rolling years are past
      
      whole droves of minds are by the driving god
      compelld to drink the deep lethaean flood
      in large forgetful draughts to steep the cares
      of their past labours and their irksome years
      that unremembring of its former pain
      the soul may suffer mortal flesh again

      thus having said the father spirit leads
      the priestess and his son thro swarms of shades
      and takes a rising ground from thence to see
      the long procession of his progeny
      survey pursued the sire this airy throng
      as offerd to thy view they pass along
      these are th italian names which fate will join
      with ours and graff upon the trojan line
      observe the youth who first appears in sight
      and holds the nearest station to the light
      already seems to snuff the vital air
      and leans just forward on a shining spear
      silvius is he thy lastbegotten race
      but first in order sent to fill thy place
      an alban name but mixd with dardan blood
      born in the covert of a shady wood
      him fair lavinia thy surviving wife
      shall breed in groves to lead a solitary life
      in alba he shall fix his royal seat
      and born a king a race of kings beget
      then procas honour of the trojan name
      capys and numitor of endless fame
      a second silvius after these appears
      silvius aeneas for thy name he bears
      for arms and justice equally renownd
      who late restord in alba shall be crownd
      how great they look how vigrously they wield
      their weighty lances and sustain the shield
      but they who crownd with oaken wreaths appear
      shall gabian walls and strong fidena rear
      nomentum bola with pometia found
      and raise collatian towrs on rocky ground
      all these shall then be towns of mighty fame
      tho now they lie obscure and lands without a name
      see romulus the great born to restore
      the crown that once his injurd grandsire wore
      this prince a priestess of your blood shall bear
      and like his sire in arms he shall appear
      two rising crests his royal head adorn
      born from a god himself to godhead born
      his sire already signs him for the skies
      and marks the seat amidst the deities
      auspicious chief thy race in times to come
      shall spread the conquests of imperial rome
      rome whose ascending towrs shall heavn invade
      involving earth and ocean in her shade
      high as the mother of the gods in place
      and proud like her of an immortal race
      then when in pomp she makes the phrygian round
      with golden turrets on her temples crownd
      a hundred gods her sweeping train supply
      her offspring all and all command the sky

      now fix your sight and stand intent to see
      your roman race and julian progeny
      the mighty caesar waits his vital hour
      impatient for the world and grasps his promisd powr
      but next behold the youth of form divine
      caesar himself exalted in his line
      augustus promisd oft and long foretold
      sent to the realm that saturn ruld of old
      born to restore a better age of gold
      afric and india shall his powr obey
      he shall extend his propagated sway
      beyond the solar year without the starry way
      where atlas turns the rolling heavns around
      and his broad shoulders with their lights are crownd
      at his foreseen approach already quake
      the caspian kingdoms and maeotian lake
      their seers behold the tempest from afar
      and threatning oracles denounce the war
      nile hears him knocking at his sevnfold gates
      and seeks his hidden spring and fears his nephews fates
      nor hercules more lands or labours knew
      not tho the brazenfooted hind he slew
      freed erymanthus from the foaming boar
      and dippd his arrows in lernaean gore
      nor bacchus turning from his indian war
      by tigers drawn triumphant in his car
      from nisus top descending on the plains
      with curling vines around his purple reins
      and doubt we yet thro dangers to pursue
      the paths of honour and a crown in view
      but whats the man who from afar appears
      his head with olive crownd his hand a censer bears
      his hoary beard and holy vestments bring
      his lost idea back i know the roman king
      he shall to peaceful rome new laws ordain
      calld from his mean abode a scepter to sustain
      him tullus next in dignity succeeds
      an active prince and prone to martial deeds
      he shall his troops for fighting fields prepare
      disusd to toils and triumphs of the war
      by dint of sword his crown he shall increase
      and scour his armour from the rust of peace
      whom ancus follows with a fawning air
      but vain within and proudly popular
      next view the tarquin kings th avenging sword
      of brutus justly drawn and rome restord
      he first renews the rods and ax severe
      and gives the consuls royal robes to wear
      his sons who seek the tyrant to sustain
      and long for arbitrary lords again
      with ignominy scourgd in open sight
      he dooms to death deservd asserting public right
      unhappy man to break the pious laws
      of nature pleading in his childrens cause
      howeer the doubtful fact is understood
      tis love of honour and his countrys good
      the consul not the father sheds the blood
      behold torquatus the same track pursue
      and next the two devoted decii view
      the drusian line camillus loaded home
      with standards well redeemd and foreign foes oercome
      the pair you see in equal armour shine
      now friends below in close embraces join
      but when they leave the shady realms of night
      and clothd in bodies breathe your upper light
      with mortal hate each other shall pursue
      what wars what wounds what slaughter shall ensue
      from alpine heights the father first descends
      his daughters husband in the plain attends
      his daughters husband arms his eastern friends
      embrace again my sons be foes no more
      nor stain your country with her childrens gore
      and thou the first lay down thy lawless claim
      thou of my blood who bearst the julian name
      another comes who shall in triumph ride
      and to the capitol his chariot guide
      from conquerd corinth rich with grecian spoils
      and yet another famd for warlike toils
      on argos shall impose the roman laws
      and on the greeks revenge the trojan cause
      shall drag in chains their achillean race
      shall vindicate his ancestors disgrace
      and pallas for her violated place
      great cato there for gravity renownd
      and conquring cossus goes with laurels crownd
      who can omit the gracchi who declare
      the scipios worth those thunderbolts of war
      the double bane of carthage who can see
      without esteem for virtuous poverty
      severe fabricius or can cease t admire
      the plowman consul in his coarse attire
      tird as i am my praise the fabii claim
      and thou great hero greatest of thy name
      ordaind in war to save the sinking state
      and by delays to put a stop to fate
      let others better mould the running mass
      of metals and inform the breathing brass
      and soften into flesh a marble face
      plead better at the bar describe the skies
      and when the stars descend and when they rise
      but rome tis thine alone with awful sway
      to rule mankind and make the world obey
      disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way
      to tame the proud the fetterd slave to free
      these are imperial arts and worthy thee

      he pausd and while with wondring eyes they viewd
      the passing spirits thus his speech renewd
      see great marcellus how untird in toils
      he moves with manly grace how rich with regal spoils
      he when his country threatend with alarms
      requires his courage and his conquring arms
      shall more than once the punic bands affright
      shall kill the gaulish king in single fight
      then to the capitol in triumph move
      and the third spoils shall grace feretrian jove
      aeneas here beheld of form divine
      a godlike youth in glittring armour shine
      with great marcellus keeping equal pace
      but gloomy were his eyes dejected was his face
      he saw and wondring askd his airy guide
      what and of whence was he who pressd the heros side
      his son or one of his illustrious name
      how like the former and almost the same
      observe the crowds that compass him around
      all gaze and all admire and raise a shouting sound
      but hovring mists around his brows are spread
      and night with sable shades involves his head
      seek not to know the ghost replied with tears
      the sorrows of thy sons in future years
      this youth 
      shall just be shown on earth and snatchd away
      the gods too high had raisd the roman state
      were but their gifts as permanent as great
      what groans of men shall fill the martian field
      how fierce a blaze his flaming pile shall yield
      what funral pomp shall floating tiber see
      when rising from his bed he views the sad solemnity
      no youth shall equal hopes of glory give
      no youth afford so great a cause to grieve
      the trojan honour and the roman boast
      admird when living and adord when lost
      mirror of ancient faith in early youth
      undaunted worth inviolable truth
      no foe unpunishd in the fighting field
      shall dare thee foot to foot with sword and shield
      much less in arms oppose thy matchless force
      when thy sharp spurs shall urge thy foaming horse
      ah couldst thou break thro fates severe decree
      a new marcellus shall arise in thee
      full canisters of fragrant lilies bring
      mixd with the purple roses of the spring
      let me with funral flowrs his body strow
      this gift which parents to their children owe
      this unavailing gift at least i may bestow
      thus having said he led the hero round
      the confines of the blest elysian ground
      which when anchises to his son had shown
      and fird his mind to mount the promisd throne
      he tells the future wars ordaind by fate
      the strength and customs of the latian state
      the prince and people and forearms his care
      with rules to push his fortune or to bear

      two gates the silent house of sleep adorn
      of polishd ivory this that of transparent horn
      true visions thro transparent horn arise
      thro polishd ivory pass deluding lies
      of various things discoursing as he passd
      anchises hither bends his steps at last
      then thro the gate of ivry he dismissd
      his valiant offspring and divining guest
      straight to the ships aeneas took his way
      embarkd his men and skimmd along the sea
      still coasting till he gaind cajetas bay
      at length on oozy ground his galleys moor
      their heads are turnd to sea their sterns to shore



 

      and thou o matron of immortal fame
      here dying to the shore hast left thy name
      cajeta still the place is calld from thee
      the nurse of great aeneas infancy
      here rest thy bones in rich hesperias plains
      thy name  remains

      now when the prince her funral rites had paid
      he plowd the tyrrhene seas with sails displayd
      from land a gentle breeze arose by night
      serenely shone the stars the moon was bright
      and the sea trembled with her silver light
      now near the shelves of circes shores they run
      
      a dangrous coast the goddess wastes her days
      in joyous songs the rocks resound her lays
      in spinning or the loom she spends the night
      and cedar brands supply her fathers light
      from hence were heard rebellowing to the main
      the roars of lions that refuse the chain
      the grunts of bristled boars and groans of bears
      and herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears
      these from their caverns at the close of night
      fill the sad isle with horror and affright
      darkling they mourn their fate whom circes powr
      
      with words and wicked herbs from humankind
      had alterd and in brutal shapes confind
      which monsters lest the trojans pious host
      should bear or touch upon th inchanted coast
      propitious neptune steerd their course by night
      with rising gales that sped their happy flight
      supplied with these they skim the sounding shore
      and hear the swelling surges vainly roar
      now when the rosy morn began to rise
      and wavd her saffron streamer thro the skies
      when thetis blushd in purple not her own
      and from her face the breathing winds were blown
      a sudden silence sate upon the sea
      and sweeping oars with struggling urge their way
      the trojan from the main beheld a wood
      which thick with shades and a brown horror stood
      betwixt the trees the tiber took his course
      with whirlpools dimpled and with downward force
      that drove the sand along he took his way
      and rolld his yellow billows to the sea
      about him and above and round the wood
      the birds that haunt the borders of his flood
      that bathd within or basked upon his side
      to tuneful songs their narrow throats applied
      the captain gives command the joyful train
      glide thro the gloomy shade and leave the main

      now erato thy poets mind inspire
      and fill his soul with thy celestial fire
      relate what latium was her ancient kings
      declare the past and present state of things
      when first the trojan fleet ausonia sought
      and how the rivals lovd and how they fought
      these are my theme and how the war began
      and how concluded by the godlike man
      for i shall sing of battles blood and rage
      which princes and their people did engage
      and haughty souls that movd with mutual hate
      in fighting fields pursued and found their fate
      that rousd the tyrrhene realm with loud alarms
      and peaceful italy involvd in arms
      a larger scene of action is displayd
      and rising hence a greater work is weighd

      latinus old and mild had long possessd
      the latin scepter and his people blest
      his father faunus a laurentian dame
      his mother fair marica was her name
      but faunus came from picus picus drew
      his birth from saturn if records be true
      thus king latinus in the third degree
      had saturn author of his family
      but this old peaceful prince as heavn decreed
      was blest with no male issue to succeed
      his sons in blooming youth were snatchd by fate
      one only daughter heird the royal state
      fird with her love and with ambition led
      the neighbring princes court her nuptial bed
      among the crowd but far above the rest
      young turnus to the beauteous maid addressd
      turnus for high descent and graceful mien
      was first and favourd by the latian queen
      with him she strove to join lavinias hand
      but dire portents the purposd match withstand

      deep in the palace of long growth there stood
      a laurels trunk a venerable wood
      where rites divine were paid whose holy hair
      was kept and cut with superstitious care
      this plant latinus when his town he walld
      then found and from the tree laurentum calld
      and last in honour of his new abode
      he vowd the laurel to the laurels god
      it happend once 
      a swarm of bees that cut the liquid sky
      unknown from whence they took their airy flight
      upon the topmost branch in clouds alight
      there with their clasping feet together clung
      and a long cluster from the laurel hung
      an ancient augur prophesied from hence
      behold on latian shores a foreign prince
      from the same parts of heavn his navy stands
      to the same parts on earth his army lands
      the town he conquers and the towr commands

      yet more when fair lavinia fed the fire
      before the gods and stood beside her sire
      strange to relate the flames involvd in smoke
      of incense from the sacred altar broke
      caught her disheveld hair and rich attire
      her crown and jewels crackled in the fire
      from thence the fuming trail began to spread
      and lambent glories dancd about her head
      this new portent the seer with wonder views
      then pausing thus his prophecy renews
      the nymph who scatters flaming fires around
      shall shine with honour shall herself be crownd
      but causd by her irrevocable fate
      war shall the country waste and change the state

      latinus frighted with this dire ostent
      for counsel to his father faunus went
      and sought the shades renownd for prophecy
      which near albuneas sulphrous fountain lie
      to these the latian and the sabine land
      fly when distressd and thence relief demand
      the priest on skins of offrings takes his ease
      and nightly visions in his slumber sees
      a swarm of thin aerial shapes appears
      and fluttring round his temples deafs his ears
      these he consults the future fates to know
      from powrs above and from the fiends below
      here for the gods advice latinus flies
      offring a hundred sheep for sacrifice
      their woolly fleeces as the rites requird
      he laid beneath him and to rest retird
      no sooner were his eyes in slumber bound
      when from above a more than mortal sound
      invades his ears and thus the vision spoke
      seek not my seed in latian bands to yoke
      our fair lavinia nor the gods provoke
      a foreign son upon thy shore descends
      whose martial fame from pole to pole extends
      his race in arms and arts of peace renownd
      not latium shall contain nor europe bound
      tis theirs whateer the sun surveys around
      these answers in the silent night receivd
      the king himself divulgd the land believd
      the fame thro all the neighbring nations flew
      when now the trojan navy was in view

      beneath a shady tree the hero spread
      his table on the turf with cakes of bread
      and with his chiefs on forest fruits he fed
      they sate and 
      their homely fare dispatchd the hungry band
      invade their trenchers next and soon devour
      to mend the scanty meal their cakes of flour
      ascanius this observd and smiling said
      see we devour the plates on which we fed
      the speech had omen that the trojan race
      should find repose and this the time and place
      aeneas took the word and thus replies
      confessing fate with wonder in his eyes
      all hail o earth all hail my household gods
      behold the destind place of your abodes
      for thus anchises prophesied of old
      and this our fatal place of rest foretold
      when on a foreign shore instead of meat
      by famine forcd your trenchers you shall eat
      then ease your weary trojans will attend
      and the long labours of your voyage end
      remember on that happy coast to build
      and with a trench inclose the fruitful field
      this was that famine this the fatal place
      which ends the wandring of our exild race
      then on tomorrows dawn your care employ
      to search the land and where the cities lie
      and what the men but give this day to joy
      now pour to jove and after jove is blest
      call great anchises to the genial feast
      crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught
      enjoy the present hour adjourn the future thought

      thus having said the hero bound his brows
      with leafy branches then performd his vows
      adoring first the genius of the place
      then earth the mother of the heavnly race
      the nymphs and native godheads yet unknown
      and night and all the stars that gild her sable throne
      and ancient cybel and idaean jove
      and last his sire below and mother queen above
      then heavns high monarch thunderd thrice aloud
      and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud
      soon thro the joyful camp a rumour flew
      the time was come their city to renew
      then evry brow with cheerful green is crownd
      the feasts are doubled and the bowls go round

      when next the rosy morn disclosd the day
      the scouts to sevral parts divide their way
      to learn the natives names their towns explore
      the coasts and trendings of the crooked shore
      here tiber flows and here numicus stands
      here warlike latins hold the happy lands
      the pious chief who sought by peaceful ways
      to found his empire and his town to raise
      a hundred youths from all his train selects
      and to the latian court their course directs
      
      and all their heads with wreaths of olive hides
      they go commissiond to require a peace
      and carry presents to procure access
      thus while they speed their pace the prince designs
      his newelected seat and draws the lines
      the trojans round the place a rampire cast
      and palisades about the trenches placd

      meantime the train proceeding on their way
      from far the town and lofty towrs survey
      at length approach the walls without the gate
      they see the boys and latian youth debate
      the martial prizes on the dusty plain
      some drive the cars and some the coursers rein
      some bend the stubborn bow for victory
      and some with darts their active sinews try
      a posting messenger dispatchd from hence
      of this fair troop advisd their aged prince
      that foreign men of mighty stature came
      uncouth their habit and unknown their name
      the king ordains their entrance and ascends
      his regal seat surrounded by his friends

      the palace built by picus vast and proud
      supported by a hundred pillars stood
      and round incompassd with a rising wood
      the pile oerlookd the town and drew the sight
      surprisd at once with reverence and delight
      there kings receivd the marks of sovreign powr
      in state the monarchs marchd the lictors bore
      their awful axes and the rods before
      here the tribunal stood the house of prayr
      and here the sacred senators repair
      all at large tables in long order set
      a ram their offring and a ram their meat
      above the portal carvd in cedar wood
      placd in their ranks their godlike grandsires stood
      old saturn with his crooked scythe on high
      and italus that led the colony
      and ancient janus with his double face
      and bunch of keys the porter of the place
      there good sabinus planter of the vines
      on a short pruning hook his head reclines
      and studiously surveys his genrous wines
      then warlike kings who for their country fought
      and honourable wounds from battle brought
      around the posts hung helmets darts and spears
      and captive chariots axes shields and bars
      and broken beaks of ships the trophies of their wars
      above the rest as chief of all the band
      was picus placd a buckler in his hand
      his other wavd a long divining wand
      girt in his gabin gown the hero sate
      yet could not with his art avoid his fate
      for circe long had lovd the youth in vain
      till love refusd converted to disdain
      then mixing powrful herbs with magic art
      she changd his form who could not change his heart
      constraind him in a bird and made him fly
      with partycolourd plumes a chattring pie

      in this high temple on a chair of state
      the seat of audience old latinus sate
      then gave admission to the trojan train
      and thus with pleasing accents he began
      tell me ye trojans for that name you own
      nor is your course upon our coasts unknown
      say what you seek and whither were you bound
      were you by stress of weather cast aground
      such dangers as on seas are often seen
      and oft befall to miserable men
      or come your shipping in our ports to lay
      spent and disabled in so long a way
      say what you want the latians you shall find
      not forcd to goodness but by will inclind
      for since the time of saturns holy reign
      his hospitable customs we retain
      i call to mind 
      th arunci told that dardanus tho born
      on latian plains yet sought the phrygian shore
      and samothracia samos calld before
      from tuscan coritum he claimd his birth
      but after when exempt from mortal earth
      from thence ascended to his kindred skies
      a god and as a god augments their sacrifice

      he said ilioneus made this reply
      o king of faunus royal family
      nor wintry winds to latium forcd our way
      nor did the stars our wandring course betray
      willing we sought your shores and hither bound
      the port so long desird at length we found
      from our sweet homes and ancient realms expelld
      great as the greatest that the sun beheld
      the god began our line who rules above
      and as our race our king descends from jove
      and hither are we come by his command
      to crave admission in your happy land
      how dire a tempest from mycenae pourd
      our plains our temples and our town devourd
      what was the waste of war what fierce alarms
      shook asias crown with european arms
      evn such have heard if any such there be
      whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea
      and such as born beneath the burning sky
      and sultry sun betwixt the tropics lie
      from that dire deluge thro the watry waste
      such length of years such various perils past
      at last escapd to latium we repair
      to beg what you without your want may spare
      the common water and the common air
      sheds which ourselves will build and mean abodes
      fit to receive and serve our banishd gods
      nor our admission shall your realm disgrace
      nor length of time our gratitude efface
      besides what endless honour you shall gain
      to save and shelter troys unhappy train
      now by my sovreign and his fate i swear
      renownd for faith in peace for force in war
      oft our alliance other lands desird
      and what we seek of you of us requird
      despite not then that in our hands we bear
      these holy boughs and sue with words of prayr
      fate and the gods by their supreme command
      have doomd our ships to seek the latian land
      to these abodes our fleet apollo sends
      here dardanus was born and hither tends
      where tuscan tiber rolls with rapid force
      and where numicus opes his holy source
      besides our prince presents with his request
      some small remains of what his sire possessd
      this golden charger snatchd from burning troy
      anchises did in sacrifice employ
      this royal robe and this tiara wore
      old priam and this golden scepter bore
      in full assemblies and in solemn games
      these purple vests were weavd by dardan dames

      thus while he spoke latinus rolld around
      his eyes and fixd a while upon the ground
      intent he seemd and anxious in his breast
      not by the scepter movd or kingly vest
      but pondring future things of wondrous weight
      succession empire and his daughters fate
      on these he musd within his thoughtful mind
      and then revolvd what faunus had divind
      this was the foreign prince by fate decreed
      to share his scepter and lavinias bed
      this was the race that sure portents foreshew
      to sway the world and land and sea subdue
      at length he raisd his cheerful head and spoke
      the powrs said he the powrs we both invoke
      to you and yours and mine propitious be
      and firm our purpose with their augury
      have what you ask your presents i receive
      land where and when you please with ample leave
      partake and use my kingdom as your own
      all shall be yours while i command the crown
      and if my wishd alliance please your king
      tell him he should not send the peace but bring
      then let him not a friends embraces fear
      the peace is made when i behold him here
      besides this answer tell my royal guest
      i add to his commands my own request
      one only daughter heirs my crown and state
      whom not our oracles nor heavn nor fate
      nor frequent prodigies permit to join
      with any native of th ausonian line
      a foreign soninlaw shall come from far
       a chief renownd in war
      whose race shall bear aloft the latian name
      and thro the conquerd world diffuse our fame
      himself to be the man the fates require
      i firmly judge and what i judge desire

      he said and then on each bestowd a steed
      three hundred horses in high stables fed
      stood ready shining all and smoothly dressd
      of these he chose the fairest and the best
      to mount the trojan troop at his command
      the steeds caparisond with purple stand
      with golden trappings glorious to behold
      and champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold
      then to his absent guest the king decreed
      a pair of coursers born of heavnly breed
      who from their nostrils breathd ethereal fire
      whom circe stole from her celestial sire
      by substituting mares producd on earth
      whose wombs conceivd a more than mortal birth
      these draw the chariot which latinus sends
      and the rich present to the prince commends
      sublime on stately steeds the trojans borne
      to their expecting lord with peace return

      but jealous juno from pachynus height
      as she from argos took her airy flight
      beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight
      she saw the trojan and his joyful train
      descend upon the shore desert the main
      design a town and with unhopd success
      th embassadors return with promisd peace
      then piercd with pain she shook her haughty head
      sighd from her inward soul and thus she said
      o hated offspring of my phrygian foes
      o fates of troy which junos fates oppose
      could they not fall unpitied on the plain
      but slain revive and taken scape again
      when execrable troy in ashes lay
      thro fires and swords and seas they forcd their way
      then vanquishd juno must in vain contend
      her rage disarmd her empire at an end
      breathless and tird is all my fury spent
      or does my glutted spleen at length relent
      as if twere little from their town to chase
      i thro the seas pursued their exild race
      ingagd the heavns opposd the stormy main
      but billows roard and tempests ragd in vain
      what have my scyllas and my syrtes done
      when these they overpass and those they shun
      on tibers shores they land secure of fate
      triumphant oer the storms and junos hate
      mars could in mutual blood the centaurs bathe
      and jove himself gave way to cynthias wrath
      who sent the tusky boar to calydon
      what great offence had either people done
      but i the consort of the thunderer
      have wagd a long and unsuccessful war
      with various arts and arms in vain have toild
      and by a mortal man at length am foild
      if native powr prevail not shall i doubt
      to seek for needful succour from without
      if jove and heavn my just desires deny
      hell shall the powr of heavn and jove supply
      grant that the fates have firmd by their decree
      the trojan race to reign in italy
      at least i can defer the nuptial day
      and with protracted wars the peace delay
      with blood the dear alliance shall be bought
      and both the people near destruction brought
      so shall the soninlaw and father join
      with ruin war and waste of either line
      o fatal maid thy marriage is endowd
      with phrygian latian and rutulian blood
      bellona leads thee to thy lovers hand
      another queen brings forth another brand
      to burn with foreign fires another land
      a second paris diffring but in name
      shall fire his country with a second flame

      thus having said she sinks beneath the ground
      with furious haste and shoots the stygian sound
      to rouse alecto from th infernal seat
      of her dire sisters and their dark retreat
      this fury fit for her intent she chose
      one who delights in wars and human woes
      evn pluto hates his own misshapen race
      her sister furies fly her hideous face
      so frightful are the forms the monster takes
      so fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes
      her juno finds and thus inflames her spite
      o virgin daughter of eternal night
      give me this once thy labour to sustain
      my right and execute my just disdain
      let not the trojans with a feignd pretence
      of profferd peace delude the latian prince
      expel from italy that odious name
      and let not juno suffer in her fame
      tis thine to ruin realms oerturn a state
      betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate
      and kindle kindred blood to mutual hate
      thy hand oer towns the funral torch displays
      and forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways
      now shake out thy fruitful breast the seeds
      of envy discord and of cruel deeds
      confound the peace establishd and prepare
      their souls to hatred and their hands to war

      smeard as she was with black gorgonian blood
      the fury sprang above the stygian flood
      and on her wicker wings sublime thro night
      she to the latian palace took her flight
      there sought the queens apartment stood before
      the peaceful threshold and besiegd the door
      restless amata lay her swelling breast
      fird with disdain for turnus dispossessd
      and the new nuptials of the trojan guest
      from her black bloody locks the fury shakes
      her darling plague the favrite of her snakes
      with her full force she threw the poisonous dart
      and fixd it deep within amatas heart
      that thus envenomd she might kindle rage
      and sacrifice to strife her house and husbands age
      unseen unfelt the fiery serpent skims
      betwixt her linen and her naked limbs
      his baleful breath inspiring as he glides
      now like a chain around her neck he rides
      now like a fillet to her head repairs
      and with his circling volumes folds her hairs
      at first the silent venom slid with ease
      and seizd her cooler senses by degrees
      then ere th infected mass was fird too far
      in plaintive accents she began the war
      and thus bespoke her husband shall she said
      a wandring prince enjoy lavinias bed
      if nature plead not in a parents heart
      pity my tears and pity her desert
      i know my dearest lord the time will come
      youd in vain reverse your cruel doom
      the faithless pirate soon will set to sea
      and bear the royal virgin far away
      a guest like him a trojan guest before
      in shew of friendship sought the spartan shore
      and ravishd helen from her husband bore
      think on a kings inviolable word
      and think on turnus her once plighted lord
      to this false foreigner you give your throne
      and wrong a friend a kinsman and a son
      resume your ancient care and if the god
      your sire and you resolve on foreign blood
      know all are foreign in a larger sense
      not born your subjects or derivd from hence
      then if the line of turnus you retrace
      he springs from inachus of argive race

      but when she saw her reasons idly spent
      and could not move him from his fixd intent
      she flew to rage for now the snake possessd
      her vital parts and poisond all her breast
      she raves she runs with a distracted pace
      and fills with horrid howls the public place
      and as young striplings whip the top for sport
      on the smooth pavement of an empty court
      the wooden engine flies and whirls about
      admird with clamours of the beardless rout
      they lash aloud each other they provoke
      and lend their little souls at evry stroke
      thus fares the queen and thus her fury blows
      amidst the crowd and kindles as she goes
      nor yet content she strains her malice more
      and adds new ills to those contrivd before
      she flies the town and mixing with a throng
      of madding matrons bears the bride along
      wandring thro woods and wilds and devious ways
      and with these arts the trojan match delays
      she feignd the rites of bacchus cried aloud
      and to the buxom god the virgin vowd
      evoe o bacchus thus began the song
      and evoe answerd all the female throng
      o virgin worthy thee alone she cried
      o worthy thee alone the crew replied
      for thee she feeds her hair she leads thy dance
      and with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance
      like fury seizd the rest the progress known
      all seek the mountains and forsake the town
      all clad in skins of beasts the javlin bear
      give to the wanton winds their flowing hair
      and shrieks and shoutings rend the suffring air
      the queen herself inspird with rage divine
      shook high above her head a flaming pine
      then rolld her haggard eyes around the throng
      and sung in turnus name the nuptial song
      io ye latian dames if any here
      hold your unhappy queen amata dear
      if there be here she said who dare maintain
      my right nor think the name of mother vain
      unbind your fillets loose your flowing hair
      and orgies and nocturnal rites prepare

      amatas breast the fury thus invades
      and fires with rage amid the sylvan shades
      then when she found her venom spread so far
      the royal house embroild in civil war
      raisd on her dusky wings she cleaves the skies
      and seeks the palace where young turnus lies
      his town as fame reports was built of old
      by danae pregnant with almighty gold
      who fled her fathers rage and with a train
      of following argives thro the stormy main
      drivn by the southern blasts was fated here to reign
      twas ardua once now ardeas name it bears
      once a fair city now consumd with years
      here in his lofty palace turnus lay
      betwixt the confines of the night and day
      secure in sleep the fury laid aside
      her looks and limbs and with new methods tried
      the foulness of th infernal form to hide
      proppd on a staff she takes a trembling mien
      her face is furrowd and her front obscene
      deepdinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws
      sunk are her eyes and toothless are her jaws
      her hoary hair with holy fillets bound
      her temples with an olive wreath are crownd
      old chalybe who kept the sacred fane
      of juno now she seemd and thus began
      appearing in a dream to rouse the careless man
      shall turnus then such endless toil sustain
      in fighting fields and conquer towns in vain
      win for a trojan head to wear the prize
      usurp thy crown enjoy thy victories
      the bride and scepter which thy blood has bought
      the king transfers and foreign heirs are sought
      go now deluded man and seek again
      new toils new dangers on the dusty plain
      repel the tuscan foes their city seize
      protect the latians in luxurious ease
      this dream allpowrful juno sends i bear
      her mighty mandates and her words you hear
      haste arm your ardeans issue to the plain
      with fate to friend assault the trojan train
      their thoughtless chiefs their painted ships that lie
      in tibers mouth with fire and sword destroy
      the latian king unless he shall submit
      own his old promise and his new forget
      let him in arms the powr of turnus prove
      and learn to fear whom he disdains to love
      for such is heavns command the youthful prince
      with scorn replied and made this bold defence
      you tell me mother what i knew before
      the phrygian fleet is landed on the shore
      i neither fear nor will provoke the war
      my fate is junos most peculiar care
      but time has made you dote and vainly tell
      of arms imagind in your lonely cell
      go be the temple and the gods your care
      permit to men the thought of peace and war

      these haughty words alectos rage provoke
      and frighted turnus trembled as she spoke
      her eyes grow stiffend and with sulphur burn
      her hideous looks and hellish form return
      her curling snakes with hissings fill the place
      and open all the furies of her face
      then darting fire from her malignant eyes
      she cast him backward as he strove to rise
      and lingring sought to frame some new replies
      high on her head she rears two twisted snakes
      her chains she rattles and her whip she shakes
      and churning bloody foam thus loudly speaks
      behold whom time has made to dote and tell
      of arms imagind in her lonely cell
      behold the fates infernal minister
      war death destruction in my hand i bear

      thus having said her smouldring torch impressd
      with her full force she plungd into his breast
      aghast he wakd and starting from his bed
      cold sweat in clammy drops his limbs oerspread
      arms arms he cries my sword and shield prepare
      he breathes defiance blood and mortal war
      so when with crackling flames a caldron fries
      the bubbling waters from the bottom rise
      above the brims they force their fiery way
      black vapours climb aloft and cloud the day

      the peace polluted thus a chosen band
      he first commissions to the latian land
      in threatning embassy then raisd the rest
      to meet in arms th intruding trojan guest
      to force the foes from the lavinian shore
      and italys indangerd peace restore
      himself alone an equal match he boasts
      to fight the phrygian and ausonian hosts
      the gods invokd the rutuli prepare
      their arms and warn each other to the war
      his beauty these and those his blooming age
      the rest his house and his own fame engage

      while turnus urges thus his enterprise
      the stygian fury to the trojans flies
      new frauds invents and takes a steepy stand
      which overlooks the vale with wide command
      where fair ascanius and his youthful train
      with horns and hounds a hunting match ordain
      and pitch their toils around the shady plain
      the fury fires the pack they snuff they vent
      and feed their hungry nostrils with the scent
      twas of a wellgrown stag whose antlers rise
      high oer his front his beams invade the skies
      from this light cause th infernal maid prepares
      the country churls to mischief hate and wars

      the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred
      snatchd from his dams and the tame youngling fed
      their father tyrrheus did his fodder bring
      tyrrheus chief ranger to the latian king
      their sister silvia cherishd with her care
      the little wanton and did wreaths prepare
      to hang his budding horns with ribbons tied
      his tender neck and combd his silken hide
      and bathed his body patient of command
      in time he grew and growing usd to hand
      he waited at his masters board for food
      then sought his salvage kindred in the wood
      where grazing all the day at night he came
      to his known lodgings and his country dame

      this household beast that usd the woodland grounds
      was viewd at first by the young heros hounds
      as down the stream he swam to seek retreat
      in the cool waters and to quench his heat
      ascanius young and eager of his game
      soon bent his bow uncertain in his aim
      but the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides
      which piercd his bowels thro his panting sides
      the bleeding creature issues from the floods
      possessd with fear and seeks his known abodes
      his old familiar hearth and household gods
      he falls he fills the house with heavy groans
      implores their pity and his pain bemoans
      young silvia beats her breast and cries aloud
      for succour from the clownish neighbourhood
      the churls assemble for the fiend who lay
      in the close woody covert urgd their way
      one with a brand yet burning from the flame
      armd with a knotty club another came
      whateer they catch or find without their care
      their fury makes an instrument of war
      tyrrheus the foster father of the beast
      then clenchd a hatchet in his horny fist
      but held his hand from the descending stroke
      and left his wedge within the cloven oak
      to whet their courage and their rage provoke
      and now the goddess exercisd in ill
      who watchd an hour to work her impious will
      ascends the roof and to her crooked horn
      such as was then by latian shepherds borne
      adds all her breath the rocks and woods around
      and mountains tremble at th infernal sound
      the sacred lake of trivia from afar
      the veline fountains and sulphureous nar
      shake at the baleful blast the signal of the war
      young mothers wildly stare with fear possessd
      and strain their helpless infants to their breast

      the clowns a boistrous rude ungovernd crew
      with furious haste to the loud summons flew
      the powrs of troy then issuing on the plain
      with fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain
      not theirs a raw and unexperiencd train
      but a firm body of embattled men
      at first while fortune favourd neither side
      the fight with clubs and burning brands was tried
      but now both parties reinforcd the fields
      are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields
      a shining harvest either host displays
      and shoots against the sun with equal rays
      thus when a blackbrowd gust begins to rise
      white foam at first on the curld ocean fries
      then roars the main the billows mount the skies
      till by the fury of the storm full blown
      the muddy bottom oer the clouds is thrown
      first almon falls old tyrrheus eldest care
      piercd with an arrow from the distant war
      fixd in his throat the flying weapon stood
      and stoppd his breath and drank his vital blood
      huge heaps of slain around the body rise
      among the rest the rich galesus lies
      a good old man while peace he preachd in vain
      amidst the madness of th unruly train
      five herds five bleating flocks his pastures filld
      his lands a hundred yoke of oxen tilld

      thus while in equal scales their fortune stood
      the fury bathd them in each others blood
      then having fixd the fight exulting flies
      and bears fulfilld her promise to the skies
      to juno thus she speaks behold it is done
      the blood already drawn the war begun
      the discord is complete nor can they cease
      the dire debate nor you command the peace
      now since the latian and the trojan brood
      have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood
      speak and my powr shall add this office more
      the neighbring nations of th ausonian shore
      shall hear the dreadful rumour from afar
      of armd invasion and embrace the war
      then juno thus the grateful work is done
      the seeds of discord sowd the war begun
      frauds fears and fury have possessd the state
      and fixd the causes of a lasting hate
      a bloody hymen shall th alliance join
      betwixt the trojan and ausonian line
      but thou with speed to night and hell repair
      for not the gods nor angry jove will bear
      thy lawless wandring walks in upper air
      leave what remains to me saturnia said
      the sullen fiend her sounding wings displayd
      unwilling left the light and sought the nether shade

      in midst of italy well known to fame
      there lies a lake amsanctus is the name
      below the lofty mounts on either side
      thick forests the forbidden entrance hide
      full in the centre of the sacred wood
      an arm arises of the stygian flood
      which breaking from beneath with bellowing sound
      whirls the black waves and rattling stones around
      here pluto pants for breath from out his cell
      and opens wide the grinning jaws of hell
      to this infernal lake the fury flies
      here hides her hated head and frees the labring skies

      saturnian juno now with double care
      attends the fatal process of the war
      the clowns returnd from battle bear the slain
      implore the gods and to their king complain
      the corps of almon and the rest are shown
      shrieks clamours murmurs fill the frighted town
      ambitious turnus in the press appears
      and aggravating crimes augments their fears
      proclaims his private injuries aloud
      a solemn promise made and disavowd
      a foreign son is sought and a mixd mungril brood
      then they whose mothers frantic with their fear
      in woods and wilds the flags of bacchus bear
      and lead his dances with disheveld hair
      increase the clamour and the war demand
      
      against the public sanctions of the peace
      against all omens of their ill success
      with fates averse the rout in arms resort
      to force their monarch and insult the court
      but like a rock unmovd a rock that braves
      the raging tempest and the rising waves
      proppd on himself he stands his solid sides
      wash off the seaweeds and the sounding tides
      so stood the pious prince unmovd and long
      sustaind the madness of the noisy throng
      but when he found that junos powr prevaild
      and all the methods of cool counsel faild
      he calls the gods to witness their offence
      disclaims the war asserts his innocence
      hurried by fate he cries and borne before
      a furious wind we have the faithful shore
      o more than madmen you yourselves shall bear
      the guilt of blood and sacrilegious war
      thou turnus shalt atone it by thy fate
      and pray to heavn for peace but pray too late
      for me my stormy voyage at an end
      i to the port of death securely tend
      the funral pomp which to your kings you pay
      is all i want and all you take away
      he said no more but in his walls confind
      shut out the woes which he too well divind
      nor with the rising storm would vainly strive
      but left the helm and let the vessel drive

      a solemn custom was observd of old
      which latium held and now the romans hold
      their standard when in fighting fields they rear
      against the fierce hyrcanians or declare
      the scythian indian or arabian war
      or from the boasting parthians would regain
      their eagles lost in carrhaes bloody plain
      two gates of steel 
      before his temple stand the dire abode
      and the feard issues of the furious god
      are fencd with brazen bolts without the gates
      the wary guardian janus doubly waits
      then when the sacred senate votes the wars
      the roman consul their decree declares
      and in his robes the sounding gates unbars
      the youth in military shouts arise
      and the loud trumpets break the yielding skies
      these rites of old by sovreign princes usd
      were the kings office but the king refusd
      deaf to their cries nor would the gates unbar
      of sacred peace or loose th imprisond war
      but hid his head and safe from loud alarms
      abhorrd the wicked ministry of arms
      then heavns imperious queen shot down from high
      at her approach the brazen hinges fly
      the gates are forcd and evry falling bar
      and like a tempest issues out the war

      the peaceful cities of th ausonian shore
      lulld in their ease and undisturbd before
      are all on fire and some with studious care
      their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare
      some their soft limbs in painful marches try
      and war is all their wish and arms the genral cry
      part scour the rusty shields with seam and part
      new grind the blunted ax and point the dart
      with joy they view the waving ensigns fly
      and hear the trumpets clangour pierce the sky
      five cities forge their arms th atinian powrs
      antemnae tibur with her lofty towrs
      ardea the proud the crustumerian town
      all these of old were places of renown
      some hammer helmets for the fighting field
      some twine young sallows to support the shield
      the croslet some and some the cuishes mould
      with silver plated and with ductile gold
      the rustic honours of the scythe and share
      give place to swords and plumes the pride of war
      old falchions are new temperd in the fires
      the sounding trumpet evry soul inspires
      the word is givn with eager speed they lace
      the shining headpiece and the shield embrace
      the neighing steeds are to the chariot tied
      the trusty weapon sits on evry side

      and now the mighty labour is begun
      ye muses open all your helicon
      sing you the chiefs that swayd th ausonian land
      their arms and armies under their command
      what warriors in our ancient clime were bred
      what soldiers followd and what heroes led
      for well you know and can record alone
      what fame to future times conveys but darkly down
      mezentius first appeard upon the plain
      scorn sate upon his brows and sour disdain
      defying earth and heavn etruria lost
      he brings to turnus aid his baffled host
      the charming lausus full of youthful fire
      rode in the rank and next his sullen sire
      to turnus only second in the grace
      of manly mien and features of the face
      a skilful horseman and a huntsman bred
      with fates averse a thousand men he led
      his sire unworthy of so brave a son
      himself well worthy of a happier throne

      next aventinus drives his chariot round
      the latian plains with palms and laurels crownd
      proud of his steeds he smokes along the field
      his fathers hydra fills his ample shield
      a hundred serpents hiss about the brims
      the son of hercules he justly seems
      by his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs
      of heavnly part and part of earthly blood
      a mortal woman mixing with a god
      for strong alcides after he had slain
      the triple geryon drove from conquerd spain
      his captive herds and thence in triumph led
      on tuscan tibers flowry banks they fed
      then on mount aventine the son of jove
      the priestess rhea found and forcd to love
      for arms his men long piles and javlins bore
      and poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore
      like hercules himself his son appears
      in salvage pomp a lions hide he wears
      about his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin
      the teeth and gaping jaws severely grin
      thus like the god his father homely dressd
      he strides into the hall a horrid guest

      then two twin brothers from fair tibur came
      
      fierce coras and catillus void of fear
      armd argive horse they led and in the front appear
      like cloudborn centaurs from the mountains height
      with rapid course descending to the fight
      they rush along the rattling woods give way
      the branches bend before their sweepy sway

      nor was praenestes founder wanting there
      whom fame reports the son of mulciber
      found in the fire and fosterd in the plains
      a shepherd and a king at once he reigns
      and leads to turnus aid his country swains
      his own praeneste sends a chosen band
      with those who plow saturnias gabine land
      besides the succour which cold anien yields
      the rocks of hernicus and dewy fields
      anagnia fat and father amasene
      a numrous rout but all of naked men
      nor arms they wear nor swords and bucklers wield
      nor drive the chariot thro the dusty field
      but whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead
      and spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head
      the left foot naked when they march to fight
      but in a bulls raw hide they sheathe the right
      messapus next 
      secure of steel and fated from the fire
      in pomp appears and with his ardour warms
      a heartless train unexercisd in arms
      the just faliscans he to battle brings
      and those who live where lake ciminius springs
      and where feronias grove and temple stands
      who till fescennian or flavinian lands
      all these in order march and marching sing
      the warlike actions of their seaborn king
      like a long team of snowy swans on high
      which clap their wings and cleave the liquid sky
      when homeward from their watry pastures borne
      they sing and asias lakes their notes return
      not one who heard their music from afar
      would think these troops an army traind to war
      but flocks of fowl that when the tempests roar
      with their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore

      then clausus came who led a numrous band
      of troops embodied from the sabine land
      and in himself alone an army brought
      twas he the noble claudian race begot
      the claudian race ordaind in times to come
      to share the greatness of imperial rome
      he led the cures forth of old renown
      mutuscans from their olivebearing town
      and all th eretian powrs besides a band
      that followd from velinums dewy land
      and amiternian troops of mighty fame
      and mountaineers that from severus came
      and from the craggy cliffs of tetrica
      and those where yellow tiber takes his way
      and where himellas wanton waters play
      casperia sends her arms with those that lie
      by fabaris and fruitful foruli
      the warlike aids of horta next appear
      and the cold nursians come to close the rear
      mixd with the natives born of latine blood
      whom allia washes with her fatal flood
      not thicker billows beat the libyan main
      when pale orion sets in wintry rain
      nor thicker harvests on rich hermus rise
      or lycian fields when phoebus burns the skies
      than stand these troops their bucklers ring around
      their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground

      high in his chariot then halesus came
      a foe by birth to troys unhappy name
      from agamemnon bornto turnus aid
      a thousand men the youthful hero led
      who till the massic soil for wine renownd
      and fierce auruncans from their hilly ground
      and those who live by sidicinian shores
      and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars
      cales and oscas old inhabitants
      and rough saticulans inurd to wants
      light demilances from afar they throw
      fastend with leathern thongs to gall the foe
      short crooked swords in closer fight they wear
      and on their warding arm light bucklers bear

      nor oebalus shalt thou be left unsung
      from nymph semethis and old telon sprung
      who then in teleboan capri reignd
      but that short isle th ambitious youth disdaind
      and oer campania stretchd his ample sway
      where swelling sarnus seeks the tyrrhene sea
      oer batulum and where abella sees
      from her high towrs the harvest of her trees
      and these 
      wield brazen swords and brazen bucklers hold
      sling weighty stones when from afar they fight
      their casques are cork a covering thick and light

      next these in rank the warlike ufens went
      and led the mountain troops that nursia sent
      the rude equicolae his rule obeyd
      hunting their sport and plundring was their trade
      in arms they plowd to battle still prepard
      their soil was barren and their hearts were hard

      umbro the priest the proud marrubians led
      by king archippus sent to turnus aid
      and peaceful olives crownd his hoary head
      his wand and holy words the vipers rage
      and venomd wounds of serpents could assuage
      he when he pleasd with powerful juice to steep
      their temples shut their eyes in pleasing sleep
      but vain were marsian herbs and magic art
      to cure the wound givn by the dardan dart
      yet his untimely fate th angitian woods
      in sighs remurmurd to the fucine floods

      the son of famd hippolytus was there
      famd as his sire and as his mother fair
      whom in egerian groves aricia bore
      and nursd his youth along the marshy shore
      where great dianas peaceful altars flame
      in fruitful fields and virbius was his name
      hippolytus as old records have said
      was by his stepdam sought to share her bed
      but when no female arts his mind could move
      she turnd to furious hate her impious love
      torn by wild horses on the sandy shore
      anothers crimes th unhappy hunter bore
      glutting his fathers eyes with guiltless gore
      but chaste diana who his death deplord
      with aesculapian herbs his life restord
      then jove who saw from high with just disdain
      the dead inspird with vital breath again
      struck to the centre with his flaming dart
      th unhappy founder of the godlike art
      but trivia kept in secret shades alone
      her care hippolytus to fate unknown
      and calld him virbius in th egerian grove
      where then he livd obscure but safe from jove
      for this from trivias temple and her wood
      are coursers drivn who shed their masters blood
      affrighted by the monsters of the flood
      his son the second virbius yet retaind
      his fathers art and warrior steeds he reind

      amid the troops and like the leading god
      high oer the rest in arms the graceful turnus rode
      a triple of plumes his crest adornd
      on which with belching flames chimaera burnd
      the more the kindled combat rises highr
      the more with fury burns the blazing fire
      fair io gracd his shield but io now
      with horns exalted stands and seems to low
      a noble charge her keeper by her side
      to watch her walks his hundred eyes applied
      and on the brims her sire the watry god
      rolld from a silver urn his crystal flood
      a cloud of foot succeeds and fills the fields
      with swords and pointed spears and clattring shields
      of argives and of old sicanian bands
      and those who plow the rich rutulian lands
      auruncan youth and those sacrana yields
      and the proud labicans with painted shields
      and those who near numician streams reside
      and those whom tibers holy forests hide
      or circes hills from the main land divide
      where ufens glides along the lowly lands
      or the black water of pomptina stands

      last from the volscians fair camilla came
      and led her warlike troops a warrior dame
      unbred to spinning in the loom unskilld
      she chose the nobler pallas of the field
      mixd with the first the fierce virago fought
      sustaind the toils of arms the danger sought
      outstrippd the winds in speed upon the plain
      flew oer the fields nor hurt the bearded grain
      she swept the seas and as she skimmd along
      her flying feet unbathd on billows hung
      men boys and women stupid with surprise
      whereer she passes fix their wondring eyes
      longing they look and gaping at the sight
      devour her oer and oer with vast delight
      her purple habit sits with such a grace
      on her smooth shoulders and so suits her face
      her head with ringlets of her hair is crownd
      and in a golden caul the curls are bound
      she shakes her myrtle javlin and behind
      her lycian quiver dances in the wind




      when turnus had assembled all his powrs
      his standard planted on laurentums towrs
      when now the sprightly trumpet from afar
      had givn the signal of approaching war
      had rousd the neighing steeds to scour the fields
      while the fierce riders clatterd on their shields
      trembling with rage the latian youth prepare
      to join th allies and headlong rush to war
      fierce ufens and messapus led the crowd
      with bold mezentius who blasphemd aloud
      these thro the country took their wasteful course
      the fields to forage and to gather force
      then venulus to diomede they send
      to beg his aid ausonia to defend
      declare the common danger and inform
      the grecian leader of the growing storm
      aeneas landed on the latian coast
      with banishd gods and with a baffled host
      yet now aspird to conquest of the state
      and claimd a title from the gods and fate
      what numrous nations in his quarrel came
      and how they spread his formidable name
      what he designd what mischief might arise
      if fortune favourd his first enterprise
      was left for him to weigh whose equal fears
      and common interest was involvd in theirs

      while turnus and th allies thus urge the war
      the trojan floating in a flood of care
      beholds the tempest which his foes prepare
      this way and that he turns his anxious mind
      thinks and rejects the counsels he designd
      explores himself in vain in evry part
      and gives no rest to his distracted heart
      so when the sun by day or moon by night
      strike on the polishd brass their trembling light
      the glittring species here and there divide
      and cast their dubious beams from side to side
      now on the walls now on the pavement play
      and to the ceiling flash the glaring day

      twas night and weary nature lulld asleep
      the birds of air and fishes of the deep
      and beasts and mortal men the trojan chief
      was laid on tibers banks oppressd with grief
      and found in silent slumber late relief
      then thro the shadows of the poplar wood
      arose the father of the roman flood
      an azure robe was oer his body spread
      a wreath of shady reeds adornd his head
      thus manifest to sight the god appeard
      and with these pleasing words his sorrow cheerd
      undoubted offspring of ethereal race
      o long expected in this promisd place
      who thro the foes hast borne thy banishd gods
      restord them to their hearths and old abodes
      this is thy happy home the clime where fate
      ordains thee to restore the trojan state
      fear not the war shall end in lasting peace
      and all the rage of haughty juno cease
      and that this nightly vision may not seem
      th effect of fancy or an idle dream
      a sow beneath an oak shall lie along
      all white herself and white her thirty young
      when thirty rolling years have run their race
      thy son ascanius on this empty space
      shall build a royal town of lasting fame
      which from this omen shall receive the name
      time shall approve the truth for what remains
      and how with sure success to crown thy pains
      with patience next attend a banishd band
      drivn with evander from th arcadian land
      have planted here and placd on high their walls
      their town the founder pallanteum calls
      derivd from pallas his greatgrandsires name
      but the fierce latians old possession claim
      with war infesting the new colony
      these make thy friends and on their aid rely
      to thy free passage i submit my streams
      wake son of venus from thy pleasing dreams
      and when the setting stars are lost in day
      to junos powr thy just devotion pay
      with sacrifice the wrathful queen appease
      her pride at length shall fall her fury cease
      when thou returnst victorious from the war
      perform thy vows to me with grateful care
      the god am i whose yellow water flows
      around these fields and fattens as it goes
      tiber my name among the rolling floods
      renownd on earth esteemd among the gods
      this is my certain seat in times to come
      my waves shall wash the walls of mighty rome

      he said and plungd below while yet he spoke
      his dream aeneas and his sleep forsook
      he rose and looking up beheld the skies
      with purple blushing and the day arise
      then water in his hollow palm he took
      from tibers flood and thus the powrs bespoke
      laurentian nymphs by whom the streams are fed
      and father tiber in thy sacred bed
      receive aeneas and from danger keep
      whatever fount whatever holy deep
      conceals thy watry stores whereer they rise
      and bubbling from below salute the skies
      thou king of horned floods whose plenteous urn
      suffices fatness to the fruitful corn
      for this thy kind compassion of our woes
      shalt share my morning song and evning vows
      but o be present to thy peoples aid
      and firm the gracious promise thou hast made
      thus having said two galleys from his stores
      with care he chooses mans and fits with oars
      now on the shore the fatal swine is found
      wondrous to tellshe lay along the ground
      her wellfed offspring at her udders hung
      she white herself and white her thirty young
      aeneas takes the mother and her brood
      and all on junos altar are bestowd

      the follwing night and the succeeding day
      propitious tiber smoothd his watry way
      he rolld his river back and poisd he stood
      a gentle swelling and a peaceful flood
      the trojans mount their ships they put from shore
      borne on the waves and scarcely dip an oar
      shouts from the land give omen to their course
      and the pitchd vessels glide with easy force
      the woods and waters wonder at the gleam
      of shields and painted ships that stem the stream
      one summers night and one whole day they pass
      betwixt the greenwood shades and cut the liquid glass
      the fiery sun had finishd half his race
      lookd back and doubted in the middle space
      when they from far beheld the rising towrs
      the tops of sheds and shepherds lowly bowrs
      thin as they stood which then of homely clay
      now rise in marble from the roman sway
      these cots 
      the trojan saw and turnd his ships to shore
      twas on a solemn day th arcadian states
      the king and prince without the city gates
      then paid their offrings in a sacred grove
      to hercules the warrior son of jove
      thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies
      and fat of entrails on his altar fries

      but when they saw the ships that stemmd the flood
      and glitterd thro the covert of the wood
      they rose with fear and left th unfinishd feast
      till dauntless pallas reassurd the rest
      to pay the rites himself without delay
      a javlin seizd and singly took his way
      then gaind a rising ground and calld from far
      resolve me strangers whence and what you are
      your busness here and bring you peace or war
      high on the stern aeneas took his stand
      and held a branch of olive in his hand
      while thus he spoke the phrygians arms you see
      expelld from troy provokd in italy
      by latian foes with war unjustly made
      at first affiancd and at last betrayd
      this message bear the trojans and their chief
      bring holy peace and beg the kings relief
      struck with so great a name and all on fire
      the youth replies whatever you require
      your fame exacts upon our shores descend
      a welcome guest and what you wish a friend
      he said and downward hasting to the strand
      embracd the stranger prince and joind his hand

      conducted to the grove aeneas broke
      the silence first and thus the king bespoke
      best of the greeks to whom by fates command
      i bear these peaceful branches in my hand
      undaunted i approach you tho i know
      your birth is grecian and your land my foe
      from atreus tho your ancient lineage came
      and both the brother kings your kindred claim
      yet my selfconscious worth your high renown
      your virtue thro the neighbring nations blown
      our fathers mingled blood apollos voice
      have led me hither less by need than choice
      our founder dardanus as fame has sung
      and greeks acknowledge from electra sprung
      electra from the loins of atlas came
      atlas whose head sustains the starry frame
      your sire is mercury whom long before
      on cold cyllenes top fair maia bore
      maia the fair on fame if we rely
      was atlas daughter who sustains the sky
      thus from one common source our streams divide
      ours is the trojan yours th arcadian side
      raisd by these hopes i sent no news before
      nor askd your leave nor did your faith implore
      but come without a pledge my own ambassador
      the same rutulians who with arms pursue
      the trojan race are equal foes to you
      our host expelld what farther force can stay
      the victor troops from universal sway
      then will they stretch their powr athwart the land
      and either sea from side to side command
      receive our offerd faith and give us thine
      ours is a genrous and experiencd line
      we want not hearts nor bodies for the war
      in council cautious and in fields we dare

      he said and while spoke with piercing eyes
      evander viewd the man with vast surprise
      pleasd with his action ravishd with his face
      then answerd briefly with a royal grace
      o valiant leader of the trojan line
      in whom the features of thy father shine
      how i recall anchises how i see
      his motions mien and all my friend in thee
      long tho it be tis fresh within my mind
      when priam to his sisters court designd
      a welcome visit with a friendly stay
      and thro th arcadian kingdom took his way
      then past a boy the callow down began
      to shade my chin and call me first a man
      i saw the shining train with vast delight
      and priams goodly person pleasd my sight
      but great anchises far above the rest
      with awful wonder fird my youthful breast
      i longd to join in friendships holy bands
      our mutual hearts and plight our mutual hands
      i first accosted him i sued i sought
      and with a loving force to pheneus brought
      he gave me when at length constraind to go
      a lycian quiver and a gnossian bow
      a vest embroiderd glorious to behold
      and two rich bridles with their bits of gold
      which my sons coursers in obedience hold
      the league you ask i offer as your right
      and when tomorrows sun reveals the light
      with swift supplies you shall be sent away
      now celebrate with us this solemn day
      whose holy rites admit no long delay
      honour our annual feast and take your seat
      with friendly welcome at a homely treat
      thus having said the bowls removd 
      the youths replacd and soon restord the cheer
      on sods of turf he set the soldiers round
      a maple throne raisd higher from the ground
      receivd the trojan chief and oer the bed
      a lions shaggy hide for ornament they spread
      the loaves were servd in canisters the wine
      in bowls the priest renewd the rites divine
      broild entrails are their food and beefs continued chine

      but when the rage of hunger was repressd
      thus spoke evander to his royal guest
      these rites these altars and this feast o king
      from no vain fears or superstition spring
      or blind devotion or from blinder chance
      or heady zeal or brutal ignorance
      but savd from danger with a grateful sense
      the labours of a god we recompense
      see from afar yon rock that mates the sky
      about whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie
      such indigested ruin bleak and bare
      how desert now it stands exposd in air
      twas once a robbers den inclosd around
      with living stone and deep beneath the ground
      the monster cacus more than half a beast
      this hold impervious to the sun possessd
      the pavement ever foul with human gore
      heads and their mangled members hung the door
      vulcan this plague begot and like his sire
      black clouds he belchd and flakes of livid fire
      time long expected easd us of our load
      and brought the needful presence of a god
      th avenging force of hercules from spain
      arrivd in triumph from geryon slain
      thrice livd the giant and thrice livd in vain
      his prize the lowing herds alcides drove
      near tibers bank to graze the shady grove
      allurd with hope of plunder and intent
      by force to rob by fraud to circumvent
      the brutal cacus as by chance they strayd
      four oxen thence and four fair kine conveyd
      and lest the printed footsteps might be seen
      he draggd em backwards to his rocky den
      the tracks averse a lying notice gave
      and led the searcher backward from the cave

      meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place
      to find fresh pasture and untrodden grass
      the beasts who missd their mates filld all around
      with bellowings and the rocks restord the sound
      one heifer who had heard her love complain
      roard from the cave and made the project vain
      alcides found the fraud with rage he shook
      and tossd about his head his knotted oak
      swift as the winds or scythian arrows flight
      he clomb with eager haste th aerial height
      then first we saw the monster mend his pace
      fear in his eyes and paleness in his face
      confessd the gods approach trembling he springs
      as terror had increasd his feet with wings
      nor stayd for stairs but down the depth he threw
      his body on his back the door he drew
      
      he broke the heavy links the mountain closd
      and bars and levers to his foe opposd
      the wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast
      the fierce avenger came with bounding haste
      surveyd the mouth of the forbidden hold
      and here and there his raging eyes he rolld
      he gnashd his teeth and thrice he compassd round
      with winged speed the circuit of the ground
      thrice at the caverns mouth he pulld in vain
      and panting thrice desisted from his pain
      a pointed flinty rock all bare and black
      grew gibbous from behind the mountains back
      owls ravens all ill omens of the night
      here built their nests and hither wingd their flight
      the leaning head hung threatning oer the flood
      and nodded to the left the hero stood
      adverse with planted feet and from the right
      tuggd at the solid stone with all his might
      thus heavd the fixd foundations of the rock
      gave way heavn echod at the rattling shock
      tumbling it chokd the flood on either side
      the banks leap backward and the streams divide
      the sky shrunk upward with unusual dread
      and trembling tiber divd beneath his bed
      the court of cacus stands reveald to sight
      the cavern glares with newadmitted light
      so the pent vapours with a rumbling sound
      heave from below and rend the hollow ground
      a sounding flaw succeeds and from on high
      the gods with hate beheld the nether sky
      the ghosts repine at violated night
      and curse th invading sun and sicken at the sight
      the graceless monster caught in open day
      inclosd and in despair to fly away
      howls horrible from underneath and fills
      his hollow palace with unmanly yells
      the hero stands above and from afar
      plies him with darts and stones and distant war
      he from his nostrils huge mouth expires
      black clouds of smoke amidst his fathers fires
      gathring with each repeated blast the night
      to make uncertain aim and erring sight
      the wrathful god then plunges from above
      and where in thickest waves the sparkles drove
      there lights and wades thro fumes and gropes his way
      half singd half stifled till he grasps his prey
      the monster spewing fruitless flames he found
      he squeezd his throat he writhd his neck around
      and in a knot his crippled members bound
      then from their sockets tore his burning eyes
      rolld on a heap the breathless robber lies
      the doors unbarrd receive the rushing day
      and thoro lights disclose the ravishd prey
      the bulls redeemd breathe open air again
      next by the feet they drag him from his den
      the wondring neighbourhood with glad surprise
      behold his shagged breast his giant size
      his mouth that flames no more and his extinguishd eyes
      from that auspicious day with rites divine
      we worship at the heros holy shrine
      potitius first ordaind these annual vows
      as priests were added the pinarian house
      who raisd this altar in the sacred shade
      where honours ever due for ever shall be paid
      for these deserts and this high virtue shown
      ye warlike youths your heads with garlands crown
      fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood
      and with deep draughts invoke our common god

      this said a double wreath evander twind
      and poplars black and white his temples bind
      then brims his ample bowl with like design
      the rest invoke the gods with sprinkled wine
      meantime the sun descended from the skies
      and the bright evening star began to rise
      and now the priests potitius at their head
      in skins of beasts involvd the long procession led
      held high the flaming tapers in their hands
      as custom had prescribd their holy bands
      then with a second course the tables load
      and with full chargers offer to the god
      the salii sing and cense his altars round
      with saban smoke their heads with poplar bound
      one choir of old another of the young
      to dance and bear the burthen of the song
      the lay records the labours and the praise
      and all th immortal acts of hercules
      first how the mighty babe when swathd in bands
      the serpents strangled with his infant hands
      then as in years and matchless force he grew
      th oechalian walls and trojan overthrew
      besides a thousand hazards they relate
      procurd by junos and eurystheus hate
      thy hands unconquerd hero could subdue
      the cloudborn centaurs and the monster crew
      nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood
      nor he the roaring terror of the wood
      the triple porter of the stygian seat
      with lolling tongue lay fawning at thy feet
      and seizd with fear forgot his mangled meat
      th infernal waters trembled at thy sight
      thee god no face of danger could affright
      not huge typhoeus nor th unnumberd snake
      increasd with hissing heads in lernas lake
      hail joves undoubted son an added grace
      to heavn and the great author of thy race
      receive the grateful offrings which we pay
      and smile propitious on thy solemn day
      in numbers thus they sung above the rest
      the den and death of cacus crown the feast
      the woods to hollow vales convey the sound
      the vales to hills and hills the notes rebound
      the rites performd the cheerful train retire

      betwixt young pallas and his aged sire
      the trojan passd the city to survey
      and pleasing talk beguild the tedious way
      the stranger cast around his curious eyes
      new objects viewing still with new surprise
      with greedy joy enquires of various things
      and acts and monuments of ancient kings
      then thus the founder of the roman towrs
      these woods were first the seat of sylvan powrs
      of nymphs and fauns and salvage men who took
      their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak
      nor laws they knew nor manners nor the care
      of labring oxen or the shining share
      nor arts of gain nor what they gaind to spare
      their exercise the chase the running flood
      supplied their thirst the trees supplied their food
      then saturn came who fled the powr of jove
      robbd of his realms and banishd from above
      the men dispersd on hills to towns he brought
      and laws ordaind and civil customs taught
      and latium calld the land where safe he lay
      from his unduteous son and his usurping sway
      with his mild empire peace and plenty came
      and hence the golden times derivd their name
      a more degenerate and discolourd age
      succeeded this with avarice and rage
      th ausonians then and bold sicanians came
      and saturns empire often changd the name
      then kings gigantic tybris and the rest
      with arbitrary sway the land oppressd
      for tibers flood was albula before
      till from the tyrants fate his name it bore
      i last arrivd drivn from my native home
      by fortunes powr and fates resistless doom
      long tossd on seas i sought this happy land
      warnd by my mother nymph and calld by heavns command

      thus walking on he spoke and shewd the gate
      since calld carmental by the roman state
      where stood an altar sacred to the name
      of old carmenta the prophetic dame
      who to her son foretold th aenean race
      sublime in fame and romes imperial place
      then shews the forest which in after times
      fierce romulus for perpetrated crimes
      a sacred refuge made with this the shrine
      where pan below the rock had rites divine
      then tells of argus death his murderd guest
      whose grave and tomb his innocence attest
      thence to the steep tarpeian rock he leads
      now roofd with gold then thatchd with homely reeds
      a reverent fear  evn then possessd the swains
      some god they knewwhat god they could not tell
      did there amidst the sacred horror dwell
      th arcadians thought him jove and said they saw
      the mighty thundrer with majestic awe
      who took his shield and dealt his bolts around
      and scatterd tempests on the teeming ground
      then saw two heaps of ruins 
      saturnias and janiculums remains
      and either place the founders name retains
      discoursing thus together they resort
      where poor evander kept his country court
      they viewd the ground of romes litigious hall
      
      then stooping thro the narrow gate they pressd
      when thus the king bespoke his trojan guest
      mean as it is this palace and this door
      receivd alcides then a conqueror
      dare to be poor accept our homely food
      which feasted him and emulate a god
      then underneath a lowly roof he led
      the weary prince and laid him on a bed
      the stuffing leaves with hides of bears oerspread
      now night had shed her silver dews around
      and with her sable wings embracd the ground
      when loves fair goddess anxious for her son
      
      couchd with her husband in his golden bed
      with these alluring words invokes his aid
      and that her pleasing speech his mind may move
      inspires each accent with the charms of love
      while cruel fate conspird with grecian powrs
      to level with the ground the trojan towrs
      i askd not aid th unhappy to restore
      nor did the succour of thy skill implore
      nor urgd the labours of my lord in vain
      a sinking empire longer to sustain
      tho much i owd to priams house and more
      the dangers of aeneas did deplore
      but now by joves command and fates decree
      his race is doomd to reign in italy
      with humble suit i beg thy needful art
      o still propitious powr that rules my heart
      a mother kneels a suppliant for her son
      by thetis and aurora thou wert won
      to forge impenetrable shields and grace
      with fated arms a less illustrious race
      behold what haughty nations are combind
      against the relics of the phrygian kind
      with fire and sword my people to destroy
      and conquer venus twice in conquring troy
      she said and straight her arms of snowy hue
      about her unresolving husband threw
      her soft embraces soon infuse desire
      his bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire
      and all the godhead feels the wonted fire
      not half so swift the rattling thunder flies
      or forky lightnings flash along the skies
      the goddess proud of her successful wiles
      and conscious of her form in secret smiles

      then thus the powr obnoxious to her charms
      panting and half dissolving in her arms
      why seek you reasons for a cause so just
      or your own beauties or my love distrust
      long since had you requird my helpful hand
      th artificer and art you might command
      to labour arms for troy nor jove nor fate
      confind their empire to so short a date
      and if you now desire new wars to wage
      my skill i promise and my pains engage
      whatever melting metals can conspire
      or breathing bellows or the forming fire
      is freely yours your anxious fears remove
      and think no task is difficult to love
      trembling he spoke and eager of her charms
      he snatchd the willing goddess to his arms
      till in her lap infusd he lay possessd
      of full desire and sunk to pleasing rest
      now when the night her middle race had rode
      and his first slumber had refreshd the god
      the time when early housewives leave the bed
      when living embers on the hearth they spread
      supply the lamp and call the maids to rise
      with yawning mouths and with halfopend eyes
      they ply the distaff by the winking light
      and to their daily labour add the night
      thus frugally they earn their childrens bread
      and uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed
      not less concernd nor at a later hour
      rose from his downy couch the forging powr

      sacred to vulcans name an isle there lay
      betwixt sicilias coasts and lipare
      raisd high on smoking rocks and deep below
      in hollow caves the fires of aetna glow
      the cyclops here their heavy hammers deal
      loud strokes and hissings of tormented steel
      are heard around the boiling waters roar
      and smoky flames thro fuming tunnels soar
      hither the father of the fire by night
      thro the brown air precipitates his flight
      on their eternal anvils here he found
      the brethren beating and the blows go round
      a load of pointless thunder now there lies
      before their hands to ripen for the skies
      these darts for angry jove they daily cast
      consumd on mortals with prodigious waste
      three rays of writhen rain of fire three more
      of winged southern winds and cloudy store
      as many parts the dreadful mixture frame
      and fears are added and avenging flame
      inferior ministers for mars repair
      his broken axletrees and blunted war
      and send him forth again with furbishd arms
      to wake the lazy war with trumpets loud alarms
      the rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
      the shield of pallas and renew their gold
      full on the crest the gorgons head they place
      with eyes that roll in death and with distorted face

      my sons said vulcan set your tasks aside
      your strength and masterskill must now be tried
      arms for a hero forge arms that require
      your force your speed and all your forming fire
      he said they set their former work aside
      and their new toils with eager haste divide
      a flood of molten silver brass and gold
      and deadly steel in the large furnace rolld
      of this their artful hands a shield prepare
      alone sufficient to sustain the war
      sevn orbs within a spacious round they close
      one stirs the fire and one the bellows blows
      the hissing steel is in the smithy drownd
      the grot with beaten anvils groans around
      by turns their arms advance in equal time
      by turns their hands descend and hammers chime
      they turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs
      the fiery work proceeds with rustic songs

      while at the lemnian gods command they urge
      their labours thus and ply th aeolian forge
      the cheerful morn salutes evanders eyes
      and songs of chirping birds invite to rise
      he leaves his lowly bed his buskins meet
      above his ankles sandals sheathe his feet
      he sets his trusty sword upon his side
      and oer his shoulder throws a panthers hide
      two menial dogs before their master pressd
      thus clad and guarded thus he seeks his kingly guest
      mindful of promisd aid he mends his pace
      but meets aeneas in the middle space
      young pallas did his fathers steps attend
      and true achates waited on his friend
      they join their hands a secret seat they choose
      th arcadian first their former talk renews
      undaunted prince i never can believe
      the trojan empire lost while you survive
      command th assistance of a faithful friend
      but feeble are the succours i can send
      our narrow kingdom here the tiber bounds
      that other side the latian state surrounds
      insults our walls and wastes our fruitful grounds
      but mighty nations i prepare to join
      their arms with yours and aid your just design
      you come as by your better genius sent
      and fortune seems to favour your intent
      not far from hence there stands a hilly town
      of ancient building and of high renown
      torn from the tuscans by the lydian race
      who gave the name of caere to the place
      once agyllina calld it flourishd long
      in pride of wealth and warlike people strong
      till cursd mezentius in a fatal hour
      assumd the crown with arbitrary powr
      what words can paint those execrable times
      the subjects suffrings and the tyrants crimes
      that blood those murders o ye gods replace
      on his own head and on his impious race
      the living and the dead at his command
      were coupled face to face and hand to hand
      till chokd with stench in loathd embraces tied
      the lingring wretches pind away and died
      thus plungd in ills and meditating more
      the peoples patience tird no longer bore
      the raging monster but with arms beset
      his house and vengeance and destruction threat
      they fire his palace while the flame ascends
      they force his guards and execute his friends
      he cleaves the crowd and favourd by the night
      to turnus friendly court directs his flight
      by just revenge the tuscans set on fire
      with arms their king to punishment require
      their numrous troops now musterd on the strand
      my counsel shall submit to your command
      their navy swarms upon the coasts they cry
      to hoist their anchors but the gods deny
      an ancient augur skilld in future fate
      with these foreboding words restrains their hate
      ye brave in arms ye lydian blood the flowr
      of tuscan youth and choice of all their powr
      whom just revenge against mezentius arms
      to seek your tyrants death by lawful arms
      know this no native of our land may lead
      this powrful people seek a foreign head
      awd with these words in camps they still abide
      and wait with longing looks their promisd guide
      tarchon the tuscan chief to me has sent
      their crown and evry regal ornament
      the people join their own with his desire
      and all my conduct as their king require
      but the chill blood that creeps within my veins
      and age and listless limbs unfit for pains
      and a soul conscious of its own decay
      have forcd me to refuse imperial sway
      my pallas were more fit to mount the throne
      and should but hes a sabine mothers son
      and half a native but in you combine
      a manly vigour and a foreign line
      where fate and smiling fortune shew the way
      pursue the ready path to sovreign sway
      the staff of my declining days my son
      shall make your good or ill success his own
      in fighting fields from you shall learn to dare
      and serve the hard apprenticeship of war
      your matchless courage and your conduct view
      and early shall begin t admire and copy you
      besides two hundred horse he shall command
      tho few a warlike and wellchosen band
      these in my name are listed and my son
      as many more has added in his own

      scarce had he said achates and his guest
      with downcast eyes their silent grief expressd
      who short of succours and in deep despair
      shook at the dismal prospect of the war
      but his bright mother from a breaking cloud
      to cheer her issue thunderd thrice aloud
      thrice forky lightning flashd along the sky
      and tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high
      then gazing up repeated peals they hear
      and in a heavn serene refulgent arms appear
      reddning the skies and glittring all around
      the temperd metals clash and yield a silver sound
      the rest stood trembling struck with awe divine
      aeneas only conscious to the sign
      presagd th event and joyful viewd above
      th accomplishd promise of the queen of love
      then to th arcadian king this prodigy
       belongs alone to me
      heavn calls me to the war th expected sign
      is givn of promisd aid and arms divine
      my goddess mother whose indulgent care
      foresaw the dangers of the growing war
      this omen gave when bright vulcanian arms
      fated from force of steel by stygian charms
      suspended shone on high she then foreshowd
      approaching fights and fields to float in blood
      turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn
      and corps and swords and shields on tiber borne
      shall choke his flood now sound the loud alarms
      and latian troops prepare your perjurd arms

      he said and rising from his homely throne
      the solemn rites of hercules begun
      and on his altars wakd the sleeping fires
      then cheerful to his household gods retires
      there offers chosen sheep th arcadian king
      and trojan youth the same oblations bring
      next of his men and ships he makes review
      draws out the best and ablest of the crew
      down with the falling stream the refuse run
      to raise with joyful news his drooping son
      steeds are prepard to mount the trojan band
      who wait their leader to the tyrrhene land
      a sprightly courser fairer than the rest
      the king himself presents his royal guest
      a lions hide his back and limbs infold
      precious with studded work and paws of gold
      fame thro the little city spreads aloud
      th intended march amid the fearful crowd
      the matrons beat their breasts dissolve in tears
      and double their devotion in their fears
      the war at hand appears with more affright
      and rises evry moment to the sight

      then old evander with a close embrace
      straind his departing friend and tears oerflow his face
      would heavn said he my strength and youth recall
      such as i was beneath praenestes wall
      then when i made the foremost foes retire
      and set whole heaps of conquerd shields on fire
      when herilus in single fight i slew
      whom with three lives feronia did endue
      and thrice i sent him to the stygian shore
      till the last ebbing soul returnd no more
      such if i stood renewd not these alarms
      nor death should rend me from my pallas arms
      nor proud mezentius thus unpunishd boast
      his rapes and murders on the tuscan coast
      ye gods and mighty jove in pity bring
      relief and hear a father and a king
      if fate and you reserve these eyes to see
      my son return with peace and victory
      if the lovd boy shall bless his fathers sight
      if we shall meet again with more delight
      then draw my life in length let me sustain
      in hopes of his embrace the worst of pain
      but if your hard decreeswhich o i dread
      have doomd to death his undeserving head
      this o this very moment let me die
      while hopes and fears in equal balance lie
      while yet possessd of all his youthful charms
      i strain him close within these aged arms
      before that fatal news my soul shall wound
      he said and swooning sunk upon the ground
      his servants bore him off and softly laid
      his languishd limbs upon his homely bed

      the horsemen march the gates are opend wide
      aeneas at their head achates by his side
      next these the trojan leaders rode along
      last follows in the rear th arcadian throng
      young pallas shone conspicuous oer the rest
      gilded his arms embroiderd was his vest
      so from the seas exerts his radiant head
      the star by whom the lights of heavn are led
      shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews
      dispels the darkness and the day renews
      the trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd
      and follow with their eyes the dusty cloud
      which winds disperse by fits and shew from far
      the blaze of arms and shields and shining war
      the troops drawn up in beautiful array
      oer heathy plains pursue the ready way
      repeated peals of shouts are heard around
      the neighing coursers answer to the sound
      and shake with horny hoofs the solid ground

      a greenwood shade for long religion known
      stands by the streams that wash the tuscan town
      incompassd round with gloomy hills above
      which add a holy horror to the grove
      the first inhabitants of grecian blood
      that sacred forest to silvanus vowd
      the guardian of their flocks and fields and pay
      their due devotions on his annual day
      not far from hence along the rivers side
      in tents secure the tuscan troops abide
      by tarchon led now from a rising ground
      aeneas cast his wondring eyes around
      and all the tyrrhene army had in sight
      stretchd on the spacious plain from left to right
      thither his warlike train the trojan led
      refreshd his men and wearied horses fed

      meantime the mother goddess crownd with charms
      breaks thro the clouds and brings the fated arms
      within a winding vale she finds her son
      on the cool rivers banks retird alone
      she shews her heavnly form without disguise
      and gives herself to his desiring eyes
      behold she said performd in evry part
      my promise made and vulcans labourd art
      now seek secure the latian enemy
      and haughty turnus to the field defy
      she said and having first her son embracd
      the radiant arms beneath an oak she placd
      proud of the gift he rolld his greedy sight
      around the work and gazd with vast delight
      he lifts he turns he poises and admires
      the crested helm that vomits radiant fires
      his hands the fatal sword and corslet hold
      one keen with temperd steel one stiff with gold
      both ample flaming both and beamy bright
      so shines a cloud when edgd with adverse light
      he shakes the pointed spear and longs to try
      the plated cuishes on his manly thigh
      but most admires the shields mysterious mould
      and roman triumphs rising on the gold
      for these embossd the heavnly smith had wrought
      
      the wars in order and the race divine
      of warriors issuing from the julian line
      the cave of mars was dressd with mossy greens
      there by the wolf were laid the martial twins
      intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung
      the foster dam lolld out her fawning tongue
      they suckd secure while bending back her head
      she lickd their tender limbs and formd them as they fed
      not far from thence new rome appears with games
      projected for the rape of sabine dames
      the pit resounds with shrieks a war succeeds
      for breach of public faith and unexampled deeds
      here for revenge the sabine troops contend
      the romans there with arms the prey defend
      wearied with tedious war at length they cease
      and both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace
      the friendly chiefs before joves altar stand
      both armd with each a charger in his hand
      a fatted sow for sacrifice is led
      with imprecations on the perjurd head
      near this the traitor metius stretchd between
      four fiery steeds is draggd along the green
      by tullus doom the brambles drink his blood
      and his torn limbs are left the vultures food
      there porsena to rome proud tarquin brings
      and would by force restore the banishd kings
      one tyrant for his fellowtyrant fights
      the roman youth assert their native rights
      before the town the tuscan army lies
      to win by famine or by fraud surprise
      their king halfthreatning halfdisdaining stood
      while cocles broke the bridge and stemmd the flood
      the captive maids there tempt the raging tide
      scapd from their chains with cloelia for their guide
      high on a rock heroic manlius stood
      to guard the temple and the temples god
      then rome was poor and there you might behold
      the palace thatchd with straw now roofd with gold
      the silver goose before the shining gate
      there flew and by her cackle savd the state
      she told the gauls approach th approaching gauls
      obscure in night ascend and seize the walls
      the gold dissembled well their yellow hair
      and golden chains on their white necks they wear
      gold are their vests long alpine spears they wield
      and their left arm sustains a length of shield
      hard by the leaping salian priests advance
      and naked thro the streets the mad luperci dance
      in caps of wool the targets droppd from heavn
      here modest matrons in soft litters drivn
      to pay their vows in solemn pomp appear
      and odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear
      far hence removd the stygian seats are seen
      pains of the damnd and punishd catiline
      hung on a rockthe traitor and around
      the furies hissing from the nether ground
      apart from these the happy souls he draws

      betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea
      but foaming surges there in silver play
      the dancing dolphins with their tails divide

      aghast she looks and heaves her breast for breath
      panting and pale with fear of future death
      the god had figurd her as drivn along
      by winds and waves and scudding thro the throng
      just opposite sad nilus opens wide
      his arms and ample bosom to the tide
      and spreads his mantle oer the winding coast
      in which he wraps his queen and hides the flying host
      the victor to the gods his thanks expressd
      and rome triumphant with his presence blessd
      three hundred temples in the town he placd
      with spoils and altars evry temple gracd
      three shining nights and three succeeding days
      the fields resound with shouts the streets with praise
      the domes with songs the theatres with plays
      all altars flame before each altar lies
      drenchd in his gore the destind sacrifice
      great caesar sits sublime upon his throne
      before apollos porch of parian stone
      accepts the presents vowd for victory
      and hangs the monumental crowns on high
      vast crowds of vanquishd nations march along
      various in arms in habit and in tongue
      here mulciber assigns the proper place
      for carians and th ungirt numidian race
      then ranks the thracians in the second row
      with scythians expert in the dart and bow
      and here the tamd euphrates humbly glides
      and there the rhine submits her swelling tides
      and proud araxes whom no bridge could bind
      the danes unconquerd offspring march behind
      and morini the last of humankind

      these figures on the shield divinely wrought
      by vulcan labourd and by venus brought
      with joy and wonder fill the heros thought
      unknown the names he yet admires the grace
      and bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race






      while these affairs in distant places passd
      the various iris juno sends with haste
      to find bold turnus who with anxious thought
      the secret shade of his great grandsire sought
      retird alone she found the daring man
      and opd her rosy lips and thus began
      what none of all the gods could grant thy vows
      that turnus this auspicious day bestows
      aeneas gone to seek th arcadian prince
      has left the trojan camp without defence
      and short of succours there employs his pains
      in parts remote to raise the tuscan swains
      now snatch an hour that favours thy designs
      unite thy forces and attack their lines
      this said on equal wings she poisd her weight
      and formd a radiant rainbow in her flight

      the daunian hero lifts his hands and eyes
      and thus invokes the goddess as she flies
      iris the grace of heavn what powr divine
      has sent thee down thro dusky clouds to shine
      see they divide immortal day appears
      and glittring planets dancing in their spheres
      with joy these happy omens i obey
      and follow to the war the god that leads the way
      thus having said as by the brook he stood
      he scoopd the water from the crystal flood
      then with his hands the drops to heavn he throws
      and loads the powrs above with offerd vows

      now march the bold confedrates thro the plain
      well horsd well clad a rich and shining train
      messapus leads the van and in the rear
      the sons of tyrrheus in bright arms appear
      in the main battle with his flaming crest
      the mighty turnus towrs above the rest
      silent they move majestically slow
      like ebbing nile or ganges in his flow
      the trojans view the dusty cloud from far
      and the dark menace of the distant war
      caicus from the rampire saw it rise
      blackning the fields and thickning thro the skies
      then to his fellows thus aloud he calls
      what rolling clouds my friends approach the walls
      arm arm and man the works prepare your spears
      and pointed darts the latian host appears

      thus warnd they shut their gates with shouts ascend
      the bulwarks and secure their foes attend
      for their wise genral with foreseeing care
      had chargd them not to tempt the doubtful war
      nor tho provokd in open fields advance
      but close within their lines attend their chance
      unwilling yet they keep the strict command
      and sourly wait in arms the hostile band
      the fiery turnus flew before the rest
      a piebald steed of thracian strain he pressd
      his helm of massy gold and crimson was his crest
      with twenty horse to second his designs
      an unexpected foe he facd the lines
      is there he said in arms who bravely dare
      his leaders honour and his danger share
      then spurring on his brandishd dart he threw
      in sign of war applauding shouts ensue

      amazd to find a dastard race that run
      behind the rampires and the battle shun
      he rides around the camp with rolling eyes
      and stops at evry post and evry passage tries
      so roams the nightly wolf about the fold
      wet with descending showrs and stiff with cold
      he howls for hunger and he grins for pain
      
      and impotent of anger finds no way
      in his distended paws to grasp the prey
      the mothers listen but the bleating lambs
      securely swig the dug beneath the dams
      thus ranges eager turnus oer the plain
      sharp with desire and furious with disdain
      surveys each passage with a piercing sight
      to force his foes in equal field to fight
      thus while he gazes round at length he spies
      where fencd with strong redoubts their navy lies
      close underneath the walls the washing tide
      secures from all approach this weaker side
      he takes the wishd occasion fills his hand
      with ready fires and shakes a flaming brand
      urgd by his presence evry soul is warmd
      and evry hand with kindled fires is armd
      from the fird pines the scattring sparkles fly
      fat vapours mixd with flames involve the sky
      what powr o muses could avert the flame
      which threatend in the fleet the trojan name
      tell for the fact thro length of time obscure
      is hard to faith yet shall the fame endure

      tis said that when the chief prepard his flight
      and felld his timber from mount idas height
      the grandam goddess then approachd her son
      and with a mothers majesty begun
      grant me she said the sole request i bring
      since conquerd heavn has ownd you for its king
      on idas brows for ages past there stood
      with firs and maples filld a shady wood
      and on the summit rose a sacred grove
      where i was worshipd with religious love
      those woods that holy grove my long delight
      i gave the trojan prince to speed his flight
      now filld with fear on their behalf i come
      let neither winds oerset nor waves intomb
      the floating forests of the sacred pine
      but let it be their safety to be mine
      then thus replied her awful son who rolls
      the radiant stars and heavn and earth controls
      how dare you mother endless date demand
      for vessels moulded by a mortal hand
      what then is fate shall bold aeneas ride
      of safety certain on th uncertain tide
      yet what i can i grant when wafted oer
      the chief is landed on the latian shore
      whatever ships escape the raging storms
      at my command shall change their fading forms
      to nymphs divine and plow the watry way
      like dotis and the daughters of the sea
      to seal his sacred vow by styx he swore
      the lake of liquid pitch the dreary shore
      and phlegethons innavigable flood
      and the black regions of his brother god
      he said and shook the skies with his imperial nod

      and now at length the numberd hours were come
      prefixd by fates irrevocable doom
      when the great mother of the gods was free
      to save her ships and finish joves decree
      first from the quarter of the morn there sprung
      a light that signd the heavns and shot along
      then from a cloud fringd round with golden fires
      were timbrels heard and berecynthian choirs
      and last a voice with more than mortal sounds
      both hosts in arms opposd with equal horror wounds
      o trojan race your needless aid forbear
      and know my ships are my peculiar care
      with greater ease the bold rutulian may
      with hissing brands attempt to burn the sea
      than singe my sacred pines but you my charge
      loosd from your crooked anchors launch at large
      exalted each a nymph forsake the sand
      and swim the seas at cybeles command
      no sooner had the goddess ceasd to speak
      when lo th obedient ships their haulsers break
      and strange to tell like dolphins in the main
      they plunge their prows and dive and spring again
      as many beauteous maids the billows sweep
      as rode before tall vessels on the deep

      the foes surprisd with wonder stood aghast
      messapus curbd his fiery coursers haste
      old tiber roard and raising up his head
      calld back his waters to their oozy bed
      turnus alone undaunted bore the shock
      and with these words his trembling troops bespoke
      these monsters for the trojans fate are meant
      and are by jove for black presages sent
      he takes the cowards last relief away
      for fly they cannot and constraind to stay
      must yield unfought a base inglorious prey
      the liquid half of all the globe is lost
      heavn shuts the seas and we secure the coast
      theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
      which myriads of our martial men surround
      their fates i fear not or vain oracles
      twas givn to venus they should cross the seas
      and land secure upon the latian plains
      their promisd hour is passd and mine remains
      tis in the fate of turnus to destroy
      with sword and fire the faithless race of troy
      shall such affronts as these alone inflame
      the grecian brothers and the grecian name
      my cause and theirs is one a fatal strife
      and final ruin for a ravishd wife
      was t not enough that punishd for the crime
      they fell but will they fall a second time
      one would have thought they paid enough before
      to curse the costly sex and durst offend no more
      can they securely trust their feeble wall
      a slight partition a thin interval
      betwixt their fate and them when troy tho built
      by hands divine yet perishd by their guilt
      lend me for once my friends your valiant hands
      to force from out their lines these dastard bands
      less than a thousand ships will end this war
      nor vulcan needs his fated arms prepare
      let all the tuscans all th arcadians join
      nor these nor those shall frustrate my design
      let them not fear the treasons of the night
      the robbd palladium the pretended flight
      our onset shall be made in open light
      no wooden engine shall their town betray
      fires they shall have around but fires by day
      no grecian babes before their camp appear
      whom hectors arms detaind to the tenth tardy year
      now since the sun is rolling to the west
      give we the silent night to needful rest
      refresh your bodies and your arms prepare
      the morn shall end the small remains of war

      the post of honour to messapus falls
      to keep the nightly guard to watch the walls
      to pitch the fires at distances around
      and close the trojans in their scanty ground
      twice seven rutulian captains ready stand
      and twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command
      all clad in shining arms the works invest
      each with a radiant helm and waving crest
      stretchd at their length they press the grassy ground
      they laugh they sing 
      with lights and cheerful fires renew the day
      and pass the wakeful night in feasts and play

      the trojans from above their foes beheld
      and with armd legions all the rampires filld
      seizd with affright their gates they first explore
      join works to works with bridges towr to towr
      thus all things needful for defence abound
      mnestheus and brave seresthus walk the round
      commissiond by their absent prince to share
      the common danger and divide the care
      the soldiers draw their lots and as they fall
      by turns relieve each other on the wall

      nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance
      to watch the gate was warlike nisus chance
      his father hyrtacus of noble blood
      his mother was a huntress of the wood
      and sent him to the wars well could he bear
      his lance in fight and dart the flying spear
      but better skilld unerring shafts to send
      beside him stood euryalus his friend
      euryalus than whom the trojan host
      no fairer face or sweeter air could boast
      scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun
      one was their care and their delight was one
      one common hazard in the war they shard
      and now were both by choice upon the guard

      then nisus thus or do the gods inspire
      this warmth or make we gods of our desire
      a genrous ardour boils within my breast
      eager of action enemy to rest
      this urges me to fight and fires my mind
      to leave a memorable name behind
      thou seest the foe secure how faintly shine
      their scatterd fires the most in sleep supine
      along the ground an easy conquest lie
      the wakeful few the fuming flagon ply
      all hushd around now hear what i revolve
      a thought unripeand scarcely yet resolve
      our absent prince both camp and council mourn
      by message both would hasten his return
      if they confer what i demand on thee
      
      methinks beneath yon hill i have espied
      a way that safely will my passage guide

      euryalus stood listning while he spoke
      with love of praise and noble envy struck
      then to his ardent friend exposd his mind
      all this alone and leaving me behind
      am i unworthy nisus to be joind
      thinkst thou i can my share of glory yield
      or send thee unassisted to the field
      not so my father taught my childhood arms
      born in a siege and bred among alarms
      nor is my youth unworthy of my friend
      nor of the heavnborn hero i attend
      the thing calld life with ease i can disclaim
      and think it oversold to purchase fame

      then nisus thus alas thy tender years
      would minister new matter to my fears
      so may the gods who view this friendly strife
      restore me to thy lovd embrace with life
      condemnd to pay my vows 
      this thy request is cruel and unjust
      but if some chanceas many chances are
      and doubtful hazards in the deeds of war
      if one should reach my head there let it fall
      and spare thy life i would not perish all
      thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date
      live thou to mourn thy loves unhappy fate
      to bear my mangled body from the foe
      or buy it back and funral rites bestow
      or if hard fortune shall those dues deny
      thou canst at least an empty tomb supply
      o let not me the widows tears renew
      nor let a mothers curse my name pursue
      thy pious parent who for love of thee
      forsook the coasts of friendly sicily
      her age committing to the seas and wind
      when evry weary matron stayd behind
      to this euryalus you plead in vain
      and but protract the cause you cannot gain
      no more delays but haste with that he wakes
      the nodding watch each to his office takes
      the guard relievd the genrous couple went
      to find the council at the royal tent

      all creatures else forgot their daily care
      and sleep the common gift of nature share
      except the trojan peers who wakeful sate
      in nightly council for th indangerd state
      they vote a message to their absent chief
      shew their distress and beg a swift relief
      amid the camp a silent seat they chose
      remote from clamour and secure from foes
      on their left arms their ample shields they bear
      the right reclind upon the bending spear
      now nisus and his friend approach the guard
      and beg admission eager to be heard
      th affair important not to be deferrd
      ascanius bids em be conducted in
      ordring the more experiencd to begin
      then nisus thus ye fathers lend your ears
      nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years
      the foe securely drenchd in sleep and wine
      neglect their watch the fires but thinly shine
      and where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies
      covring the plain and curling to the skies
      betwixt two paths which at the gate divide
      close by the sea a passage we have spied
      which will our way to great aeneas guide
      expect each hour to see him safe again
      loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain
      snatch we the lucky minute while we may
      nor can we be mistaken in the way
      for hunting in the vale we both have seen
      the rising turrets and the stream between
      and know the winding course with evry ford

      he ceasd and old alethes took the word
      our country gods in whom our trust we place
      will yet from ruin save the trojan race
      while we behold such dauntless worth appear
      in dawning youth and souls so void of fear
      then into tears of joy the father broke
      each in his longing arms by turns he took
      panted and pausd and thus again he spoke
      ye brave young men what equal gifts can we
      in recompense of such desert decree
      the greatest sure and best you can receive
      the gods and your own conscious worth will give
      the rest our grateful genral will bestow
      and young ascanius till his manhood owe

      and i whose welfare in my father lies
      ascanius adds by the great deities
      by my dear country by my household gods
      by hoary vestas rites and dark abodes
      adjure you both 
      make me but happy in his safe return
      whose wanted presence i can only mourn
      your common gift shall two large goblets be
      of silver wrought with curious imagery
      and high embossd which when old priam reignd
      my conquring sire at sackd arisba gaind
      and more two tripods cast in antique mould
      with two great talents of the finest gold
      beside a costly bowl ingravd with art
      which dido gave when first she gave her heart
      but if in conquerd italy we reign
      when spoils by lot the victor shall obtain
      thou sawst the courser by proud turnus pressd
      that nisus and his arms and nodding crest
      and shield from chance exempt shall be thy share
      twelve labring slaves twelve handmaids young and fair
      all clad in rich attire and traind with care
      and last a latian field with fruitful plains
      and a large portion of the kings domains
      but thou whose years are more to mine allied
      no fate my vowd affection shall divide
      from thee heroic youth be wholly mine
      take full possession all my soul is thine
      one faith one fame one fate shall both attend
      my lifes companion and my bosom friend
      my peace shall be committed to thy care
      and to thy conduct my concerns in war

      then thus the young euryalus replied
      whatever fortune good or bad betide
      the same shall be my age as now my youth
      no time shall find me wanting to my truth
      this only from your goodness let me gain
      
      of priams royal race my mother came
      and sure the best that ever bore the name
      whom neither troy nor sicily could hold
      from me departing but oerspent and old
      my fate she followd ignorant of this
       danger neither parting kiss
      nor pious blessing taken her i leave
      and in this only act of all my life deceive
      by this right hand and conscious night i swear
      my soul so sad a farewell could not bear
      be you her comfort fill my vacant place
      
      support her age forsaken and distressd
      that hope alone will fortify my breast
      against the worst of fortunes and of fears
      he said the movd assistants melt in tears

      then thus ascanius wonderstruck to see
      that image of his filial piety
      so great beginnings in so green an age
      exact the faith which i again engage
      thy mother all the dues shall justly claim
      creusa had and only want the name
      whateer event thy bold attempt shall have
      tis merit to have borne a son so brave
      now by my head a sacred oath i swear
       what returning here
      crownd with success i for thyself prepare
      that if thou fail shall thy lovd mother share

      he said and weeping while he spoke the word
      from his broad belt he drew a shining sword
      magnificent with gold lycaon made
      and in an ivory scabbard sheathd the blade
      this was his gift great mnestheus gave his friend
      a lions hide his body to defend
      and good alethes furnishd him beside
      with his own trusty helm of temper tried

      thus armd they went the noble trojans wait
      their issuing forth and follow to the gate
      with prayers and vows above the rest appears
      ascanius manly far beyond his years
      and messages committed to their care
      which all in winds were lost and flitting air

      the trenches first they passd then took their way
      where their proud foes in pitchd pavilions lay
      to many fatal ere themselves were slain
      they found the careless host dispersd upon the plain
      who gorgd and drunk with wine supinely snore
      unharnessd chariots stand along the shore
      amidst the wheels and reins the goblet by
      a medley of debauch and war they lie
      observing nisus shewd his friend the sight
      behold a conquest gaind without a fight
      occasion offers and i stand prepard
      there lies our way be thou upon the guard
      and look around while i securely go
      and hew a passage thro the sleeping foe
      softly he spoke then striding took his way
      with his drawn sword where haughty rhamnes lay
      his head raisd high on tapestry beneath
      and heaving from his breast he drew his breath
      a king and prophet by king turnus lovd
      but fate by prescience cannot be removd
      him and his sleeping slaves he slew then spies
      where remus with his rich retinue lies
      his armourbearer first and next he kills
      his charioteer intrenchd betwixt the wheels
      and his lovd horses last invades their lord
      full on his neck he drives the fatal sword
      the gasping head flies off a purple flood
      flows from the trunk that welters in the blood
      which by the spurning heels dispersd around
      the bed besprinkles and bedews the ground
      lamus the bold and lamyrus the strong
      he slew and then serranus fair and young
      from dice and wine the youth retird to rest
      and puffd the fumy god from out his breast
      evn then he dreamt of drink and lucky play
      more lucky had it lasted till the day
      the famishd lion thus with hunger bold
      oerleaps the fences of the nightly fold
      and tears the peaceful flocks with silent awe
      trembling they lie and pant beneath his paw

      nor with less rage euryalus employs
      the wrathful sword or fewer foes destroys
      but on th ignoble crowd his fury flew
      he fadus hebesus and rhoetus slew
      oppressd with heavy sleep the former fell
      but rhoetus wakeful and observing all
      behind a spacious jar he slinkd for fear
      the fatal iron found and reachd him there
      for as he rose it piercd his naked side
      and reeking thence returnd in crimson dyed
      the wound pours out a stream of wine and blood
      the purple soul comes floating in the flood

      now where messapus quarterd they arrive
      the fires were fainting there and just alive
      the warriorhorses tied in order fed
      nisus observd the discipline and said
      our eager thirst of blood may both betray
      and see the scatterd streaks of dawning day
      foe to nocturnal thefts no more my friend
      here let our glutted execution end
      a lane thro slaughterd bodies we have made
      the bold euryalus tho loth obeyd
      of arms and arras and of plate they find
      a precious load but these they leave behind
      yet fond of gaudy spoils the boy would stay
      to make the rich caparison his prey
      which on the steed of conquerd rhamnes lay
      nor did his eyes less longingly behold
      the girdlebelt with nails of burnishd gold
      this present caedicus the rich bestowd
      on remulus when friendship first they vowd
      and absent joind in hospitable ties
      he dying to his heir bequeathd the prize
      till by the conquring ardean troops oppressd
      he fell and they the glorious gift possessd
      these glittring spoils 
      he to his body suits but suits in vain
      messapus helm he finds among the rest
      and laces on and wears the waving crest
      proud of their conquest prouder of their prey
      they leave the camp and take the ready way

      but far they had not passd before they spied
      three hundred horse with volscens for their guide
      the queen a legion to king turnus sent
      but the swift horse the slower foot prevent
      and now advancing sought the leaders tent
      they saw the pair for thro the doubtful shade
      his shining helm euryalus betrayd
      on which the moon with full reflection playd
      tis not for naught cried volscens from the crowd
      these men go there then raisd his voice aloud
      stand stand why thus in arms and whither bent
      from whence to whom and on what errand sent
      silent they scud away and haste their flight
      to neighbring woods and trust themselves to night
      the speedy horse all passages belay
      and spur their smoking steeds to cross their way
      and watch each entrance of the winding wood
      black was the forest thick with beech it stood
      horrid with fern and intricate with thorn
      few paths of human feet or tracks of beasts were worn
      the darkness of the shades his heavy prey
      and fear misled the younger from his way
      but nisus hit the turns with happier haste
      and thoughtless of his friend the forest passd
      and alban plains from albas name so calld
      where king latinus then his oxen stalld
      till turning at the length he stood his ground
      and missd his friend and cast his eyes around
      ah wretch he cried where have i left behind
      th unhappy youth where shall i hope to find
      or what way take again he ventures back
      and treads the mazes of his former track
      he winds the wood and listning hears the noise
      of tramping coursers and the riders voice
      the sound approachd and suddenly he viewd
      the foes inclosing and his friend pursued
      forelaid and taken while he strove in vain
      the shelter of the friendly shades to gain
      what should he next attempt what arms employ
      what fruitless force to free the captive boy
      or desperate should he rush and lose his life
      with odds oppressd in such unequal strife

      resolvd at length his pointed spear he shook
      and casting on the moon a mournful look
      guardian of groves and goddess of the night
      fair queen he said direct my dart aright
      if eer my pious father for my sake
      did grateful offrings on thy altars make
      or i increasd them with my sylvan toils
      and hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils
      give me to scatter these then from his ear
      he poisd and aimd and launchd the trembling spear
      the deadly weapon hissing from the grove
      impetuous on the back of sulmo drove
      piercd his thin armour drank his vital blood
      and in his body left the broken wood
      he staggers round his eyeballs roll in death
      and with short sobs he gasps away his breath
      all stand amazda second javlin flies
      with equal strength and quivers thro the skies
      this thro thy temples tagus forcd the way
      and in the brainpan warmly buried lay
      fierce volscens foams with rage and gazing round
      descried not him who gave the fatal wound
      nor knew to fix revenge but thou he cries
      shalt pay for both and at the prisner flies
      with his drawn sword then struck with deep despair
      that cruel sight the lover could not bear
      but from his covert rushd in open view
      and sent his voice before him as he flew
      me me he criedturn all your swords alone
      on methe fact confessd the fault my own
      he neither could nor durst the guiltless youth
      ye moon and stars bear witness to the truth
      his only crime 
      is too much love to his unhappy friend
      too late he speaks the sword which fury guides
      drivn with full force had piercd his tender sides
      down fell the beauteous youth the yawning wound
      gushd out a purple stream and staind the ground
      his snowy neck reclines upon his breast
      like a fair flowr by the keen share oppressd
      like a white poppy sinking on the plain
      whose heavy head is overchargd with rain
      despair and rage and vengeance justly vowd
      drove nisus headlong on the hostile crowd
      volscens he seeks on him alone he bends
      borne back and bord by his surrounding friends
      onward he pressd and kept him still in sight
      then whirld aloft his sword with all his might
      th unerring steel descended while he spoke
      piercd his wide mouth and thro his weazon broke
      dying he slew and staggring on the plain
      with swimming eyes he sought his lover slain
      then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell
      content in death to be revengd so well

      o happy friends for if my verse can give
      immortal life your fame shall ever live
      fixd as the capitols foundation lies
      and spread whereer the roman eagle flies

      the conquring party first divide the prey
      then their slain leader to the camp convey
      with wonder as they went the troops were filld
      to see such numbers whom so few had killd
      serranus rhamnes and the rest they found
      vast crowds the dying and the dead surround
      and the yet reeking blood oerflows the ground
      all knew the helmet which messapus lost
      but mournd a purchase that so dear had cost
      now rose the ruddy morn from tithons bed
      and with the dawn of day the skies oerspread
      nor long the sun his daily course withheld
      but added colours to the world reveald
      when early turnus wakning with the light
      all clad in armour calls his troops to fight
      his martial men with fierce harangue he fird
      and his own ardour in their souls inspird
      this doneto give new terror to his foes
      the heads of nisus and his friend he shows
      raisd high on pointed spearsa ghastly sight
      loud peals of shouts ensue and barbarous delight

      meantime the trojans run where danger calls
      they line their trenches and they man their walls
      in front extended to the left they stood
      safe was the right surrounded by the flood
      but casting from their towrs a frightful view
      they saw the faces which too well they knew
      tho then disguisd in death and smeard all oer
      with filth obscene and dropping putrid gore
      soon hasty fame thro the sad city bears
      the mournful message to the mothers ears
      an icy cold benumbs her limbs she shakes
      her cheeks the blood her hand the web forsakes
      she runs the rampires round amidst the war
      nor fears the flying darts she rends her hair
      and fills with loud laments the liquid air
      thus then my lovd euryalus appears
      thus looks the prop of my declining years
      wast on this face my famishd eyes i fed
      ah how unlike the living is the dead
      and couldst thou leave me cruel thus alone
      not one kind kiss from a departing son
      no look no last adieu before he went
      in an illboding hour to slaughter sent
      cold on the ground and pressing foreign clay
      to latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey
      nor was i near to close his dying eyes
      to wash his wounds to weep his obsequies
      to call about his corpse his crying friends
      or spread the mantle 
      on his dear body which i wove with care
      nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare
      where shall i find his corpse what earth sustains
      his trunk dismemberd and his cold remains
      for this alas i left my needful ease
      exposd my life to winds and winter seas
      if any pity touch rutulian hearts
      here empty all your quivers all your darts
      or if they fail thou jove conclude my woe
      and send me thunderstruck to shades below
      her shrieks and clamours pierce the trojans ears
      unman their courage and augment their fears
      nor young ascanius could the sight sustain
      nor old ilioneus his tears restrain
      but actor and idaeus jointly sent
      to bear the madding mother to her tent

      and now the trumpets terribly from far
      with rattling clangour rouse the sleepy war
      the soldiers shouts succeed the brazen sounds
      and heavn from pole to pole the noise rebounds
      the volscians bear their shields upon their head
      and rushing forward form a moving shed
      these fill the ditch those pull the bulwarks down
      some raise the ladders others scale the town
      but where void spaces on the walls appear
      or thin defence they pour their forces there
      with poles and missive weapons from afar
      the trojans keep aloof the rising war
      taught by their ten years siege defensive fight
      they roll down ribs of rocks an unresisted weight
      to break the penthouse with the pondrous blow
      which yet the patient volscians undergo
      but could not bear th unequal combat long
      for where the trojans find the thickest throng
      the ruin falls their shatterd shields give way
      and their crushd heads become an easy prey
      they shrink for fear abated of their rage
      nor longer dare in a blind fight engage
      contented now to gall them from below
      with darts and slings and with the distant bow

      elsewhere mezentius terrible to view
      a blazing pine within the trenches threw
      but brave messapus neptunes warlike son
      broke down the palisades the trenches won
      and loud for ladders calls to scale the town

      calliope begin ye sacred nine
      inspire your poet in his high design
      to sing what slaughter manly turnus made
      what souls he sent below the stygian shade
      what fame the soldiers with their captain share
      and the vast circuit of the fatal war
      for you in singing martial facts excel
      you best remember and alone can tell

      there stood a towr amazing to the sight
      built up of beams and of stupendous height
      art and the nature of the place conspird
      to furnish all the strength that war requird
      to level this the bold italians join
      the wary trojans obviate their design
      with weighty stones oerwhelm their troops below
      shoot thro the loopholes and sharp javlins throw
      turnus the chief tossd from his thundring hand
      against the wooden walls a flaming brand
      it stuck the fiery plague the winds were high
      the planks were seasond and the timber dry
      contagion caught the posts it spread along
      scorchd and to distance drove the scatterd throng
      the trojans fled the fire pursued amain
      still gathring fast upon the trembling train
      till crowding to the corners of the wall
      down the defence and the defenders fall
      the mighty flaw makes heavn itself resound
      the dead and dying trojans strew the ground
      the towr that followd on the fallen crew
      whelmd oer their heads and buried whom it slew
      some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent
      all the same equal ruin underwent

      young lycus and helenor only scape
      savdhow they know notfrom the steepy leap
      helenor elder of the two by birth
      on one side royal one a son of earth
      whom to the lydian king licymnia bare
      and sent her boasted bastard to the war
      
      slight were his arms a sword and silver shield
      no marks of honour chargd its empty field
      light as he fell so light the youth arose
      and rising found himself amidst his foes
      nor flight was left nor hopes to force his way
      emboldend by despair he stood at bay
      and like a stag whom all the troop surrounds
      of eager huntsmen and invading hounds
      resolvd on death he dissipates his fears
      and bounds aloft against the pointed spears
      so dares the youth secure of death and throws
      his dying body on his thickest foes
      but lycus swifter of his feet by far
      runs doubles winds and turns amidst the war
      springs to the walls and leaves his foes behind
      and snatches at the beam he first can find
      looks up and leaps aloft at all the stretch
      in hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach
      but turnus followd hard his hunted prey
      
      fool said the chief tho fleeter than the wind
      couldst thou presume to scape when i pursue
      he said and downward by the feet he drew
      the trembling dastard at the tug he falls
      vast ruins come along rent from the smoking walls
      thus on some silver swan or timrous hare
      joves bird comes sousing down from upper air
      her crooked talons truss the fearful prey
      then out of sight she soars and wings her way
      so seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb
      in vain lamented by the bleating dam

      then rushing onward with a barbrous cry
      the troops of turnus to the combat fly
      the ditch with fagots filld the daring foe
      tossd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw

      ilioneus as bold lucetius came
      to force the gate and feed the kindling flame
      rolld down the fragment of a rock so right
      it crushd him double underneath the weight
      two more young liger and asylas slew
      to bend the bow young liger better knew
      asylas best the pointed javlin threw
      brave caeneus laid ortygius on the plain
      the victor caeneus was by turnus slain
      by the same hand clonius and itys fall
      sagar and ida standing on the wall
      from capys arms his fate privernus found
      hurt by themilla firstbut slight the wound
      his shield thrown by to mitigate the smart
      he clappd his hand upon the wounded part
      the second shaft came swift and unespied
      and piercd his hand and naild it to his side
      transfixd his breathing lungs and beating heart
      the soul came issuing out and hissd against the dart

      the son of arcens shone amid the rest
      in glittring armour and a purple vest
      
      bred by his father in the martian grove
      where the fat altars of palicus flame
      and send in arms to purchase early fame
      him when he spied from far the tuscan king
      laid by the lance and took him to the sling
      thrice whirld the thong around his head and threw
      the heated lead half melted as it flew
      it piercd his hollow temples and his brain
      the youth came tumbling down and spurnd the plain

      then young ascanius who before this day
      was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey
      first bent in martial strife the twanging bow
      and exercisd against a human foe
      with this bereft numanus of his life
      who turnus younger sister took to wife
      proud of his realm and of his royal bride
      vaunting before his troops and lengthend with a stride
      in these insulting terms the trojans he defied

      twiceconquerd cowards now your shame is shown
      coopd up a second time within your town
      who dare not issue forth in open field
      but hold your walls before you for a shield
      thus treat you war thus our alliance force
      what gods what madness hither steerd your course
      you shall not find the sons of atreus here
      nor need the frauds of sly ulysses fear
      strong from the cradle of a sturdy brood
      we bear our newborn infants to the flood
      there bathd amid the stream our boys we hold
      with winter hardend and inurd to cold
      they wake before the day to range the wood
      kill ere they eat nor taste unconquerd food
      no sports but what belong to war they know
      to break the stubborn colt to bend the bow
      our youth of labour patient earn their bread
      hardly they work with frugal diet fed
      from plows and harrows sent to seek renown
      they fight in fields and storm the shaken town
      no part of life from toils of war is free
      no change in age or diffrence in degree
      we plow and till in arms our oxen feel
      instead of goads the spur and pointed steel
      th inverted lance makes furrows in the plain
      evn time that changes all yet changes us in vain
      the body not the mind nor can control
      th immortal vigour or abate the soul
      our helms defend the young disguise the gray
      we live by plunder and delight in prey
      your vests embroiderd with rich purple shine
      in sloth you glory and in dances join
      your vests have sweeping sleeves with female pride
      your turbans underneath your chins are tied
      go phrygians to your dindymus again
      go less than women in the shapes of men
      go mixd with eunuchs in the mothers rites
      where with unequal sound the flute invites
      sing dance and howl by turns in idas shade
      resign the war to men who know the martial trade

      this foul reproach ascanius could not hear
      with patience or a vowd revenge forbear
      at the full stretch of both his hands he drew
      and almost joind the horns of the tough yew
      but first before the throne of jove he stood
      and thus with lifted hands invokd the god
      my first attempt great jupiter succeed
      an annual offring in thy grove shall bleed
      a snowwhite steer before thy altar led
      who like his mother bears aloft his head
      butts with his threatning brows and bellowing stands
      and dares the fight and spurns the yellow sands

      jove bowd the heavns and lent a gracious ear
      and thunderd on the left amidst the clear
      sounded at once the bow and swiftly flies
      the featherd death and hisses thro the skies
      the steel thro both his temples forcd the way
      extended on the ground numanus lay
      go now vain boaster and true valour scorn
      the phrygians twice subdued yet make this third return
      ascanius said no more the trojans shake
      the heavns with shouting and new vigour take

      apollo then bestrode a golden cloud
      to view the feats of arms and fighting crowd
      and thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud
      advance illustrious youth increase in fame
      and wide from east to west extend thy name
      offspring of gods thyself and rome shall owe
      to thee a race of demigods below
      this is the way to heavn the powrs divine
      from this beginning date the julian line
      to thee to them and their victorious heirs
      the conquerd war is due and the vast world is theirs
      troy is too narrow for thy name he said
      and plunging downward shot his radiant head
      dispelld the breathing air that broke his flight
      shorn of his beams a man to mortal sight
      old butes form he took anchises squire
      now left to rule ascanius by his sire
      his wrinkled visage and his hoary hairs
      his mien his habit and his arms he wears
      and thus salutes the boy too forward for his years
      suffice it thee thy fathers worthy son
      the warlike prize thou hast already won
      the god of archers gives thy youth a part
      of his own praise nor envies equal art
      now tempt the war no more he said and flew
      obscure in air and vanishd from their view
      the trojans by his arms their patron know
      and hear the twanging of his heavnly bow
      then duteous force they use and phoebus name
      to keep from fight the youth too fond of fame
      undaunted they themselves no danger shun
      from wall to wall the shouts and clamours run
      they bend their bows they whirl their slings around
      heaps of spent arrows fall and strew the ground
      and helms and shields and rattling arms resound
      the combat thickens like the storm that flies
      from westward when the showry kids arise
      or pattring hail comes pouring on the main
      when jupiter descends in hardend rain
      or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound
      and with an armed winter strew the ground

      pandrus and bitias thunderbolts of war
      whom hiera to bold alcanor bare
      on idas top two youths of height and size
      like firs that on their mother mountain rise
      presuming on their force the gates unbar
      and of their own accord invite the war
      with fates averse against their kings command
      armd on the right and on the left they stand
      and flank the passage shining steel they wear
      and waving crests above their heads appear
      thus two tall oaks that padus banks adorn
      lift up to heavn their leafy heads unshorn
      and overpressd with natures heavy load
      dance to the whistling winds and at each other nod
      in flows a tide of latians when they see
      the gate set open and the passage free
      bold quercens with rash tmarus rushing on
      equicolus that in bright armour shone
      and haemon first but soon repulsd they fly
      or in the welldefended pass they die
      these with success are fird and those with rage
      and each on equal terms at length engage
      drawn from their lines and issuing on the plain
      the trojans hand to hand the fight maintain

      fierce turnus in another quarter fought
      when suddenly th unhopdfor news was brought
      the foes had left the fastness of their place
      prevaild in fight and had his men in chase
      he quits th attack and to prevent their fate
      runs where the giant brothers guard the gate
      the first he met antiphates the brave
      but basebegotten on a theban slave
      sarpedons son he slew the deadly dart
      found passage thro his breast and piercd his heart
      fixd in the wound th italian cornel stood
      warmd in his lungs and in his vital blood
      aphidnus next and erymanthus dies
      and meropes and the gigantic size
      of bitias threatning with his ardent eyes
      not by the feeble dart he fell oppressd
      
      but from a knotted lance large heavy strong
      which roard like thunder as it whirld along
      not two bull hides th impetuous force withhold
      nor coat of double mail with scales of gold
      down sunk the monster bulk and pressd the ground
      his arms and clattring shield on the vast body sound
      not with less ruin than the bajan mole
      raisd on the seas the surges to control
      at once comes tumbling down the rocky wall
      prone to the deep the stones disjointed fall
      of the vast pile the scatterd ocean flies
      black sands discolourd froth and mingled mud arise
      the frighted billows roll and seek the shores
      then trembles prochyta then ischia roars
      typhoeus thrown beneath by joves command
      astonishd at the flaw that shakes the land
      soon shifts his weary side and scarce awake
      with wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back

      the warrior god the latian troops inspird
      new strung their sinews and their courage fird
      but chills the trojan hearts with cold affright
      then black despair precipitates their flight

      when pandarus beheld his brother killd
      the town with fear and wild confusion filld
      he turns the hinges of the heavy gate
      with both his hands and adds his shoulders to the weight
      some happier friends within the walls inclosd
      the rest shut out to certain death exposd
      fool as he was and frantic in his care
      t admit young turnus and include the war
      he thrust amid the crowd securely bold
      like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold
      too late his blazing buckler they descry
      and sparkling fires that shot from either eye
      his mighty members and his ample breast
      his rattling armour and his crimson crest

      far from that hated face the trojans fly
      all but the fool who sought his destiny
      mad pandarus steps forth with vengeance vowd
      for bitias death and threatens thus aloud
      these are not ardeas walls nor this the town
      amata proffers with lavinias crown
      tis hostile earth you tread of hope bereft
      no means of safe return by flight are left
      to whom with countnance calm and soul sedate
      thus turnus then begin and try thy fate
      my message to the ghost of priam bear
      tell him a new achilles sent thee there

      a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw
      rough in the rind and knotted as it grew
      with his full force he whirld it first around
      but the soft yielding air receivd the wound
      imperial juno turnd the course before
      and fixd the wandring weapon in the door

      but hope not thou said turnus when i strike
      to shun thy fate our force is not alike
      nor thy steel temperd by the lemnian god
      then rising on his utmost stretch he stood
      and aimd from high the full descending blow
      cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two
      down sinks the giant with a thundring sound
      his pondrous limbs oppress the trembling ground
      blood brains and foam gush from the gaping wound
      scalp face and shoulders the keen steel divides
      and the shard visage hangs on equal sides
      the trojans fly from their approaching fate
      and had the victor then securd the gate
      and to his troops without unclosd the bars
      one lucky day had ended all his wars
      but boiling youth and blind desire of blood
      pushd on his fury to pursue the crowd
      hamstringd behind unhappy gyges died
      then phalaris is added to his side
      the pointed javlins from the dead he drew
      and their friends arms against their fellows threw
      strong halys stands in vain weak phlegys flies
      saturnia still at hand new force and fire supplies
      then halius prytanis alcander fall
      engagd against the foes who scald the wall
      but whom they feard without they found within
      at last tho late by lynceus he was seen
      he calls new succours and assaults the prince
      but weak his force and vain is their defence
      turnd to the right his sword the hero drew
      and at one blow the bold aggressor slew
      he joints the neck and with a stroke so strong
      the helm flies off and bears the head along
      next him the huntsman amycus he killd
      in darts envenomd and in poison skilld
      then clytius fell beneath his fatal spear
      and creteus whom the muses held so dear
      he fought with courage and he sung the fight
      arms were his busness verses his delight

      the trojan chiefs behold with rage and grief
      their slaughterd friends and hasten their relief
      bold mnestheus rallies first the broken train
      whom brave seresthus and his troop sustain
      to save the living and revenge the dead
      against one warriors arms all troy they led
      o void of sense and courage mnestheus cried
      where can you hope your coward heads to hide
      ah where beyond these rampires can you run
      one man and in your camp inclosd you shun
      shall then a single sword such slaughter boast
      and pass unpunishd from a numrous host
      forsaking honour and renouncing fame
      your gods your country and your king you shame
      this just reproach their virtue does excite
      they stand they join they thicken to the fight

      now turnus doubts and yet disdains to yield
      but with slow paces measures back the field
      and inches to the walls where tibers tide
      washing the camp defends the weaker side
      the more he loses they advance the more
      and tread in evry step he trod before
      they shout they bear him back and whom by might
      they cannot conquer they oppress with weight

      as compassd with a wood of spears around
      the lordly lion still maintains his ground
      grins horrible retires and turns again
      threats his distended paws and shakes his mane
      he loses while in vain he presses on
      nor will his courage let him dare to run
      so turnus fares and unresolved of flight
      moves tardy back and just recedes from fight
      yet twice enragd the combat he renews
      twice breaks and twice his broken foes pursues
      but now they swarm and with fresh troops supplied
      come rolling on and rush from evry side
      nor juno who sustaind his arms before
      dares with new strength suffice th exhausted store
      for jove with sour commands sent iris down
      to force th invader from the frighted town

      with labour spent no longer can he wield
      the heavy falchion or sustain the shield
      oerwhelmd with darts which from afar they fling
      the weapons round his hollow temples ring
      his golden helm gives way with stony blows
      batterd and flat and beaten to his brows
      his crest is rashd away his ample shield
      is falsified and round with javlins filld

      the foe now faint the trojans overwhelm
      and mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm
      sick sweat succeeds he drops at evry pore
      with driving dust his cheeks are pasted oer
      shorter and shorter evry gasp he takes
      and vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes
      plungd in the flood and made the waters fly
      the yellow god the welcome burthen bore
      and wipd the sweat and washd away the gore
      then gently wafts him to the farther coast
      and sends him safe to cheer his anxious host



 

      the gates of heavn unfold jove summons all
      the gods to council in the common hall
      sublimely seated he surveys from far
      the fields the camp the fortune of the war
      and all th inferior world from first to last
      the sovreign senate in degrees are placd

      then thus th almighty sire began ye gods
      natives or denizens of blest abodes
      from whence these murmurs and this change of mind
      this backward fate from what was first designd
      why this protracted war when my commands
      pronouncd a peace and gave the latian lands
      what fear or hope on either part divides
      our heavns and arms our powers on diffrent sides
      a lawful time of war at length will come
      
      when carthage shall contend the world with rome
      shall force the rigid rocks and alpine chains
      and like a flood come pouring on the plains
      then is your time for faction and debate
      for partial favour and permitted hate
      let now your immature dissension cease
      sit quiet and compose your souls to peace

      thus jupiter in few unfolds the charge
      but lovely venus thus replies at large
      o powr immense eternal energy
      
      seest thou the proud rutulians how they dare
      in fields unpunishd and insult my care
      how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train
      in shining arms triumphant on the plain
      evn in their lines and trenches they contend
      and scarce their walls the trojan troops defend
      the town is filld with slaughter and oerfloats
      with a red deluge their increasing moats
      aeneas ignorant and far from thence
      has left a camp exposd without defence
      this endless outrage shall they still sustain
      shall troy renewd be forcd and fird again
      a second siege my banishd issue fears
      and a new diomede in arms appears
      one more audacious mortal will be found
      and i thy daughter wait another wound
      yet if with fates averse without thy leave
      the latian lands my progeny receive
      bear they the pains of violated law
      and thy protection from their aid withdraw
      but if the gods their sure success foretell
      if those of heavn consent with those of hell
      to promise italy who dare debate
      the powr of jove or fix another fate
      what should i tell of tempests on the main
      of aeolus usurping neptunes reign
      of iris sent with bacchanalian heat
      t inspire the matrons and destroy the fleet
      now juno to the stygian sky descends
      solicits hell for aid and arms the fiends
      that new example wanted yet above
      an act that well became the wife of jove
      alecto raisd by her with rage inflames
      the peaceful bosoms of the latian dames
      imperial sway no more exalts my mind
      
      now let my happier foes possess my place
      whom jove prefers before the trojan race
      and conquer they whom you with conquest grace
      since you can spare from all your wide command
      no spot of earth no hospitable land
      which may my wandring fugitives receive
      
      then father 
      by ruind troy yet smoking from the flame
      i beg you let ascanius by my care
      be freed from danger and dismissd the war
      inglorious let him live without a crown
      the father may be cast on coasts unknown
      struggling with fate but let me save the son
      mine is cythera mine the cyprian towrs
      in those recesses and those sacred bowrs
      obscurely let him rest his right resign
      to promisd empire and his julian line
      then carthage may th ausonian towns destroy
      nor fear the race of a rejected boy
      what profits it my son to scape the fire
      armd with his gods and loaded with his sire
      to pass the perils of the seas and wind
      evade the greeks and leave the war behind
      to reach th italian shores if after all
      our second pergamus is doomd to fall
      much better had he curbd his high desires
      and hoverd oer his illextinguishd fires
      to simois banks the fugitives restore
      and give them back to war and all the woes before

      deep indignation swelld saturnias heart
      and must i own she said my secret smart
      what with more decence were in silence kept
      and but for this unjust reproach had slept
      did god or man your favrite son advise
      with war unhopd the latians to surprise
      by fate you boast and by the gods decree
      he left his native land for italy
      confess the truth by mad cassandra more
      than heavn inspird he sought a foreign shore
      did i persuade to trust his second troy
      to the raw conduct of a beardless boy
      with walls unfinishd which himself forsakes
      and thro the waves a wandring voyage takes
      when have i urgd him meanly to demand
      the tuscan aid and arm a quiet land
      did i or iris give this mad advice
      or made the fool himself the fatal choice
      you think it hard the latians should destroy
      with swords your trojans and with fires your troy
      hard and unjust indeed for men to draw
      their native air nor take a foreign law
      that turnus is permitted still to live
      to whom his birth a god and goddess give
      but yet is just and lawful for your line
      to drive their fields and force with fraud to join
      realms not your own among your clans divide
      and from the bridegroom tear the promisd bride
      petition while you public arms prepare
      pretend a peace and yet provoke a war
      twas givn to you your darling son to shroud
      to draw the dastard from the fighting crowd
      and for a man obtend an empty cloud
      from flaming fleets you turnd the fire away
      and changd the ships to daughters of the sea
      but is my crimethe queen of heavn offends
      if she presume to save her suffring friends
      your son not knowing what his foes decree
      you say is absent absent let him be
      yours is cythera yours the cyprian towrs
      the soft recesses and the sacred bowrs
      why do you then these needless arms prepare
      and thus provoke a people prone to war
      did i with fire the trojan town deface
      or hinder from return your exild race
      was i the cause of mischief or the man
      whose lawless lust the fatal war began
      think on whose faith th adultrous youth relied
      who promisd who procurd the spartan bride
      when all th united states of greece combind
      to purge the world of the perfidious kind
      then was your time to fear the trojan fate
      your quarrels and complaints are now too late

      thus juno murmurs rise with mixd applause
      just as they favour or dislike the cause
      so winds when yet unfledgd in woods they lie
      in whispers first their tender voices try
      then issue on the main with bellowing rage
      and storms to trembling mariners presage

      then thus to both replied th imperial god
      who shakes heavns axles with his awful nod
      
      celestials your attentive ears incline
      since said the god the trojans must not join
      in wishd alliance with the latian line
      since endless jarrings and immortal hate
      tend but to discompose our happy state
      the war henceforward be resignd to fate
      each to his proper fortune stand or fall
      equal and unconcernd i look on all
      rutulians trojans are the same to me
      and both shall draw the lots their fates decree
      let these assault if fortune be their friend
      and if she favours those let those defend
      the fates will find their way the thundrer said
      and shook the sacred honours of his head
      attesting styx th inviolable flood
      and the black regions of his brother god
      trembled the poles of heavn and earth confessd the nod
      this end the sessions had the senate rise
      and to his palace wait their sovreign thro the skies

      meantime intent upon their siege the foes
      within their walls the trojan host inclose
      they wound they kill they watch at evry gate
      renew the fires and urge their happy fate

      th aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief
      hopeless of flight more hopeless of relief
      thin on the towrs they stand and evn those few
      a feeble fainting and dejected crew
      yet in the face of danger some there stood
      the two bold brothers of sarpedons blood
      asius and acmon both th assaraci
      young haemon and tho young resolvd to die
      with these were clarus and thymoetes joind
      tibris and castor both of lycian kind
      from acmons hands a rolling stone there came
      so large it half deservd a mountains name
      strongsinewd was the youth and big of bone
      his brother mnestheus could not more have done
      or the great father of th intrepid son
      some firebrands throw some flights of arrows send
      and some with darts and some with stones defend

      amid the press appears the beauteous boy
      the care of venus and the hope of troy
      his lovely face unarmd his head was bare
      in ringlets oer his shoulders hung his hair
      his forehead circled with a diadem
      distinguishd from the crowd he shines a gem
      enchasd in gold or polishd ivry set
      amidst the meaner foil of sable jet

      nor ismarus was wanting to the war
      directing pointed arrows from afar
      and death with poison armdin lydia born
      where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn
      where proud pactolus floats the fruitful lands
      and leaves a rich manure of golden sands
      there capys author of the capuan name
      and there was mnestheus too increasd in fame
      since turnus from the camp he cast with shame

      thus mortal war was wagd on either side
      meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide
      for anxious from evander when he went
      he sought the tyrrhene camp and tarchons tent
      exposd the cause of coming to the chief
      his name and country told and askd relief
      proposd the terms his own small strength declard
      what vengeance proud mezentius had prepard
      what turnus bold and violent designd
      then shewd the slippry state of humankind
      and fickle fortune warnd him to beware
      and to his wholesome counsel added prayr
      tarchon without delay the treaty signs
      and to the trojan troops the tuscan joins

      they soon set sail nor now the fates withstand
      their forces trusted with a foreign hand
      aeneas leads upon his stern appear
      two lions carvd which rising ida bear
      ida to wandring trojans ever dear
      under their grateful shade aeneas sate
      revolving wars events and various fate
      his left young pallas kept fixd to his side
      and oft of winds enquird and of the tide
      oft of the stars and of their watry way
      and what he sufferd both by land and sea

      now sacred sisters open all your spring
      the tuscan leaders and their army sing
      which followd great aeneas to the war
      their arms their numbers and their names declare

      a thousand youths brave massicus obey
      borne in the tiger thro the foaming sea
      from asium brought and cosa by his care
      for arms light quivers bows and shafts they bear
      fierce abas next his men bright armour wore
      his stern apollos golden statue bore
      six hundred populonia sent along
      all skilld in martial exercise and strong
      three hundred more for battle ilva joins
      an isle renownd for steel and unexhausted mines
      asylas on his prow the third appears
      who heavn interprets and the wandring stars
      from offerd entrails prodigies expounds
      and peals of thunder with presaging sounds
      a thousand spears in warlike order stand
      sent by the pisans under his command

      fair astur follows in the watry field
      proud of his managd horse and painted shield
      gravisca noisome from the neighbring fen
      and his own caere sent three hundred men
      with those which minios fields and pyrgi gave
      all bred in arms unanimous and brave

      thou muse the name of cinyras renew
      and brave cupavo followd but by few
      whose helm confessd the lineage of the man
      and bore with wings displayd a silver swan
      love was the fault of his famd ancestry
      whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly
      for cycnus lovd unhappy phaeton
      and sung his loss in poplar groves alone
      beneath the sister shades to soothe his grief
      heavn heard his song and hastend his relief
      and changd to snowy plumes his hoary hair
      and wingd his flight to chant aloft in air
      his son cupavo brushd the briny flood
      upon his stern a brawny centaur stood
      who heavd a rock and threatning still to throw
      with lifted hands alarmd the seas below
      they seemd to fear the formidable sight
      and rolld their billows on to speed his flight

      ocnus was next who led his native train
      of hardy warriors thro the watry plain
      the son of manto by the tuscan stream
      from whence the mantuan town derives the name
      an ancient city but of mixd descent
      three sevral tribes compose the government
      four towns are under each but all obey
      the mantuan laws and own the tuscan sway

      hate to mezentius armd five hundred more
      whom mincius from his sire benacus bore
      mincius with wreaths of reeds his forehead coverd oer
      these grave auletes leads a hundred sweep
      with stretching oars at once the glassy deep
      him and his martial train the triton bears
      high on his poop the seagreen god appears
      frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound
      and at the blast the billows dance around
      a hairy man above the waist he shows
      a porpoise tail beneath his belly grows
      and ends a fish his breast the waves divides
      and froth and foam augment the murmring tides

      full thirty ships transport the chosen train
      for troys relief and scour the briny main

      now was the world forsaken by the sun
      and phoebe half her nightly race had run
      the careful chief who never closd his eyes
      himself the rudder holds the sails supplies
      a choir of nereids meet him on the flood
      once his own galleys hewn from idas wood
      but now as many nymphs the sea they sweep
      as rode before tall vessels on the deep
      they know him from afar and in a ring
      enclose the ship that bore the trojan king
      cymodoce whose voice excelld the rest
      above the waves advancd her snowy breast
      her right hand stops the stern her left divides
      the curling ocean and corrects the tides
      she spoke for all the choir and thus began
      with pleasing words to warn th unknowing man
      sleeps our lovd lord o goddessborn awake
      spread evry sail pursue your watry track
      and haste your course your navy once were we
      from idas height descending to the sea
      till turnus as at anchor fixd we stood
      presumd to violate our holy wood
      then loosd from shore we fled his fires profane
      
      and since have sought you thro the tuscan main
      the mighty mother changd our forms to these
      and gave us life immortal in the seas
      but young ascanius in his camp distressd
      by your insulting foes is hardly pressd
      th arcadian horsemen and etrurian host
      advance in order on the latian coast
      to cut their way the daunian chief designs
      before their troops can reach the trojan lines
      thou when the rosy morn restores the light
      first arm thy soldiers for th ensuing fight
      thyself the fated sword of vulcan wield
      and bear aloft th impenetrable shield
      tomorrows sun unless my skill be vain
      shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain
      parting she spoke and with immortal force
      pushd on the vessel in her watry course
      for well she knew the way impelld behind
      the ship flew forward and outstrippd the wind
      the rest make up unknowing of the cause
      the chief admires their speed and happy omens draws

      then thus he prayd and fixd on heavn his eyes
      hear thou great mother of the deities
      with turrets crownd 
      firm thy own omens lead us on to fight
      and let thy phrygians conquer in thy right

      he said no more and now renewing day
      had chasd the shadows of the night away
      he chargd the soldiers with preventing care
      their flags to follow and their arms prepare
      warnd of th ensuing fight and bade em hope the war
      now his lofty poop he viewd below
      his camp incompassd and th inclosing foe
      his blazing shield imbracd he held on high
      the camp receive the sign and with loud shouts reply
      hope arms their courage from their towrs they throw
      their darts with double force and drive the foe
      thus at the signal givn the cranes arise
      before the stormy south and blacken all the skies

      king turnus wonderd at the fight renewd
      till looking back the trojan fleet he viewd
      the seas with swelling canvas coverd oer
      and the swift ships descending on the shore
      the latians saw from far with dazzled eyes
      the radiant crest that seemd in flames to rise
      and dart diffusive fires around the field
      and the keen glittring of the golden shield
      thus threatning comets when by night they rise
      shoot sanguine streams and sadden all the skies
      so sirius flashing forth sinister lights
      pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright

      yet turnus with undaunted mind is bent
      to man the shores and hinder their descent
      and thus awakes the courage of his friends
      what you so long have wishd kind fortune sends
      in ardent arms to meet th invading foe
      you find and find him at advantage now
      yours is the day you need but only dare
      your swords will make you masters of the war
      your sires your sons your houses and your lands
      and dearest wifes are all within your hands
      be mindful of the race from whence you came
      and emulate in arms your fathers fame
      now take the time while staggring yet they stand
      with feet unfirm and prepossess the strand
      fortune befriends the bold nor more he said
      but balancd whom to leave and whom to lead
      then these elects the landing to prevent
      and those he leaves to keep the city pent

      meantime the trojan sends his troops ashore
      some are by boats exposd by bridges more
      with labring oars they bear along the strand
      where the tide languishes and leap aland
      tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes
      and where no ford he finds no water fries
      nor billows with unequal murmurs roar
      but smoothly slide along and swell the shore
      that course he steerd and thus he gave command
      here ply your oars and at all hazard land
      force on the vessel that her keel may wound
      this hated soil and furrow hostile ground
      let me securely landi ask no more
      then sink my ships or shatter on the shore

      this fiery speech inflames his fearful friends
      they tug at evry oar and evry stretcher bends
      they run their ships aground the vessels knock
       and tremble with the shock
      tarchons alone was lost that stranded stood
      stuck on a bank and beaten by the flood
      she breaks her back the loosend sides give way
      and plunge the tuscan soldiers in the sea
      their broken oars and floating planks withstand
      their passage while they labour to the land
      and ebbing tides bear back upon th uncertain sand

      now turnus leads his troops without delay
      advancing to the margin of the sea
      the trumpets sound aeneas first assaild
      the clowns newraisd and raw and soon prevaild
      great theron fell an omen of the fight
      great theron large of limbs of giant height
      he first in open field defied the prince
      but armour scald with gold was no defence
      against the fated sword which opend wide
      his plated shield and piercd his naked side
      next lichas fell who not like others born
      was from his wretched mother rippd and torn
      sacred o phoebus from his birth to thee
      for his beginning life from biting steel was free
      not far from him was gyas laid along
      of monstrous bulk with cisseus fierce and strong
      vain bulk and strength for when the chief assaild
      nor valour nor herculean arms availd
      nor their famd father wont in war to go
      with great alcides while he toild below
      the noisy pharos next receivd his death
      aeneas writhd his dart and stoppd his bawling breath
      then wretched cydon had receivd his doom
      who courted clytius in his beardless bloom
      and sought with lust obscene polluted joys
      the trojan sword had curd his love of boys
      had not his sevn bold brethren stoppd the course
      of the fierce champions with united force
      sevn darts were thrown at once and some rebound
      from his bright shield some on his helmet sound
      the rest had reachd him but his mothers care
      prevented those and turnd aside in air

      the prince then calld achates to supply
      the spears that knew the way to victory
      those fatal weapons which inurd to blood
      in grecian bodies under ilium stood
      not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
      against our foes on this contended plain
      he said then seizd a mighty spear and threw
      which wingd with fate thro maeons buckler flew
      piercd all the brazen plates and reachd his heart
      he staggerd with intolerable smart
      alcanor saw and reachd but reachd in vain
      his helping hand his brother to sustain
      a second spear which kept the former course
      from the same hand and sent with equal force
      his right arm piercd and holding on bereft
      his use of both and piniond down his left
      then numitor from his dead brother drew
      th illomend spear and at the trojan threw
      preventing fate directs the lance awry
      which glancing only markd achates thigh

      in pride of youth the sabine clausus came
      and from afar at dryops took his aim
      the spear flew hissing thro the middle space
      and piercd his throat directed at his face
      it stoppd at once the passage of his wind
      and the free soul to flitting air resignd
      his forehead was the first that struck the ground
      lifeblood and life rushd mingled thro the wound
      he slew three brothers of the borean race
      and three whom ismarus their native place
      had sent to war but all the sons of thrace
      halesus next the bold aurunci leads
      the son of neptune to his aid succeeds
      conspicuous on his horse on either hand
      these fight to keep and those to win the land
      with mutual blood th ausonian soil is dyed
      while on its borders each their claim decide
      as wintry winds contending in the sky
      with equal force of lungs their titles try
      they rage they roar the doubtful rack of heavn
      stands without motion and the tide undrivn
      each bent to conquer neither side to yield
      they long suspend the fortune of the field
      both armies thus perform what courage can
      foot set to foot and mingled man to man

      but in another part th arcadian horse
      with ill success engage the latin force
      for where th impetuous torrent rushing down
      huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown
      they left their coursers and unusd to fight
      on foot were scatterd in a shameful flight
      pallas who with disdain and grief had viewd
      his foes pursuing and his friends pursued
      usd threatnings mixd with prayrs his last resource
      with these to move their minds with those to fire their force
      which way companions whether would you run
      by you yourselves and mighty battles won
      by my great sire by his establishd name
      and early promise of my future fame
      by my youth emulous of equal right
      to share his honoursshun ignoble flight
      trust not your feet your hands must hew way
      thro yon black body and that thick array
      tis thro that forward path that we must come
      there lies our way and that our passage home
      nor powrs above nor destinies below
      oppress our arms with equal strength we go
      with mortal hands to meet a mortal foe
      see on what foot we stand a scanty shore
      the sea behind our enemies before
      no passage left unless we swim the main
      or forcing these the trojan trenches gain
      this said he strode with eager haste along
      and bore amidst the thickest of the throng
      lagus the first he met with fate to foe
      had heavd a stone of mighty weight to throw
      stooping the spear descended on his chine
      just where the bone distinguished either loin
      it stuck so fast so deeply buried lay
      that scarce the victor forcd the steel away
      hisbon came on but while he movd too slow
      to wishd revenge the prince prevents his blow
      for warding his at once at once he pressd
      and plungd the fatal weapon in his breast
      then lewd anchemolus he laid in dust
      who staind his stepdams bed with impious lust
      and after him the daucian twins were slain
      laris and thymbrus on the latian plain
      so wondrous like in feature shape and size
      as causd an error in their parents eyes
      grateful mistake but soon the sword decides
      the nice distinction and their fate divides
      for thymbrus head was loppd and laris hand
      dismemberd sought its owner on the strand
      the trembling fingers yet the falchion strain
      and threaten still th intended stroke in vain

      now to renew the charge th arcadians came
      sight of such acts and sense of honest shame
      and grief with anger mixd their minds inflame
      then with a casual blow was rhoeteus slain
      who chancd as pallas threw to cross the plain
      the flying spear was after ilus sent
      but rhoeteus happend on a death unmeant
      from teuthras and from tyres while he fled
      the lance athwart his body laid him dead
      rolld from his chariot with a mortal wound
      and intercepted fate he spurnd the ground
      as when in summer welcome winds arise
      the watchful shepherd to the forest flies
      and fires the midmost plants contagion spreads
      and catching flames infect the neighbring heads
      around the forest flies the furious blast
      and all the leafy nation sinks at last
      and vulcan rides in triumph oer the waste
      the pastor pleasd with his dire victory
      beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky
      so pallas troops their scatterd strength unite
      and pouring on their foes their prince delight

      halesus came fierce with desire of blood
      but first collected in his arms he stood
      advancing then he plied the spear so well
      ladon demodocus and pheres fell
      around his head he tossd his glittring brand
      and from strymonius hewd his better hand
      held up to guard his throat then hurld a stone
      at thoas ample front and piercd the bone
      it struck beneath the space of either eye
      and blood and mingled brains together fly
      deep skilld in future fates halesus sire
      did with the youth to lonely groves retire
      but when the fathers mortal race was run
      dire destiny laid hold upon the son
      and hauld him to the war to find beneath
      th evandrian spear a memorable death
      pallas th encounter seeks but ere he throws
      to tuscan tiber thus addressd his vows
      o sacred stream direct my flying dart
      and give to pass the proud halesus heart
      his arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear
      pleasd with the bribe the god receivd his prayr
      for while his shield protects a friend distressd
      the dart came driving on and piercd his breast

      but lausus no small portion of the war
      permits not panic fear to reign too far
      causd by the death of so renownd a knight
      but by his own example cheers the fight
      fierce abas first he slew abas the stay
      of trojan hopes and hindrance of the day
      the phrygian troops escapd the greeks in vain
      they and their mixd allies now load the plain
      to the rude shock of war both armies came
      their leaders equal and their strength the same
      the rear so pressd the front they could not wield
      their angry weapons to dispute the field
      here pallas urges on and lausus there
      of equal youth and beauty both appear
      but both by fate forbid to breathe their native air
      their congress in the field great jove withstands
      both doomd to fall but fall by greater hands

      meantime juturna warns the daunian chief
      of lausus danger urging swift relief
      with his drivn chariot he divides the crowd
      and making to his friends thus calls aloud
      let none presume his needless aid to join
      retire and clear the field the fight is mine
      to this right hand is pallas only due
      o were his father here my just revenge to view
      from the forbidden space his men retird
      pallas their awe and his stern words admird
      surveyd him oer and oer with wondring sight
      struck with his haughty mien and towring height
      then to the king your empty vaunts forbear
      success i hope and fate i cannot fear
      alive or dead i shall deserve a name
      jove is impartial and to both the same
      he said and to the void advancd his pace
      pale horror sate on each arcadian face
      then turnus from his chariot leaping light
      addressd himself on foot to single fight
      and as a lionwhen he spies from far
      a bull that seems to meditate the war
      bending his neck and spurning back the sand
      runs roaring downward from his hilly stand
      imagine eager turnus not more slow
      to rush from high on his unequal foe

      young pallas when he saw the chief advance
      within due distance of his flying lance
      prepares to charge him first resolvd to try
      if fortune would his want of force supply
      and thus to heavn and hercules addressd
      alcides once on earth evanders guest
      his son adjures you by those holy rites
      that hospitable board those genial nights
      assist my great attempt to gain this prize
      and let proud turnus view with dying eyes
      his ravishd spoils twas heard the vain request
      alcides mournd and stifled sighs within his breast
      then jove to soothe his sorrow thus began
      short bounds of life are set to mortal man
      tis virtues work alone to stretch the narrow span
      so many sons of gods in bloody fight
      around the walls of troy have lost the light
      my own sarpedon fell beneath his foe
      nor i his mighty sire could ward the blow
      evn turnus shortly shall resign his breath
      and stands already on the verge of death
      this said the god permits the fatal fight
      but from the latian fields averts his sight

      now with full force his spear young pallas threw
      and having thrown his shining falchion drew
      the steel just grazd along the shoulder joint
      and markd it slightly with the glancing point
      fierce turnus first to nearer distance drew
      and poisd his pointed spear before he threw
      then as the winged weapon whizzd along
      see now said he whose arm is better strung
      the spear kept on the fatal course unstayd
      by plates of irn which oer the shield were laid
      thro folded brass and tough bull hides it passd
      his corslet piercd and reachd his heart at last
      in vain the youth tugs at the broken wood
      the soul comes issuing with the vital blood
      he falls his arms upon his body sound
      and with his bloody teeth he bites the ground

      turnus bestrode the corpse arcadians hear
      said he my message to your master bear
      such as the sire deservd the son i send
      it costs him dear to be the phrygians friend
      the lifeless body tell him i bestow
      unaskd to rest his wandring ghost below
      he said and trampled down with all the force
      of his left foot and spurnd the wretched corse
      then snatchd the shining belt with gold inlaid
      the belt eurytions artful hands had made
      where fifty fatal brides expressd to sight
      all in the compass of one mournful night
      deprivd their bridegrooms of returning light

      in an ill hour insulting turnus tore
      those golden spoils and in a worse he wore
      o mortals blind in fate who never know
      to bear high fortune or endure the low
      the time shall come when turnus but in vain
      shall wish untouchd the trophies of the slain
      shall wish the fatal belt were far away
      and curse the dire remembrance of the day

      the sad arcadians from th unhappy field
      bear back the breathless body on a shield
      o grace and grief of war at once restord
      with praises to thy sire at once deplord
      one day first sent thee to the fighting field
      beheld whole heaps of foes in battle killd
      one day beheld thee dead and borne upon thy shield
      this dismal news not from uncertain fame
      but sad spectators to the hero came
      his friends upon the brink of ruin stand
      unless relievd by his victorious hand
      he whirls his sword around without delay
      and hews thro adverse foes an ample way
      to find fierce turnus of his conquest proud
      evander pallas all that friendship owd
      to large deserts are present to his eyes
      his plighted hand and hospitable ties

      four sons of sulmo four whom ufens bred
      he took in fight and living victims led
      to please the ghost of pallas and expire
      in sacrifice before his funral fire
      at magus next he threw he stoopd below
      the flying spear and shunnd the promisd blow
      then creeping claspd the heros knees and prayd
      by young iulus by thy fathers shade
      o spare my life and send me back to see
      my longing sire and tender progeny
      a lofty house i have and wealth untold
      in silver ingots and in bars of gold
      all these and sums besides which see no day
      the ransom of this one poor life shall pay
      if i survive will troy the less prevail
      a single souls too light to turn the scale
      he said the hero sternly thus replied
      thy bars and ingots and the sums beside
      leave for thy childrens lot thy turnus broke
      all rules of war by one relentless stroke
      when pallas fell so deems nor deems alone
      my fathers shadow but my living son
      thus having said of kind remorse bereft
      he seizd his helm and draggd him with his left
      then with his right hand while his neck he wreathd
      up to the hilts his shining falchion sheathd

      apollos priest emonides was near
      his holy fillets on his front appear
      glittring in arms he shone amidst the crowd
      much of his god more of his purple proud
      him the fierce trojan followd thro the field
      the holy coward fell and forcd to yield
      the prince stood oer the priest and at one blow
      sent him an offring to the shades below
      his arms seresthus on his shoulders bears
      designd a trophy to the god of wars

      vulcanian caeculus renews the fight
      and umbro born upon the mountains height
      the champion cheers his troops t encounter those
      and seeks revenge himself on other foes
      at anxurs shield he drove and at the blow
      both shield and arm to ground together go
      anxur had boasted much of magic charms
      and thought he wore impenetrable arms
      so made by mutterd spells and from the spheres
      had life securd in vain for length of years
      then tarquitus the field in triumph trod
      a nymph his mother his sire a god
      exulting in bright arms he braves the prince
      with his protended lance he makes defence
      bears back his feeble foe then pressing on
      arrests his better hand and drags him down
      stands oer the prostrate wretch and as he lay
      vain tales inventing and prepard to pray
      mows off his head the trunk a moment stood
      then sunk and rolld along the sand in blood
      the vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain
      lie there proud man unpitied on the plain
      lie there inglorious and without a tomb
      far from thy mother and thy native home
      exposed to savage beasts and birds of prey
      or thrown for food to monsters of the sea

      on lycas and antaeus next he ran
      two chiefs of turnus and who led his van
      they fled for fear with these he chasd along
      camers the yellowlockd and numa strong
      both great in arms and both were fair and young
      camers was son to volscens lately slain
      in wealth surpassing all the latian train
      and in amycla fixd his silent easy reign
      and as aegaeon when with heavn he strove
      stood opposite in arms to mighty jove
      movd all his hundred hands provokd the war
      defied the forky lightning from afar
      at fifty mouths his flaming breath expires
      and flash for flash returns and fires for fires
      in his right hand as many swords he wields
      and takes the thunder on as many shields
      with strength like his the trojan hero stood
      and soon the fields with falling corps were strowd
      when once his falchion found the taste of blood
      with fury scarce to be conceivd he flew
      against niphaeus whom four coursers drew
      they when they see the fiery chief advance
      and pushing at their chests his pointed lance
      wheeld with so swift a motion mad with fear
      they threw their master headlong from the chair
      they stare they start nor stop their course before
      they bear the bounding chariot to the shore

      now lucagus and liger scour the plains
      with two white steeds but liger holds the reins
      and lucagus the lofty seat maintains
      bold brethren both the former wavd in air
      his flaming sword aeneas couchd his spear
      unusd to threats and more unusd to fear
      then liger thus thy confidence is vain
      to scape from hence as from the trojan plain
      nor these the steeds which diomede bestrode
      nor this the chariot where achilles rode
      nor venus veil is here near neptunes shield
      thy fatal hour is come and this the field
      thus liger vainly vaunts the trojan peer
      returnd his answer with his flying spear
      as lucagus to lash his horses bends
      prone to the wheels and his left foot protends
      prepard for fight the fatal dart arrives
      and thro the borders of his buckler drives
      passd thro and piercd his groin the deadly wound
      cast from his chariot rolld him on the ground
      whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite
      blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight
      vain shadows did not force their swift retreat
      but you yourself forsake your empty seat
      he said and seizd at once the loosend rein
      for liger lay already on the plain
      by the same shock then stretching out his hands
      the recreant thus his wretched life demands
      now by thyself o more than mortal man
      by her and him from whom thy breath began
      who formd thee thus divine i beg thee spare
      this forfeit life and hear thy suppliants prayr
      thus much he spoke and more he would have said
      but the stern hero turnd aside his head
      and cut him short i hear another man
      you talkd not thus before the fight began
      now take your turn and as a brother should
      attend your brother to the stygian flood
      then thro his breast his fatal sword he sent
      and the soul issued at the gaping vent

      as storms the skies and torrents tear the ground
      thus ragd the prince and scatterd deaths around
      at length ascanius and the trojan train
      broke from the camp so long besiegd in vain

      meantime the king of gods and mortal man
      held conference with his queen and thus began
      my sister goddess and wellpleasing wife
      still think you venus aid supports the strife
      sustains her trojansor themselves alone
      with inborn valour force their fortune on
      how fierce in fight with courage undecayd
      judge if such warriors want immortal aid
      to whom the goddess with the charming eyes
      soft in her tone submissively replies
      why o my sovreign lord whose frown i fear
      and cannot unconcernd your anger bear
      why urge you thus my grief when if i still
       were mistress of your will
      from your almighty powr your pleasing wife
      might gain the grace of lengthning turnus life
      securely snatch him from the fatal fight
      and give him to his aged fathers sight
      now let him perish since you hold it good
      and glut the trojans with his pious blood
      yet from our lineage he derives his name
      and in the fourth degree from god pilumnus came
      yet he devoutly pays you rites divine
      and offers daily incense at your shrine

      then shortly thus the sovreign god replied
      since in my powr and goodness you confide
      if for a little space a lengthend span
      you beg reprieve for this expiring man
      i grant you leave to take your turnus hence
      from instant fate and can so far dispense
      but if some secret meaning lies beneath
      to save the shortlivd youth from destind death
      or if a farther thought you entertain
      to change the fates you feed your hopes in vain
      to whom the goddess thus with weeping eyes
      and what if that request your tongue denies
      your heart should grant and not a short reprieve
      but length of certain life to turnus give
      now speedy death attends the guiltless youth
      if my presaging soul divines with truth
      which o i wish might err thro causeless fears
      and you  prolong his years

      thus having said involvd in clouds she flies
      and drives a storm before her thro the skies
      swift she descends alighting on the plain
      where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain
      of air condensd a spectre soon she made
      and what aeneas was such seemd the shade
      adornd with dardan arms the phantom bore
      his head aloft a plumy crest he wore
      this hand appeard a shining sword to wield
      and that sustaind an imitated shield
      with manly mien he stalkd along the ground
      nor wanted voice belied nor vaunting sound
      
      the spectre seems the daunian chief to dare
      and flourishes his empty sword in air
      at this advancing turnus hurld his spear
      the phantom wheeld and seemd to fly for fear
      deluded turnus thought the trojan fled
      and with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed
      whether o coward 
      why thus forsake your bride receive from me
      the fated land you sought so long by sea
      he said and brandishing at once his blade
      with eager pace pursued the flying shade
      by chance a ship was fastend to the shore
      which from old clusium king osinius bore
      the plank was ready laid for safe ascent
      for shelter there the trembling shadow bent
      and skippt and skulkd and under hatches went
      exulting turnus with regardless haste
      ascends the plank and to the galley passd
      scarce had he reachd the prow saturnias hand
      the haulsers cuts and shoots the ship from land
      with wind in poop the vessel plows the sea
      and measures back with speed her former way
      meantime aeneas seeks his absent foe
      and sends his slaughterd troops to shades below

      the guileful phantom now forsook the shroud
      and flew sublime and vanishd in a cloud
      too late young turnus the delusion found
      far on the sea still making from the ground
      then thankless for a life redeemd by shame
      with sense of honour stung and forfeit fame
      fearful besides of what in fight had passd
      his hands and haggard eyes to heavn he cast
      o jove he cried for what offence have i
      deservd to bear this endless infamy
      whence am i forcd and whether am i borne
      how and with what reproach shall i return
      shall ever i behold the latian plain
      or see laurentums lofty towrs again
      what will they say of their deserting chief
      the war was mine i fly from their relief
      i led to slaughter and in slaughter leave
      and evn from hence their dying groans receive
      here overmatchd in fight in heaps they lie
      there scatterd oer the fields ignobly fly
      gape wide o earth and draw me down alive
      or o ye pitying winds a wretch relieve
      on sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive
      or set me shipwreckd on some desert shore
      where no rutulian eyes may see me more
      unknown to friends or foes or conscious fame
      lest she should follow and my flight proclaim

      thus turnus ravd and various fates revolvd
      the choice was doubtful but the death resolvd
      and now the sword and now the sea took place
      that to revenge and this to purge disgrace
      sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main
      by stretch of arms the distant shore to gain
      thrice he the sword assayd and thrice the flood
      but juno movd with pity both withstood
      and thrice repressd his rage strong gales supplied
      and pushd the vessel oer the swelling tide
      at length she lands him on his native shores
      and to his fathers longing arms restores

      meantime by joves impulse mezentius armd
      succeeding turnus with his ardour warmd
      his fainting friends reproachd their shameful flight
      repelld the victors and renewd the fight
      against their king the tuscan troops conspire
      such is their hate and such their fierce desire
      of wishd revenge on him and him alone
      all hands employd and all their darts are thrown
      he like a solid rock by seas inclosd
      to raging winds and roaring waves opposd
      from his proud summit looking down disdains
      their empty menace and unmovd remains

      beneath his feet fell haughty hebrus dead
      then latagus and palmus as he fled
      at latagus a weighty stone he flung
      his face was flatted and his helmet rung
      but palmus from behind receives his wound
      hamstringd he falls and grovels on the ground
      his crest and armour from his body torn
      thy shoulders lausus and thy head adorn
      evas and mimas both of troy he slew
      mimas his birth from fair theano drew
      born on that fatal night when big with fire
      the queen producd young paris to his sire
      but paris in the phrygian fields was slain
      unthinking mimas on the latian plain

      and as a savage boar on mountains bred
      with forest mast and fattning marshes fed
      when once he sees himself in toils inclosd
      by huntsmen and their eager hounds opposd
      he whets his tusks and turns and dares the war
      th invaders dart their javlins from afar
      all keep aloof and safely shout around
      but none presumes to give a nearer wound
      he frets and froths erects his bristled hide
      and shakes a grove of lances from his side
      not otherwise the troops with hate inspird
      and just revenge against the tyrant fird
      their darts with clamour at a distance drive
      and only keep the languishd war alive

      from coritus came acron to the fight
      who left his spouse betrothd and unconsummate night
      mezentius sees him thro the squadrons ride
      proud of the purple favours of his bride
      then as a hungry lion who beholds
      a gamesome goat who frisks about the folds
      or beamy stag that grazes on the plain
      he runs he roars he shakes his rising mane
      he grins and opens wide his greedy jaws
      the prey lies panting underneath his paws
      he fills his famishd maw his mouth runs oer
      with unchewd morsels while he churns the gore
      so proud mezentius rushes on his foes
      and first unhappy acron overthrows
      stretchd at his length he spurns the swarthy ground
      the lance besmeard with blood lies broken in the wound
      then with disdain the haughty victor viewd
      orodes flying nor the wretch pursued
      nor thought the dastards back deservd a wound
      but running gaind th advantage of the ground
      then turning short he met him face to face
      to give his victory the better grace
      orodes falls in equal fight oppressd
      mezentius fixd his foot upon his breast
      and rested lance and thus aloud he cries
      lo here the champion of my rebels lies
      the fields around with io paean ring
      and peals of shouts applaud the conquring king
      at this the vanquishd with his dying breath
      thus faintly spoke and prophesied in death
      nor thou proud man unpunishd shalt remain
      like death attends thee on this fatal plain
      then sourly smiling thus the king replied
      for what belongs to me let jove provide
      but die thou first whatever chance ensue
      he said and from the wound the weapon drew
      a hovring mist came swimming oer his sight
      and seald his eyes in everlasting night

      by caedicus alcathous was slain
      sacrator laid hydaspes on the plain
      orses the strong to greater strength must yield
      he with parthenius were by rapo killd
      then brave messapus ericetes slew
      who from lycaons blood his lineage drew
      but from his headstrong horse his fate he found
      who threw his master as he made a bound
      the chief alighting stuck him to the ground
      then clonius hand to hand on foot assails
      the trojan sinks and neptunes son prevails
      agis the lycian stepping forth with pride
      to single fight the boldest foe defied
      whom tuscan valerus by force oercame
      and not belied his mighty fathers fame
      salius to death the great antronius sent
      but the same fate the victor underwent
      slain by nealces hand wellskilld to throw
      the flying dart and draw the fardeceiving bow

      thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance
      by turns they quit their ground by turns advance
      victors and vanquishd in the various field
      nor wholly overcome nor wholly yield
      the gods from heavn survey the fatal strife
      and mourn the miseries of human life
      above the rest two goddesses appear
      concernd for each here venus juno there
      amidst the crowd infernal ate shakes
      her scourge aloft and crest of hissing snakes

      once more the proud mezentius with disdain
      brandishd his spear and rushd into the plain
      where towring in the midmost rank he stood
      like tall orion stalking oer the flood
      
      or like a mountain ash whose roots are spread
      deep fixd in earth in clouds he hides his head

      the trojan prince beheld him from afar
      and dauntless undertook the doubtful war
      collected in his strength and like a rock
      poisd on his base mezentius stood the shock
      he stood and measuring first with careful eyes
      the space his spear could reach aloud he cries
      my strong right hand and sword assist my stroke
      
      his armour from the trojan pirate torn
      by my triumphant lausus shall be worn
      he said and with his utmost force he threw
      the massy spear which hissing as it flew
      reachd the celestial shield that stoppd the course
      but glancing thence the yet unbroken force
      took a new bent obliquely and betwixt
      the side and bowels famd anthores fixd
      anthores had from argos traveld far
      alcides friend and brother of the war
      till tird with toils fair italy he chose
      and in evanders palace sought repose
      now falling by anothers wound his eyes
      he cast to heavn on argos thinks and dies

      the pious trojan then his javlin sent
      the shield gave way thro treble plates it went
      of solid brass of linen trebly rolld
      and three bull hides which round the buckler fold
      all these it passd resistless in the course
      transpiercd his thigh and spent its dying force
      the gaping wound gushd out a crimson flood
      the trojan glad with sight of hostile blood
      his falchion drew to closer fight addressd
      and with new force his fainting foe oppressd

      his fathers peril lausus viewd with grief
      he sighd he wept he ran to his relief
      and here heroic youth tis here i must
      to thy immortal memory be just
      and sing an act so noble and so new
      posterity will scarce believe tis true
      paind with his wound and useless for the fight
      the father sought to save himself by flight
      encumberd slow he draggd the spear along
      which piercd his thigh and in his buckler hung
      the pious youth resolvd on death below
      the lifted sword springs forth to face the foe
      protects his parent and prevents the blow
      shouts of applause ran ringing thro the field
      to see the son the vanquishd father shield
      all fird with genrous indignation strive
      and with a storm of darts to distance drive
      the trojan chief who held at bay from far
      on his vulcanian orb sustaind the war

      as when thick hail comes rattling in the wind
      the plowman passenger and labring hind
      for shelter to the neighbring covert fly
      or housd or safe in hollow caverns lie
      but that oerblown when heavn above em smiles
      return to travel and renew their toils
      aeneas thus oerwhelmed on evry side
      the storm of darts undaunted did abide
      and thus to lausus loud with friendly threatning cried
      why wilt thou rush to certain death and rage
      in rash attempts beyond thy tender age
      betrayd by pious love nor thus forborne
      the youth desists but with insulting scorn
      provokes the lingring prince whose patience tird
      gave place and all his breast with fury fird
      for now the fates prepard their sharpend shears
      and lifted high the flaming sword appears
      which full descending with a frightful sway
      thro shield and corslet forcd th impetuous way
      and buried deep in his fair bosom lay
      the purple streams thro the thin armour strove
      and drenchd th imbroiderd coat his mother wove
      and life at length forsook his heaving heart
      loth from so sweet a mansion to depart

      but when with blood and paleness all oerspread
      the pious prince beheld young lausus dead
      he grievd he wept the sight an image brought
      of his own filial love a sadly pleasing thought
      then stretchd his hand to hold him up and said
      poor hapless youth what praises can be paid
      to love so great to such transcendent store
      of early worth and sure presage of more
      accept whateer aeneas can afford
      untouchd thy arms untaken be thy sword
      and all that pleasd thee living still remain
      inviolate and sacred to the slain
      thy body on thy parents i bestow
      to rest thy soul at least if shadows know
      or have a sense of human things below
      there to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell
      twas by the great aeneas hand i fell
      with this his distant friends he beckons near
      provokes their duty and prevents their fear
      himself assists to lift him from the ground
      with clotted locks and blood that welld from out the wound

      meantime his father now no father stood
      and washd his wounds by tibers yellow flood
      oppressd with anguish panting and oerspent
      his fainting limbs against an oak he leant
      a bough his brazen helmet did sustain
      his heavier arms lay scatterd on the plain
      a chosen train of youth around him stand
      his drooping head was rested on his hand
      his grisly beard his pensive bosom sought
      and all on lausus ran his restless thought
      careful concernd his danger to prevent
      he much enquird and many a message sent
      to warn him from the fieldalas in vain
      behold his mournful followers bear him slain
      oer his broad shield still gushd the yawning wound
      and drew a bloody trail along the ground
      far off he heard their cries far off divind
      the dire event with a foreboding mind
      with dust he sprinkled first his hoary head
      then both his lifted hands to heavn he spread
      last the dear corpse embracing thus he said
      what joys alas could this frail being give
      that i have been so covetous to live
      to see my son and such a son resign
      his life a ransom for preserving mine
      and am i then preservd and art thou lost
      how much too dear has that redemption cost
      tis now my bitter banishment i feel
      this is a wound too deep for time to heal
      my guilt thy growing virtues did defame
      my blackness blotted thy unblemishd name
      chasd from a throne abandond and exild
      for foul misdeeds were punishments too mild
      i owd my people these and from their hate
      with less resentment could have borne my fate
      and yet i live and yet sustain the sight
      of hated men and of more hated light
      but will not long with that he raisd from ground
      his fainting limbs that staggerd with his wound
      yet with a mind resolvd and unappalld
      with pains or perils for his courser calld
      wellmouthd wellmanagd whom himself did dress
      with daily care and mounted with success
      his aid in arms his ornament in peace

      soothing his courage with a gentle stroke
      the steed seemd sensible while thus he spoke
      o rhoebus we have livd too long for me
      if life and long were terms that could agree
      this day thou either shalt bring back the head
      and bloody trophies of the trojan dead
      this day thou either shalt revenge my woe
      for murderd lausus on his cruel foe
      or if inexorable fate deny
      our conquest with thy conquerd master die
      for after such a lord i rest secure
      thou wilt no foreign reins or trojan load endure
      he said and straight th officious courser kneels
      to take his wonted weight his hands he fills
      with pointed javlins on his head he lacd
      his glittring helm which terribly was gracd
      with waving horsehair nodding from afar
      then spurrd his thundring steed amidst the war
      love anguish wrath and grief to madness wrought
      despair and secret shame and conscious thought
      of inborn worth his labring soul oppressd
      rolld in his eyes and ragd within his breast
      then loud he calld aeneas thrice by name
      the loud repeated voice to glad aeneas came
      great jove he said and the farshooting god
      inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good
      he spoke no more but hastend void of fear
      and threatend with his long protended spear

      to whom mezentius thus thy vaunts are vain
      my lausus lies extended on the plain
      hes lost thy conquest is already won
      the wretched sire is murderd in the son
      nor fate i fear but all the gods defy
      forbear thy threats my busness is to die
      but first receive this parting legacy
      he said and straight a whirling dart he sent
      another after and another went
      round in a spacious ring he rides the field
      and vainly plies th impenetrable shield
      thrice rode he round and thrice aeneas wheeld
      turnd as he turnd the golden orb withstood
      the strokes and bore about an iron wood
      impatient of delay and weary grown
      still to defend and to defend alone
      to wrench the darts which in his buckler light
      urgd and oerlabourd in unequal fight
      at length resolvd he throws with all his force
      full at the temples of the warrior horse
      just where the stroke was aimd th unerring spear
      made way and stood transfixd thro either ear
      seizd with unwonted pain surprisd with fright
      the wounded steed curvets and raisd upright
      lights on his feet before his hoofs behind
      spring up in air aloft and lash the wind
      down comes the rider headlong from his height
      his horse came after with unwieldy weight
      and floundring forward pitching on his head
      his lords encumberd shoulder overlaid

      from either host the mingled shouts and cries
      of trojans and rutulians rend the skies
      aeneas hastning wavd his fatal sword
      high oer his head with this reproachful word
      now where are now thy vaunts the fierce disdain
      of proud mezentius and the lofty strain

      struggling and wildly staring on the skies
      with scarce recoverd sight he thus replies
      why these insulting words this waste of breath
      to souls undaunted and secure of death
      tis no dishonour for the brave to die
      nor came i here with hope of victory
      nor ask i life nor fought with that design
      as i had usd my fortune use thou thine
      my dying son contracted no such band
      the gift is hateful from his murdrers hand
      for this this only favour let me sue
      if pity can to conquerd foes be due
      refuse it not but let my body have
      the last retreat of humankind a grave
      too well i know th insulting peoples hate
      protect me from their vengeance after fate
      this refuge for my poor remains provide
      and lay my muchlovd lausus by my side
      he said and to the sword his throat applied
      the crimson stream distaind his arms around
      and the disdainful soul came rushing thro the wound




      scarce had the rosy morning raisd her head
      above the waves and left her watry bed
      the pious chief whom double cares attend
      for his unburied soldiers and his friend
      yet first to heavn performd a victors vows
      he bard an ancient oak of all her boughs
      then on a rising ground the trunk he placd
      which with the spoils of his dead foe he gracd
      the coat of arms by proud mezentius worn
      now on a naked snag in triumph borne
      was hung on high and glitterd from afar
      a trophy sacred to the god of war
      above his arms fixd on the leafless wood
      appeard his plumy crest besmeard with blood
      his brazen buckler on the left was seen
      truncheons of shiverd lances hung between
      and on the right was placed his corslet bord
      and to the neck was tied his unavailing sword

      a crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man
      who thus conspicuous in the midst began
      our toils my friends are crownd with sure success
      the greater part performd achieve the less
      now follow cheerful to the trembling town
      press but an entrance and presume it won
      fear is no more for fierce mezentius lies
      as the first fruits of war a sacrifice
      turnus shall fall extended on the plain
      and in this omen is already slain
      prepard in arms pursue your happy chance
      that none unwarnd may plead his ignorance
      and i at heavns appointed hour may find
      your warlike ensigns waving in the wind
      meantime the rites and funral pomps prepare
      due to your dead companions of the war
      the last respect the living can bestow
      to shield their shadows from contempt below
      that conquerd earth be theirs for which they fought
      and which for us with their own blood they bought
      but first the corpse of our unhappy friend
      to the sad city of evander send
      who not inglorious in his ages bloom
      was hurried hence by too severe a doom

      thus weeping while he spoke he took his way
      where new in death lamented pallas lay
      acoetes watchd the corpse whose youth deservd
      the fathers trust and now the son he servd
      with equal faith but less auspicious care
      th attendants of the slain his sorrow share
      a troop of trojans mixd with these appear
      and mourning matrons with disheveld hair
      soon as the prince appears they raise a cry
      all beat their breasts and echoes rend the sky
      they rear his drooping forehead from the ground
      but when aeneas viewd the grisly wound
      which pallas in his manly bosom bore
      and the fair flesh distaind with purple gore
      first melting into tears the pious man
      deplord so sad a sight then thus began
      unhappy youth when fortune gave the rest
      of my full wishes she refusd the best
      she came but brought not thee along to bless
      my longing eyes and share in my success
      she grudgd thy safe return the triumphs due
      to prosprous valour in the public view
      not thus i promisd when thy father lent
      thy needless succour with a sad consent
      embracd me parting for th etrurian land
      and sent me to possess a large command
      he warnd and from his own experience told
      our foes were warlike disciplind and bold
      and now perhaps in hopes of thy return
      rich odors on his loaded altars burn
      while we with vain officious pomp prepare
      to send him back his portion of the war
      a bloody breathless body which can owe
      no farther debt but to the powrs below
      the wretched father ere his race is run
      shall view the funral honours of his son
      these are my triumphs of the latian war
      fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care
      and yet unhappy sire thou shalt not see
      a son whose death disgracd his ancestry
      thou shalt not blush old man however grievd
      thy pallas no dishonest wound receivd
      he died no death to make thee wish too late
      thou hadst not livd to see his shameful fate
      but what a champion has th ausonian coast
      and what a friend hast thou ascanius lost

      thus having mournd he gave the word around
      to raise the breathless body from the ground
      and chose a thousand horse the flowr of all
      his warlike troops to wait the funeral
      to bear him back and share evanders grief
      a wellbecoming but a weak relief
      of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier
      then on their shoulders the sad burden rear
      the body on this rural hearse is borne
      strewd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn
      all pale he lies and looks a lovely flowr
      new croppd by virgin hands to dress the bowr
      unfaded yet but yet unfed below
      no more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe
      then two fair vests of wondrous work and cost
      of purple woven and with gold embossd
      for ornament the trojan hero brought
      which with her hands sidonian dido wrought
      one vest arrayd the corpse and one they spread
      oer his closd eyes and wrappd around his head
      that when the yellow hair in flame should fall
      the catching fire might burn the golden caul
      besides the spoils of foes in battle slain
      when he descended on the latian plain
      arms trappings horses by the hearse are led
      in long arrayth achievements of the dead
      then piniond with their hands behind appear
      th unhappy captives marching in the rear
      appointed offrings in the victors name
      to sprinkle with their blood the funral flame
      inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne
      gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn
      and fair inscriptions fixd and titles read
      of latian leaders conquerd by the dead

      acoetes on his pupils corpse attends
      with feeble steps supported by his friends
      pausing at evry pace in sorrow drownd
      betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground
      where grovling while he lies in deep despair
      he beats his breast and rends his hoary hair
      the champions chariot next is seen to roll
      besmeard with hostile blood and honourably foul
      to close the pomp aethon the steed of state
      is led the funrals of his lord to wait
      strippd of his trappings with a sullen pace
      he walks and the big tears run rolling down his face
      the lance of pallas and the crimson crest
      are borne behind the victor seizd the rest
      the march begins the trumpets hoarsely sound
      the pikes and lances trail along the ground
      thus while the trojan and arcadian horse
      to pallantean towrs direct their course
      in long procession rankd the pious chief
      stoppd in the rear and gave a vent to grief
      the public care he said which war attends
      diverts our present woes at least suspends
      peace with the manes of great pallas dwell
      hail holy relics and a last farewell
      he said no more but inly thro he mournd
      restrained his tears and to the camp returnd

      now suppliants from laurentum sent demand
      a truce with olive branches in their hand
      obtest his clemency and from the plain
      beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain
      they plead that none those common rites deny
      to conquerd foes that in fair battle die
      all cause of hate was ended in their death
      nor could he war with bodies void of breath
      a king they hopd would hear a kings request
      whose son he once was calld and once his guest

      their suit which was too just to be denied
      the hero grants and farther thus replied
      o latian princes how severe a fate
      in causeless quarrels has involvd your state
      and armd against an unoffending man
      who sought your friendship ere the war began
      you beg a truce which i would gladly give
      not only for the slain but those who live
      i came not hither but by heavns command
      and sent by fate to share the latian land
      nor wage i wars unjust your king denied
      my profferd friendship and my promisd bride
      left me for turnus turnus then should try
      his cause in arms to conquer or to die
      my right and his are in dispute the slain
      fell without fault our quarrel to maintain
      in equal arms let us alone contend
      and let him vanquish whom his fates befriend
      this is the way  to possess
      the royal virgin and restore the peace
      bear this message back with ample leave
      that your slain friends may funral rites receive

      thus having saidth embassadors amazd
      stood mute a while and on each other gazd
      drances their chief who harbourd in his breast
      long hate to turnus as his foe professd
      broke silence first and to the godlike man
      with graceful action bowing thus began
      auspicious prince in arms a mighty name
      but yet whose actions far transcend your fame
      would i your justice or your force express
      thought can but equal and all words are less
      your answer we shall thankfully relate
      and favours granted to the latian state
      if wishd success our labour shall attend
      think peace concluded and the king your friend
      let turnus leave the realm to your command
      and seek alliance in some other land
      build you the city which your fates assign
      we shall be proud in the great work to join

      thus drances and his words so well persuade
      the rest impowerd that soon a truce is made
      twelve days the term allowd and during those
      latians and trojans now no longer foes
      mixd in the woods for funral piles prepare
      to fell the timber and forget the war
      loud axes thro the groaning groves resound
      oak mountain ash and poplar spread the ground
      first fall from high and some the trunks receive
      in loaden wains with wedges some they cleave

      and now the fatal news by fame is blown
      thro the short circuit of th arcadian town
      of pallas slainby fame which just before
      his triumphs on distended pinions bore
      rushing from out the gate the people stand
      each with a funral flambeau in his hand
      wildly they stare distracted with amaze
      the fields are lightend with a fiery blaze
      that cast a sullen splendour on their friends
      the marching troop which their dead prince attends
      both parties meet they raise a doleful cry
      the matrons from the walls with shrieks reply
      and their mixd mourning rends the vaulted sky
      the town is filld with tumult and with tears
      till the loud clamours reach evanders ears
      forgetful of his state he runs along
      with a disorderd pace and cleaves the throng
      falls on the corpse and groaning there he lies
      with silent grief that speaks but at his eyes
      short sighs and sobs succeed till sorrow breaks
      a passage and at once he weeps and speaks

      o pallas thou hast faild thy plighted word
      to fight with caution not to tempt the sword
      i warnd thee but in vain for well i knew
      what perils youthful ardour would pursue
      that boiling blood would carry thee too far
      young as thou wert in dangers raw to war
      o curst essay of arms disastrous doom
      prelude of bloody fields and fights to come
      hard elements of unauspicious war
      vain vows to heavn and unavailing care
      thrice happy thou dear partner of my bed
      whose holy soul the stroke of fortune fled
      prescious of ills and leaving me behind
      to drink the dregs of life by fate assignd
      beyond the goal of nature i have gone
      my pallas late set out but reachd too soon
      if for my league against th ausonian state
      amidst their weapons i had found my fate
       then i had been returnd
      a breathless victor and my son had mournd
      yet will i not my trojan friend upbraid
      nor grudge th alliance i so gladly made
      twas not his fault my pallas fell so young
      but my own crime for having livd too long
      yet since the gods had destind him to die
      at least he led the way to victory
      first for his friends he won the fatal shore
      and sent whole herds of slaughterd foes before
      a death too great too glorious to deplore
      nor will i add new honours to thy grave
      content with those the trojan hero gave
      that funeral pomp thy phrygian friends designd
      in which the tuscan chiefs and army joind
      great spoils and trophies gaind by thee they bear
      then let thy own achievements be thy share
      even thou o turnus hadst a trophy stood
      whose mighty trunk had better gracd the wood
      if pallas had arrivd with equal length
      of years to match thy bulk with equal strength
      but why unhappy man dost thou detain
      these troops to view the tears thou sheddst in vain
      go friends this message to your lord relate
      tell him that if i bear my bitter fate
      and after pallas death live lingring on
      tis to behold his vengeance for my son
      i stay for turnus whose devoted head
      is owing to the living and the dead
      my son and i expect it from his hand
      tis all that he can give or we demand
      joy is no more but i would gladly go
      to greet my pallas with such news below

      the morn had now dispelld the shades of night
      restoring toils when she restord the light
      the trojan king and tuscan chief command
      to raise the piles along the winding strand
      their friends convey the dead funral fires
      black smouldring smoke from the green wood expires
      the light of heavn is chokd and the new day retires
      then thrice around the kindled piles they go
      
      thrice horse and foot about the fires are led
      and thrice with loud laments they hail the dead
      tears trickling down their breasts bedew the ground
      and drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound
      amid the blaze their pious brethren throw
      the spoils in battle taken from the foe
      helms bits embossd and swords of shining steel
      one casts a target one a chariot wheel
      some to their fellows their own arms restore
      the falchions which in luckless fight they bore
      their bucklers piercd their darts bestowd in vain
      and shiverd lances gatherd from the plain
      whole herds of offerd bulls about the fire
      and bristled boars and woolly sheep expire
      around the piles a careful troop attends
      to watch the wasting flames and weep their burning friends
      lingring along the shore till dewy night
      new decks the face of heavn with starry light

      the conquerd latians with like pious care
      piles without number for their dead prepare
      part in the places where they fell are laid
      and part are to the neighbring fields conveyd
      the corps of kings and captains of renown
      borne off in state are buried in the town
      the rest unhonourd and without a name
      are cast a common heap to feed the flame
      trojans and latians vie with like desires
      to make the field of battle shine with fires
      and the promiscuous blaze to heavn aspires

      now had the morning thrice renewd the light
      and thrice dispelld the shadows of the night
      when those who round the wasted fires remain
      perform the last sad office to the slain
      they rake the yet warm ashes from below
      these and the bones unburnd in earth bestow
      these relics with their country rites they grace
      and raise a mount of turf to mark the place

      but in the palace of the king appears
      a scene more solemn and a pomp of tears
      maids matrons widows mix their common moans
      orphans their sires and sires lament their sons
      all in that universal sorrow share
      and curse the cause of this unhappy war
      a broken league a bride unjustly sought
      a crown usurpd which with their blood is bought
      these are the crimes with which they load the name
      of turnus and on him alone exclaim
      let him who lords it oer th ausonian land
      engage the trojan hero hand to hand
      his is the gain our lot is but to serve
      tis just the sway he seeks he should deserve
      this drances aggravates and adds with spite
      his foe expects and dares him to the fight
      nor turnus wants a party to support
      his cause and credit in the latian court
      his former acts secure his present fame
      and the queen shades him with her mighty name

      while thus their factious minds with fury burn
      the legates from th aetolian prince return
      sad news they bring that after all the cost
      and care employd their embassy is lost
      that diomedes refusd his aid in war
      unmovd with presents and as deaf to prayr
      some new alliance must elsewhere be sought
      or peace with troy on hard conditions bought

      latinus sunk in sorrow finds too late
      a foreign son is pointed out by fate
      and till aeneas shall lavinia wed
      the wrath of heavn is hovring oer his head
      the gods he saw espousd the juster side
      when late their titles in the field were tried
      witness the fresh laments and funral tears undried
      thus full of anxious thought he summons all
      the latian senate to the council hall
      the princes come commanded by their head
      and crowd the paths that to the palace lead
      supreme in powr and reverencd for his years
      he takes the throne and in the midst appears
      majestically sad he sits in state
      and bids his envoys their success relate

      when venulus began the murmuring sound
      was hushd and sacred silence reignd around
      we have said he performd your high command
      and passd with peril a long tract of land
      we reachd the place desird with wonder filld
      the grecian tents and rising towrs beheld
      great diomede has compassd round with walls
      the city which argyripa he calls
      from his own argos namd we touchd with joy
      the royal hand that razd unhappy troy
      when introducd our presents first we bring
      then crave an instant audience from the king
      his leave obtaind our native soil we name
      and tell th important cause for which we came
      attentively he heard us while we spoke
      then with soft accents and a pleasing look
      made this return ausonian race of old
      renownd for peace and for an age of gold
      what madness has your alterd minds possessd
      to change for war hereditary rest
      solicit arms unknown and tempt the sword
      a needless ill your ancestors abhorrd
      wefor myself i speak and all the name
      of grecians who to troys destruction came
      
      not one but sufferd and too dearly bought
      the prize of honour which in arms he sought
      some doomd to death and some in exile drivn
      outcasts abandond by the care of heavn
      so worn so wretched so despisd a crew
      as evn old priam might with pity view
      witness the vessels by minerva tossd
      in storms the vengeful capharean coast
      th euboean rocks the prince whose brother led
      our armies to revenge his injurd bed
      in egypt lost ulysses with his men
      have seen charybdis and the cyclops den
      why should i name idomeneus in vain
      restord to scepters and expelld again
      or young achilles by his rival slain
      evn he the king of men the foremost name
      of all the greeks and most renownd by fame
      the proud revenger of anothers wife
      yet by his own adultress lost his life
      fell at his threshold and the spoils of troy
      the foul polluters of his bed enjoy
      the gods have envied me the sweets of life
      my much lovd country and my more lovd wife
      banishd from both i mourn while in the sky
      transformd to birds my lost companions fly
      hovring about the coasts they make their moan
      and cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own
      what squalid spectres in the dead of night
      break my short sleep and skim before my sight
      i might have promisd to myself those harms
      mad as i was when i with mortal arms
      presumd against immortal powrs to move
      and violate with wounds the queen of love
      such arms this hand shall never more employ
      no hate remains with me to ruind troy
      i war not with its dust nor am i glad
      to think of past events or good or bad
      your presents i return whateer you bring
      to buy my friendship send the trojan king
      we met in fight i know him to my cost
      with what a whirling force his lance he tossd
      heavns what a spring was in his arm to throw
      how high he held his shield and rose at evry blow
      had troy producd two more his match in might
      they would have changd the fortune of the fight
      th invasion of the greeks had been returnd
      our empire wasted and our cities burnd
      the long defence the trojan people made
      the war protracted and the siege delayd
      were due to hectors and this heros hand
      both brave alike and equal in command
      aeneas not inferior in the field
      in pious reverence to the gods excelld
      make peace ye latians and avoid with care
      th impending dangers of a fatal war
      he said no more but with this cold excuse
      refusd th alliance and advisd a truce

      thus venulus concluded his report
      a jarring murmur filld the factious court
      as when a torrent rolls with rapid force
      and dashes oer the stones that stop the course
      the flood constraind within a scanty space
      roars horrible along th uneasy race
      white foam in gathring eddies floats around
      the rocky shores rebellow to the sound

      the murmur ceasd then from his lofty throne
      the king invokd the gods and thus begun
      i wish ye latins what we now debate
      had been resolvd before it was too late
      much better had it been for you and me
      unforcd by this our last necessity
      to have been earlier wise than now to call
      a council when the foe surrounds the wall
      o citizens we wage unequal war
      with men not only heavns peculiar care
      but heavns own race unconquerd in the field
      or conquerd yet unknowing how to yield
      what hopes you had in diomedes lay down
      our hopes must centre on ourselves alone
      yet those how feeble and indeed how vain
      you see too well nor need my words explain
      vanquishd without resource laid flat by fate
      factions within a foe without the gate
      not but i grant that all performd their parts
      with manly force and with undaunted hearts
      with our united strength the war we wagd
      with equal numbers equal arms engagd
      you see th eventnow hear what i propose
      to save our friends and satisfy our foes
      a tract of land the latins have possessd
      along the tiber stretching to the west
      which now rutulians and auruncans till
      and their mixd cattle graze the fruitful hill
      those mountains filld with firs that lower land
      if you consent the trojan shall command
      calld into part of what is ours and there
      on terms agreed the common country share
      there let them build and settle if they please
      unless they choose once more to cross the seas
      in search of seats remote from italy
      and from unwelcome inmates set us free
      then twice ten galleys let us build with speed
      or twice as many more if more they need
      materials are at hand a wellgrown wood
      runs equal with the margin of the flood
      let them the number and the form assign
      the care and cost of all the stores be mine
      to treat the peace a hundred senators
      shall be commissiond hence with ample powrs
      with olive the presents they shall bear
      a purple robe a royal ivry chair
      and all the marks of sway that latian monarchs wear
      and sums of gold among yourselves debate
      this great affair and save the sinking state

      then drances took the word who grudgd long since
      the rising glories of the daunian prince
      factious and rich bold at the council board
      but cautious in the field he shunnd the sword
      a close caballer and tonguevaliant lord
      noble his mother was and near the throne
      but what his fathers parentage unknown
      he rose and took th advantage of the times
      to load young turnus with invidious crimes
      such truths o king said he your words contain
      as strike the sense and all replies are vain
      nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
      what common needs require but fear to speak
      let him give leave of speech that haughty man
      whose pride this unauspicious war began
      for whose ambition 
      the plains of latium run with blood around
      so many valiant heroes bite the ground
      dejected grief in evry face appears
      a town in mourning and a land in tears
      while he th undoubted author of our harms
      the man who menaces the gods with arms
      yet after all his boasts forsook the fight
      and sought his safety in ignoble flight
      now best of kings since you propose to send
      such bounteous presents to your trojan friend
      add yet a greater at our joint request
      one which he values more than all the rest
      give him the fair lavinia for his bride
      with that alliance let the league be tied
      and for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide
      let insolence no longer awe the throne
      but with a fathers right bestow your own
      for this maligner of the general good
      if still we fear his force he must be wood
      his haughty godhead we with prayrs implore
      your scepter to release and our just rights restore
      o cursed cause of all our ills must we
      wage wars unjust and fall in fight for thee
      what right hast thou to rule the latian state
      and send us out to meet our certain fate
      tis a destructive war from turnus hand
      our peace and public safety we demand
      let the fair bride to the brave chief remain
      if not the peace without the pledge is vain
      turnus i know you think me not your friend
      nor will i much with your belief contend
      i beg your greatness not to give the law
      in others realms but beaten to withdraw
      pity your own or pity our estate
      nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate
      your interest is the war should never cease
      but we have felt enough to wish the peace
      a land exhausted to the last remains
      depopulated towns and driven plains
      yet if desire of fame and thirst of powr
      a beauteous princess with a crown in dowr
      so fire your mind in arms assert your right
      and meet your foe who dares you to the fight
      mankind it seems is made for you alone
      we but the slaves who mount you to the throne
      a base ignoble crowd without a name
      unwept unworthy of the funral flame
      by duty bound to forfeit each his life
      that turnus may possess a royal wife
      permit not mighty man so mean a crew
      should share such triumphs and detain from you
      the post of honour your undoubted due
      rather alone your matchless force employ
      to merit what alone you must enjoy

      these words so full of malice mixd with art
      inflamd with rage the youthful heros heart
      then groaning from the bottom of his breast
      he heavd for wind and thus his wrath expressd
      you drances never want a stream of words
      then when the public need requires our swords
      first in the council hall to steer the state
      and ever foremost in a tonguedebate
      while our strong walls secure us from the foe
      ere yet with blood our ditches overflow
      but let the potent orator declaim
      and with the brand of coward blot my name
      free leave is givn him when his fatal hand
      has coverd with more corps the sanguine strand
      and high as mine his towring trophies stand
      if any doubt remains who dares the most
      let us decide it at the trojans cost
      and issue both abreast where honour calls
      
      unless his noisy tongue can only fight
      and feet were givn him but to speed his flight
      i beaten from the field i forcd away
      who but so known a dastard dares to say
      had he but evn beheld the fight his eyes
      had witnessd for me what his tongue denies
      what heaps of trojans by this hand were slain
      and how the bloody tiber swelld the main
      all saw but he th arcadian troops retire
      in scatterd squadrons and their prince expire
      the giant brothers in their camp have found
      i was not forcd with ease to quit my ground
      not such the trojans tried me when inclosd
      i singly their united arms opposd
      first forcd an entrance thro their thick array
      then glutted with their slaughter freed my way
      tis a destructive war so let it be
      but to the phrygian pirate and to thee
      meantime proceed to fill the peoples ears
      with false reports their minds with panic fears
      extol the strength of a twiceconquerd race
      our foes encourage and our friends debase
      believe thy fables and the trojan town
      triumphant stands the grecians are oerthrown
      suppliant at hectors feet achilles lies
      and diomede from fierce aeneas flies
      say rapid aufidus with awful dread
      runs backward from the sea and hides his head
      when the great trojan on his bank appears
      for thats as true as thy dissembled fears
      of my revenge dismiss that vanity
      thou drances art below a death from me
      let that vile soul in that vile body rest
      the lodging is well worthy of the guest

      now royal father to the present state
      of our affairs and of this high debate
      if in your arms thus early you diffide
      and think your fortune is already tried
      if one defeat has brought us down so low
      as never more in fields to meet the foe
      then i conclude for peace tis time to treat
      and lie like vassals at the victors feet
      but o if any ancient blood remains
      one drop of all our fathers in our veins
      that man would i prefer before the rest
      who dard his death with an undaunted breast
      who comely fell by no dishonest wound
      to shun that sight and dying gnawd the ground
      but if we still have fresh recruits in store
      if our confederates can afford us more
      if the contended field we bravely fought
      and not a bloodless victory was bought
      their losses equald ours and for their slain
      with equal fires they filld the shining plain
      why thus unforcd should we so tamely yield
      and ere the trumpet sounds resign the field
      good unexpected evils unforeseen
      appear by turns as fortune shifts the scene
      some raisd aloft come tumbling down amain
      then fall so hard they bound and rise again
      if diomede refuse his aid to lend
      the great messapus yet remains our friend
      tolumnius who foretells events is ours
      th italian chiefs and princes join their powrs
      nor least in number nor in name the last
      your own brave subjects have your cause embracd
      above the rest the volscian amazon
      contains an army in herself alone
      and heads a squadron terrible to sight
      with glittring shields in brazen armour bright
      yet if the foe a single fight demand
      and i alone the public peace withstand
      if you consent he shall not be refusd
      nor find a hand to victory unusd
      this new achilles let him take the field
      with fated armour and vulcanian shield
      for you my royal father and my fame
      i turnus not the least of all my name
      devote my soul he calls me hand to hand
      and i alone will answer his demand
      drances shall rest secure and neither share
      the danger nor divide the prize of war

      while they debate nor these nor those will yield
      aeneas draws his forces to the field
      and moves his camp the scouts with flying speed
      return and thro the frighted city spread
      th unpleasing news the trojans are descried
      in battle marching by the river side
      and bending to the town they take th alarm
      some tremble some are bold all in confusion arm
      th impetuous youth press forward to the field
      they clash the sword and clatter on the shield
      the fearful matrons raise a screaming cry
      old feeble men with fainter groans reply
      a jarring sound results and mingles in the sky
      like that of swans remurmring to the floods
      or birds of diffring kinds in hollow woods

      turnus th occasion takes and cries aloud
      talk on ye quaint haranguers of the crowd
      declaim in praise of peace when danger calls
      and the fierce foes in arms approach the walls
      he said and turning short with speedy pace
      casts back a scornful glance and quits the place
      thou volusus the volscian troops command
      to mount and lead thyself our ardean band
      messapus and catillus post your force
      along the fields to charge the trojan horse
      some guard the passes others man the wall
      drawn up in arms the rest attend my call

      they swarm from evry quarter of the town
      and with disorderd haste the rampires crown
      good old latinus when he saw too late
      the gathring storm just breaking on the state
      dismissd the council till a fitter time
      and ownd his easy temper as his crime
      who forcd against his reason had complied
      to break the treaty for the promisd bride

      some help to sink new trenches others aid
      to ram the stones or raise the palisade
      hoarse trumpets sound th alarm around the walls
      runs a distracted crew whom their last labour calls
      a sad procession in the streets is seen
      of matrons that attend the mother queen
      high in her chair she sits and at her side
      with downcast eyes appears the fatal bride
      they mount the cliff where pallas temple stands
      prayrs in their mouths and presents in their hands
      with censers first they fume the sacred shrine
      then in this common supplication join
      o patroness of arms unspotted maid
      propitious hear and lend thy latins aid
      break short the pirates lance pronounce his fate
      and lay the phrygian low before the gate

      now turnus arms for fight his back and breast
      welltemperd steel and scaly brass invest
      the cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
      are mingled metal damaskd oer with gold
      his faithful falchion sits upon his side
      nor casque nor crest his manly features hide
      but bare to view amid surrounding friends
      with godlike grace he from the towr descends
      exulting in his strength he seems to dare
      his absent rival and to promise war
      freed from his keepers thus with broken reins
      the wanton courser prances oer the plains
      or in the pride of youth oerleaps the mounds
      and snuffs the females in forbidden grounds
      or seeks his watring in the wellknown flood
      to quench his thirst and cool his fiery blood
      he swims luxuriant in the liquid plain
      and oer his shoulder flows his waving mane
      he neighs he snorts he bears his head on high
      before his ample chest the frothy waters fly

      soon as the prince appears without the gate
      the volscians with their virgin leader wait
      his last commands then with a graceful mien
      lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen
      her squadron imitates and each descends
      whose common suit camilla thus commends
      if sense of honour if a soul secure
      of inborn worth that can all tests endure
      can promise aught or on itself rely
      greatly to dare to conquer or to die
      then i alone sustaind by these will meet
      the tyrrhene troops and promise their defeat
      ours be the danger ours the sole renown
      you genral stay behind and guard the town

      turnus a while stood mute with glad surprise
      and on the fierce virago fixd his eyes
      then thus returnd o grace of italy
      with what becoming thanks can i reply
      not only words lie labring in my breast
      but thought itself is by thy praise oppressd
      yet rob me not of all but let me join
      my toils my hazard and my fame with thine
      the trojan not in stratagem unskilld
      sends his light horse before to scour the field
      himself thro steep ascents and thorny brakes
      a larger compass to the city takes
      this news my scouts confirm and i prepare
      to foil his cunning and his force to dare
      with chosen foot his passage to forelay
      and place an ambush in the winding way
      thou with thy volscians face the tuscan horse
      the brave messapus shall thy troops enforce
      with those of tibur and the latian band
      subjected all to thy supreme command
      this said he warns messapus to the war
      then evry chief exhorts with equal care
      all thus encouragd his own troops he joins
      and hastes to prosecute his deep designs

      inclosd with hills a winding valley lies
      by nature formd for fraud and fitted for surprise
      a narrow track by human steps untrode
      leads thro perplexing thorns to this obscure abode
      high oer the vale a steepy mountain stands
      whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands
      the top is level an offensive seat
      of war and from the war a safe retreat
      for on the right and left is room to press
      the foes at hand or from afar distress
      to drive em headlong downward and to pour
      on their descending backs a stony showr
      thither young turnus took the wellknown way
      possessd the pass and in blind ambush lay

      meantime latonian phoebe from the skies
      beheld th approaching war with hateful eyes
      and calld the lightfoot opis to her aid
      her most belovd and evertrusty maid
      then with a sigh began camilla goes
      to meet her death amidst her fatal foes
      the nymphs i lovd of all my mortal train
      invested with dianas arms in vain
      nor is my kindness for the virgin new
      twas born with her and with her years it grew
      her father metabus when forcd away
      from old privernum for tyrannic sway
      snatchd up and savd from his prevailing foes
      this tender babe companion of his woes
      casmilla was her mother but he drownd
      one hissing letter in a softer sound
      and calld camilla thro the woods he flies
      wrappd in his robe the royal infant lies
      his foes in sight he mends his weary pace
      with shout and clamours they pursue the chase
      the banks of amasene at length he gains

      the raging flood his farther flight restrains
      raisd oer the borders with unusual rains
      prepard to plunge into the stream he fears
      not for himself but for the charge he bears
      anxious he stops a while and thinks in haste
      then desprate in distress resolves at last
      a knotty lance of wellboild oak he bore
      the middle part with cork he coverd oer
      he closd the child within the hollow space
      with twigs of bending osier bound the case
      then poisd the spear heavy with human weight
      and thus invokd my favour for the freight
      accept great goddess of the woods he said
      sent by her sire this dedicated maid
      thro air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine
      and the first weapons that she knows are thine
      he said and with full force the spear he threw
      above the sounding waves camilla flew
      then pressd by foes he stemmd the stormy tide
      and gaind by stress of arms the farther side
      his fastend spear he pulld from out the ground
      and victor of his vows his infant nymph unbound
      nor after that in towns which walls inclose
      would trust his hunted life amidst his foes
      but rough in open air he chose to lie
      earth was his couch his covring was the sky
      on hills unshorn or in a desert den
      he shunnd the dire society of men
      a shepherds solitary life he led
      his daughter with the milk of mares he fed
      the dugs of bears and evry salvage beast
      he drew and thro her lips the liquor pressd
      the little amazon could scarcely go
      he loads her with a quiver and a bow
      and that she might her staggring steps command
      he with a slender javlin fills her hand
      her flowing hair no golden fillet bound
      nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground
      instead of these a tigers hide oerspread
      her back and shoulders fastend to her head
      the flying dart she first attempts to fling
      and round her tender temples tossd the sling
      then as her strength with years increasd began
      to pierce aloft in air the soaring swan
      and from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane
      the tuscan matrons with each other vied
      to bless their rival sons with such a bride
      but she disdains their love to share with me
      the sylvan shades and vowd virginity
      and o i wish contented with my cares
      of salvage spoils she had not sought the wars
      then had she been of my celestial train
      and shunnd the fate that dooms her to be slain
      but since opposing heavns decree she goes
      to find her death among forbidden foes
      haste with these arms and take thy steepy flight
      where with the gods averse the latins fight
      this bow to thee this quiver i bequeath
      this chosen arrow to revenge her death
      by whateer hand camilla shall be slain
      or of the trojan or italian train
      let him not pass unpunishd from the plain
      then in a hollow cloud myself will aid
      to bear the breathless body of my maid
      unspoild shall be her arms and unprofand
      her holy limbs with any human hand
      and in a marble tomb laid in her native land

      she said the faithful nymph descends from high
      with rapid flight and cuts the sounding sky
      black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly

      by this the trojan and the tuscan horse
      drawn up in squadrons with united force
      approach the walls the sprightly coursers bound
      press forward on their bits and shift their ground
      shields arms and spears flash horribly from far
      and the fields glitter with a waving war
      opposd to these come on with furious force
      messapus coras and the latian horse
      these in the body placd on either hand
      sustaind and closd by fair camillas band
      advancing in a line they couch their spears
      and less and less the middle space appears
      thick smoke obscures the field and scarce are seen
      the neighing coursers and the shouting men
      in distance of their darts they stop their course
      then man to man they rush and horse to horse
      the face of heavn their flying javlins hide
      and deaths unseen are dealt on either side
      tyrrhenus and aconteus void of fear
      by mettled coursers borne in full career
      meet first opposd and with a mighty shock
      their horses heads against each other knock
      far from his steed is fierce aconteus cast
      as with an engines force or lightnings blast
      he rolls along in blood and breathes his last
      the latin squadrons take a sudden fright
      and sling their shields behind to save their backs in flight
      spurring at speed to their own walls they drew
      close in the rear the tuscan troops pursue
      and urge their flight asylas leads the chase
      till seizd with shame they wheel about and face
      receive their foes and raise a threatning cry
      the tuscans take their turn to fear and fly
      so swelling surges with a thundring roar
      drivn on each others backs insult the shore
      bound oer the rocks incroach upon the land
      and far upon the beach eject the sand
      then backward with a swing they take their way
      repulsd from upper ground and seek their mother sea
      with equal hurry quit th invaded shore
      and swallow back the sand and stones they spewd before

      twice were the tuscans masters of the field
      twice by the latins in their turn repelld
      ashamd at length to the third charge they ran
      both hosts resolvd and mingled man to man
      now dying groans are heard the fields are strowd
      with falling bodies and are drunk with blood
      arms horses men on heaps together lie
      confusd the fight and more confusd the cry
      orsilochus who durst not press too near
      strong remulus at distance drove his spear
      and stuck the steel beneath his horses ear
      the fiery steed impatient of the wound
      curvets and springing upward with a bound
      his helpless lord cast backward on the ground
      catillus piercd iolas first then drew
      his reeking lance and at herminius threw
      the mighty champion of the tuscan crew
      his neck and throat unarmd his head was bare
      but shaded with a length of yellow hair
      secure he fought exposd on evry part
      a spacious mark for swords and for the flying dart
      across the shoulders came the featherd wound
      transfixd he fell and doubled to the ground
      the sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed
      and death with honour sought on either side

      resistless thro the war camilla rode
      in danger unappalld and pleasd with blood
      one side was bare for her exerted breast
      one shoulder with her painted quiver pressd
      now from afar her fatal javlins play
      now with her axs edge she hews her way
      dianas arms upon her shoulder sound
      and when too closely pressd she quits the ground
      from her bent bow she sends a backward wound
      her maids in martial pomp on either side
      larina tulla fierce tarpeia ride
      italians all in peace their queens delight
      in war the bold companions of the fight
      so marchd the thracian amazons of old
      when thermodon with bloody billows rolld
      such troops as these in shining arms were seen
      when theseus met in fight their maiden queen
      such to the field penthesilea led
      from the fierce virgin when the grecians fled
      with such returnd triumphant from the war
      her maids with cries attend the lofty car
      they clash with manly force their moony shields
      with female shouts resound the phrygian fields

      who foremost and who last heroic maid
      on the cold earth were by thy courage laid
      thy spear of mountain ash eumenius first
      with fury drivn from side to side transpiercd
      a purple stream came spouting from the wound
      bathd in his blood he lies and bites the ground
      liris and pegasus at once she slew
      the former as the slackend reins he drew
      of his faint steed the latter as he stretchd
      his arm to prop his friend the javlin reachd
      by the same weapon sent from the same hand
      both fall together and both spurn the sand
      amastrus next is added to the slain
      the rest in rout she follows oer the plain
      tereus harpalycus demophoon
      and chromis at full speed her fury shun
      of all her deadly darts not one she lost
      each was attended with a trojan ghost
      young ornithus bestrode a hunter steed
      swift for the chase and of apulian breed
      him from afar she spied in arms unknown
      oer his broad back an oxs hide was thrown
      his helm a wolf whose gaping jaws were spread
      a covring for his cheeks and grinnd around his head
      he clenchd within his hand an iron prong
      and towerd above the rest conspicuous in the throng
      him soon she singled from the flying train
      and slew with ease then thus insults the slain
      vain hunter didst thou think thro woods to chase
      the savage herd a vile and trembling race
      here cease thy vaunts and own my victory
      a woman warrior was too strong for thee
      yet if the ghosts demand the conqurors name
      confessing great camilla save thy shame
      then butes and orsilochus she slew
      the bulkiest bodies of the trojan crew
      but butes breast to breast the spear descends
      above the gorget where his helmet ends
      and oer the shield which his left side defends
      orsilochus and she their courses ply
      he seems to follow and she seems to fly
      but in a narrower ring she makes the race
      and then he flies and she pursues the chase
      gathring at length on her deluded foe
      she swings her ax and rises to the blow
      full on the helm behind with such a sway
      the weapon falls the riven steel gives way
      he groans he roars he sues in vain for grace
      brains mingled with his blood besmear his face

      astonishd aunus just arrives by chance
      to see his fall nor farther dares advance
      but fixing on the horrid maid his eye
      he stares and shakes and finds it vain to fly
      yet like a true ligurian born to cheat
      
      cries out aloud what courage have you shown
      who trust your coursers strength and not your own
      forego the vantage of your horse alight
      and then on equal terms begin the fight
      it shall be seen weak woman what you can
      when foot to foot you combat with a man
      he said she glows with anger and disdain
      dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain
      and leaves her horse at large among her train
      with her drawn sword defies him to the field
      and marching lifts aloft her maiden shield
      the youth who thought his cunning did succeed
      reins round his horse and urges all his speed
      adds the remembrance of the spur and hides
      the goring rowels in his bleeding sides
      vain fool and coward cries the lofty maid
      caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid
      on others practice thy ligurian arts
      thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts
      are lost on me nor shalt thou safe retire
      with vaunting lies to thy fallacious sire
      at this so fast her flying feet she sped
      that soon she straind beyond his horses head
      then turning short at once she seizd the rein
      and laid the boaster grovling on the plain
      not with more ease the falcon from above
      trusses in middle air the trembling dove
      then plumes the prey in her strong pounces bound
      the feathers foul with blood come tumbling to the ground

      now mighty jove from his superior height
      with his broad eye surveys th unequal fight
      he fires the breast of tarchon with disdain
      and sends him to redeem th abandond plain
      betwixt the broken ranks the tuscan rides
      and these encourages and those he chides
      recalls each leader by his name from flight
      renews their ardour and restores the fight
      what panic fear has seizd your souls o shame
      o brand perpetual of th etrurian name
      cowards incurable a womans hand
      drives breaks and scatters your ignoble band
      now cast away the sword and quit the shield
      what use of weapons which you dare not wield
      not thus you fly your female foes by night
      nor shun the feast when the full bowls invite
      when to fat offrings the glad augur calls
      and the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals
      these are your studied cares your lewd delight
      swift to debauch but slow to manly fight
      thus having said he spurs amid the foes
      not managing the life he meant to lose
      the first he found he seizd with headlong haste
      in his strong gripe and claspd around the waist
      twas venulus whom from his horse he tore
      and laid athwart his own in triumph bore
      loud shouts ensue the latins turn their eyes
      and view th unusual sight with vast surprise
      the fiery tarchon flying oer the plains
      pressd in his arms the pondrous prey sustains
      then with his shortend spear explores around
      his jointed arms to fix a deadly wound
      nor less the captive struggles for his life
      he writhes his body to prolong the strife
      and fencing for his naked throat exerts
      his utmost vigour and the point averts
      so stoops the yellow eagle from on high
      and bears a speckled serpent thro the sky
      fastning his crooked talons on the prey
      the prisner hisses thro the liquid way
      resists the royal hawk and tho oppressd
      she fights in volumes and erects her crest
      turnd to her foe she stiffens evry scale
      and shoots her forky tongue and whisks her threatning tail
      against the victor all defence is weak
      th imperial bird still plies her with his beak
      he tears her bowels and her breast he gores
      then claps his pinions and securely soars
      thus thro the midst of circling enemies
      strong tarchon snatchd and bore away his prize
      the tyrrhene troops that shrunk before now press
      the latins and presume the like success

      then aruns doomd to death his arts assayd
      to murder unespied the volscian maid
      this way and that his winding course he bends
      and wheresoer she turns her steps attends
      when she retires victorious from the chase
      he wheels about with care and shifts his place
      when rushing on she seeks her foes in fight
      he keeps aloof but keeps her still in sight
      he threats and trembles trying evry way
      unseen to kill and safely to betray
      chloreus the priest of cybele from far
      glittring in phrygian arms amidst the war
      was by the virgin viewd the steed he pressd
      was proud with trappings and his brawny chest
      with scales of gilded brass was coverd oer
      a robe of tyrian dye the rider wore
      with deadly wounds he galld the distant foe
      gnossian his shafts and lycian was his bow
      a golden helm his front and head surrounds
      a gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds
      gold weavd with linen on his thighs he wore
      with flowers of needlework distinguishd oer
      with golden buckles bound and gatherd up before
      him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes
      fond and ambitious of so rich a prize
      or that the temple might his trophies hold
      or else to shine herself in trojan gold
      blind in her haste she chases him alone
      and seeks his life regardless of her own

      this lucky moment the sly traitor chose
      then starting from his ambush up he rose
      and threw but first to heavn addressd his vows
      o patron of socrates high abodes
      phoebus the ruling powr among the gods
      whom first we serve whole woods of unctuous pine
      are felld for thee and to thy glory shine
      by thee protected with our naked soles
      thro flames unsingd we march and tread the kindled coals
      give me propitious powr to wash away
      the stains of this dishonourable day
      nor spoils nor triumph from the fact i claim
      but with my future actions trust my fame
      let me by stealth this female plague oercome
      and from the field return inglorious home
      apollo heard and granting half his prayr
      shuffled in winds the rest and tossd in empty air
      he gives the death desird his safe return
      by southern tempests to the seas is borne

      now when the javlin whizzd along the skies
      both armies on camilla turnd their eyes
      directed by the sound of either host
      th unhappy virgin tho concernd the most
      was only deaf so greedy was she bent
      on golden spoils and on her prey intent
      till in her pap the winged weapon stood
      infixd and deeply drunk the purple blood
      her sad attendants hasten to sustain
      their dying lady drooping on the plain
      far from their sight the trembling aruns flies
      with beating heart and fear confusd with joys
      nor dares he farther to pursue his blow
      or evn to bear the sight of his expiring foe
      as when the wolf has torn a bullocks hide
      at unawares or ranchd a shepherds side
      conscious of his audacious deed he flies
      and claps his quivring tail between his thighs
      so speeding once the wretch no more attends
      but spurring forward herds among his friends

      she wrenchd the javlin with her dying hands
      but wedgd within her breast the weapon stands
      the wood she draws the steely point remains
      she staggers in her seat with agonizing pains
      
      then turns to her whom of her female train
      she trusted most and thus she speaks with pain
      acca tis past he swims before my sight
      inexorable death and claims his right
      bear my last words to turnus fly with speed
      and bid him timely to my charge succeed
      repel the trojans and the town relieve
      farewell and in this kiss my parting breath receive
      she said and sliding sunk upon the plain
      dying her opend hand forsakes the rein
      short and more short she pants by slow degrees
      her mind the passage from her body frees
      she drops her sword she nods her plumy crest
      her drooping head declining on her breast
      in the last sigh her struggling soul expires
      and murmring with disdain to stygian sounds retires

      a shout that struck the golden stars ensued
      despair and rage the languishd fight renewd
      the trojan troops and tuscans in a line
      advance to charge the mixd arcadians join

      but cynthias maid high seated from afar
      surveys the field and fortune of the war
      unmovd a while till prostrate on the plain
      weltring in blood she sees camilla slain
      and round her corpse of friends and foes a fighting train
      then from the bottom of her breast she drew
      a mournful sigh and these sad words ensue
      too dear a fine ah much lamented maid
      for warring with the trojans thou hast paid
      nor aught availd in this unhappy strife
      dianas sacred arms to save thy life
      yet unrevengd thy goddess will not leave
      her votrys death nor with vain sorrow grieve
      branded the wretch and be his name abhorrd
      but after ages shall thy praise record
      th inglorious coward soon shall press the plain
      thus vows thy queen and thus the fates ordain

      high oer the field there stood a hilly mound
      sacred the place and spread with oaks around
      where in a marble tomb dercennus lay
      a king that once in latium bore the sway
      the beauteous opis thither bent her flight
      to mark the traitor aruns from the height
      him in refulgent arms she soon espied
      swoln with success and loudly thus she cried
      thy backward steps vain boaster are too late
      turn like a man at length and meet thy fate
      chargd with my message to camilla go
      and say i sent thee to the shades below
      an honour undeservd from cynthias bow

      she said and from her quiver chose with speed
      the winged shaft predestind for the deed
      then to the stubborn yew her strength applied
      till the far distant horns approachd on either side
      the bowstring touchd her breast so strong she drew
      whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew
      at once the twanging bow and sounding dart
      the traitor heard and felt the point within his heart
      him beating with his heels in pangs of death
      his flying friends to foreign fields bequeath
      the conquring damsel with expanded wings
      the welcome message to her mistress brings

      their leader lost the volscians quit the field
      and unsustaind the chiefs of turnus yield
      the frighted soldiers when their captains fly
      more on their speed than on their strength rely
      confusd in flight they bear each other down
      and spur their horses headlong to the town
      drivn by their foes and to their fears resignd
      not once they turn but take their wounds behind
      these drop the shield and those the lance forego
      or on their shoulders bear the slackend bow
      the hoofs of horses with a rattling sound
      beat short and thick and shake the rotten ground
      black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky
      and oer the darkend walls and rampires fly
      the trembling matrons from their lofty stands
      rend heavn with female shrieks and wring their hands
      all pressing on pursuers and pursued
      are crushd in crowds a mingled multitude
      some happy few escape the throng too late
      rush on for entrance till they choke the gate
      evn in the sight of home the wretched sire
      looks on and sees his helpless son expire
      then in a fright the folding gates they close
      but leave their friends excluded with their foes
      the vanquishd cry the victors loudly shout
      tis terror all within and slaughter all without
      blind in their fear they bounce against the wall
      or to the moats pursued precipitate their fall

      the latian virgins valiant with despair
      armd on the towrs the common danger share
      so much of zeal their countrys cause inspird
      so much camillas great example fird
      poles sharpend in the flames from high they throw
      with imitated darts to gall the foe
      their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath
      and crowd each other to be first in death
      meantime to turnus ambushd in the shade
      with heavy tidings came th unhappy maid
      the volscians overthrown camilla killd
      the foes entirely masters of the field
      like a resistless flood come rolling on
      the cry goes off the plain and thickens to the town

      inflamd with rage 
      he leaves the hilly pass the woods in vain
      possessd and downward issues on the plain
      scarce was he gone when to the straits now freed
      from secret foes the trojan troops succeed
      thro the black forest and the ferny brake
      unknowingly secure their way they take
      from the rough mountains to the plain descend
      and there in order drawn their line extend
      both armies now in open fields are seen
      nor far the distance of the space between
      both to the city bend aeneas sees
      thro smoking fields his hastning enemies
      and turnus views the trojans in array
      and hears th approaching horses proudly neigh
      soon had their hosts in bloody battle joind
      but westward to the sea the sun declind
      intrenchd before the town both armies lie
      while night with sable wings involves the sky




      when turnus saw the latins leave the field
      their armies broken and their courage quelld
      himself become the mark of public spite
      his honour questiond for the promisd fight
      the more he was with vulgar hate oppressd
      the more his fury boild within his breast
      he rousd his vigour for the last debate
      and raisd his haughty soul to meet his fate

      as when the swains the libyan lion chase
      he makes a sour retreat nor mends his pace
      but if the pointed javlin pierce his side
      the lordly beast returns with double pride
      he wrenches out the steel he roars for pain
      his sides he lashes and erects his mane
      so turnus fares his eyeballs flash with fire
      thro his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire

      trembling with rage around the court he ran
      at length approachd the king and thus began
      no more excuses or delays i stand
      in arms prepard to combat hand to hand
      this base deserter of his native land
      the trojan by his word is bound to take
      the same conditions which himself did make
      renew the truce the solemn rites prepare
      and to my single virtue trust the war
      the latians unconcernd shall see the fight
      this arm unaided shall assert your right
      then if my prostrate body press the plain
      to him the crown and beauteous bride remain

      to whom the king sedately thus replied
      brave youth the more your valour has been tried
      the more becomes it us with due respect
      to weigh the chance of war which you neglect
      you want not wealth or a successive throne
      or cities which your arms have made your own
      my towns and treasures are at your command
      and stord with blooming beauties is my land
      laurentum more than one lavinia sees
      unmarried fair of noble families
      now let me speak and you with patience hear
      things which perhaps may grate a lovers ear
      but sound advice proceeding from a heart
      sincerely yours and free from fraudful art
      the gods by signs have manifestly shown
      no prince italian born should heir my throne
      oft have our augurs in prediction skilld
      and oft our priests a foreign son reveald
      yet won by worth that cannot be withstood
      bribd by my kindness to my kindred blood
      urgd by my wife who would not be denied
      i promisd my lavinia for your bride
      her from her plighted lord by force i took
      all ties of treaties and of honour broke
      on your account i wagd an impious war
      with what success tis needless to declare
      i and my subjects feel and you have had your share
      twice vanquishd while in bloody fields we strive
      scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive
      the rolling flood runs warm with human gore
      the bones of latians blanch the neighbring shore
      why put i not an end to this debate
      still unresolvd and still a slave to fate
      if turnus death a lasting peace can give
      why should i not procure it whilst you live
      should i to doubtful arms your youth betray
      what would my kinsmen the rutulians say
      and should you fall in fight 
      how curse the cause which hastend to his end
      the daughters lover and the fathers friend
      weigh in your mind the various chance of war
      pity your parents age and ease his care

      such balmy words he pourd but all in vain
      the profferd medcine but provokd the pain
      the wrathful youth disdaining the relief
      with intermitting sobs thus vents his grief
      the care o best of fathers which you take
      for my concerns at my desire forsake
      permit me not to languish out my days
      but make the best exchange of life for praise
      this arm this lance can well dispute the prize
      and the blood follows where the weapon flies
      his goddess mother is not near to shroud
      the flying coward with an empty cloud

      but now the queen who feard for turnus life
      and loathd the hard conditions of the strife
      held him by force and dying in his death
      in these sad accents gave her sorrow breath
      o turnus i adjure thee by these tears
      and whateer price amatas honour bears
      within thy breast since thou art all my hope
      my sickly minds repose my sinking ages prop
      since on the safety of thy life alone
      depends latinus and the latian throne
      refuse me not this one this only prayr
      to waive the combat and pursue the war
      whatever chance attends this fatal strife
      think it includes in thine amatas life
      i cannot live a slave or see my throne
      usurpd by strangers or a trojan son

      at this a flood of tears lavinia shed
      a crimson blush her beauteous face oerspread
      varying her cheeks by turns with white and red
      the driving colours never at a stay
      run here and there and flush and fade away
      delightful change thus indian ivry shows
      which with the bordring paint of purple glows
      or lilies damaskd by the neighbring rose

      the lover gazd and burning with desire
      the more he lookd the more he fed the fire
      revenge and jealous rage and secret spite
      roll in his breast and rouse him to the fight
      then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes
      firm to his first intent he thus replies
      o mother do not by your tears prepare
      such boding omens and prejudge the war
      resolvd on fight i am no longer free
      to shun my death if heavn my death decree
      then turning to the herald thus pursues
      go greet the trojan with ungrateful news
      denounce from me that when tomorrows light
      shall gild the heavns he need not urge the fight
      the trojan and rutulian troops no more
      shall dye with mutual blood the latian shore
      our single swords the quarrel shall decide
      and to the victor be the beauteous bride

      he said and striding on with speedy pace
      he sought his coursers of the thracian race
      at his approach they toss their heads on high
      and proudly neighing promise victory
      the sires of these orythia sent from far
      to grace pilumnus when he went to war
      the drifts of thracian snows were scarce so white
      nor northern winds in fleetness matchd their flight
      officious grooms stand ready by his side
      and some with combs their flowing manes divide
      and others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride

      he sheathd his limbs in arms a temperd mass
      of golden metal those and mountain brass
      then to his head his glittring helm he tied
      and girt his faithful falchion to his side
      in his aetnaean forge the god of fire
      that falchion labourd for the heros sire
      immortal keenness on the blade bestowd
      and plungd it hissing in the stygian flood
      proppd on a pillar which the ceiling bore
      was placd the lance auruncan actor wore
      which with such force he brandishd in his hand
      the tough ash trembled like an osier wand
      then cried o pondrous spoil of actor slain
      and never yet by turnus tossd in vain
      fail not this day thy wonted force but go
      sent by this hand to pierce the trojan foe
      give me to tear his corslet from his breast
      and from that eunuch head to rend the crest
      draggd in the dust his frizzled hair to soil
      hot from the vexing irn and smeard with fragrant oil

      thus while he raves from his wide nostrils flies
      a fiery steam and sparkles from his eyes
      so fares the bull in his lovd females sight
      proudly he bellows and preludes the fight
      he tries his goring horns against a tree
      and meditates his absent enemy
      he pushes at the winds he digs the strand
      with his black hoofs and spurns the yellow sand

      nor less the trojan in his lemnian arms
      to future fight his manly courage warms
      he whets his fury and with joy prepares
      to terminate at once the lingring wars
      to cheer his chiefs and tender son relates
      what heavn had promisd and expounds the fates
      then to the latian king he sends to cease
      the rage of arms and ratify the peace

      the morn ensuing from the mountains height
      had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light
      th ethereal coursers bounding from the sea
      from out their flaming nostrils breathd the day
      when now the trojan and rutulian guard
      in friendly labour joind the list prepard
      beneath the walls they measure out the space
      then sacred altars rear on sods of grass
      where with religious rites their common gods they place
      in purest white the priests their heads attire
      and living waters bear and holy fire
      and oer their linen hoods and shaded hair
      long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear

      in order issuing from the town appears
      the latin legion armd with pointed spears
      and from the fields advancing on a line
      the trojan and the tuscan forces join
      their various arms afford a pleasing sight
      a peaceful train they seem in peace prepard for fight
      betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride
      glittring with gold and vests in purple dyed
      here mnestheus author of the memmian line
      and there messapus born of seed divine
      the sign is givn and round the listed space
      each man in order fills his proper place
      reclining on their ample shields they stand
      and fix their pointed lances in the sand
      now studious of the sight a numrous throng
      of either sex promiscuous old and young
      swarm the town by those who rest behind
      the gates and walls and houses tops are lind
      meantime the queen of heavn beheld the sight
      with eyes unpleasd from mount albanos height
      
      she thence surveyd the field the trojan powrs
      the latian squadrons and laurentine towrs
      then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke
      with sighs and tears the goddess of the lake
      king turnus sister once a lovely maid
      ere to the lust of lawless jove betrayd
      compressd by force but by the grateful god
      now made the nais of the neighbring flood
      o nymph the pride of living lakes said she
      o most renownd and most belovd by me
      long hast thou known nor need i to record
      the wanton sallies of my wandring lord
      of evry latian fair whom jove misled
      to mount by stealth my violated bed
      to thee alone i grudgd not his embrace
      but gave a part of heavn and an unenvied place
      now learn from me thy near approaching grief
      nor think my wishes want to thy relief
      while fortune favourd nor heavns king denied
      to lend my succour to the latian side
      i savd thy brother and the sinking state
      but now he struggles with unequal fate
      and goes with gods averse oermatchd in might
      to meet inevitable death in fight
      nor must i break the truce nor can sustain the sight
      thou if thou darst thy present aid supply
      it well becomes a sisters care to try

      at this the lovely nymph with grief oppressd
      thrice tore her hair and beat her comely breast
      to whom saturnia thus thy tears are late
      haste snatch him if he can be snatchd from fate
      new tumults kindle violate the truce
      who knows what changeful fortune may produce
      tis not a crime t attempt what i decree
      or if it were discharge the crime on me
      she said and sailing on the winged wind
      left the sad nymph suspended in her mind

      and now in pomp the peaceful kings appear
      four steeds the chariot of latinus bear
      twelve golden beams around his temples play
      to mark his lineage from the god of day
      two snowy coursers turnus chariot yoke
      and in his hand two massy spears he shook
      then issued from the camp in arms divine
      aeneas author of the roman line
      and by his side ascanius took his place
      the second hope of romes immortal race
      adornd in white a revrend priest appears
      and offrings to the flaming altars bears
      a porket and a lamb that never sufferd shears
      then to the rising sun he turns his eyes
      and strews the beasts designd for sacrifice
      with salt and meal with like officious care
      he marks their foreheads and he clips their hair
      betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds
      with the same genrous juice the flame he feeds

      aeneas then unsheathd his shining sword
      and thus with pious prayrs the gods adord
      allseeing sun and thou ausonian soil
      for which i have sustaind so long a toil
      thou king of heavn and thou the queen of air
      propitious now and reconcild by prayr
      thou god of war whose unresisted sway
      the labours and events of arms obey
      ye living fountains and ye running floods
      all powrs of ocean all ethereal gods
      hear and bear record if i fall in field
      or recreant in the fight to turnus yield
      my trojans shall encrease evanders town
      ascanius shall renounce th ausonian crown
      all claims all questions of debate shall cease
      nor he nor they with force infringe the peace
      but if my juster arms prevail in fight
      
      my trojans shall not oer th italians reign
      both equal both unconquerd shall remain
      joind in their laws their lands and their abodes
      i ask but altars for my weary gods
      the care of those religious rites be mine
      the crown to king latinus i resign
      his be the sovreign sway nor will i share
      his powr in peace or his command in war
      for me my friends another town shall frame
      and bless the rising towrs with fair lavinias name

      thus he then with erected eyes and hands
      the latian king before his altar stands
      by the same heavn said he and earth and main
      and all the powrs that all the three contain
      by hell below and by that upper god
      whose thunder signs the peace who seals it with his nod
      so let latonas double offspring hear
      and doublefronted janus what i swear
      i touch the sacred altars touch the flames
      and all those powrs attest and all their names
      whatever chance befall on either side
      no term of time this union shall divide
      no force no fortune shall my vows unbind
      or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind
      not tho the circling seas should break their bound
      oerflow the shores or sap the solid ground
      not tho the lamps of heavn their spheres forsake
      hurld down and hissing in the nether lake
      evn as this royal scepter  shall never more
      shoot out in branches or renew the birth
      an orphan now cut from the mother earth
      by the keen ax dishonourd of its hair
      and casd in brass for latian kings to bear

      when thus in public view the peace was tied
      with solemn vows and sworn on either side
      all dues performd which holy rites require
      the victim beasts are slain before the fire
      the trembling entrails from their bodies torn
      and to the fattend flames in chargers borne

      already the rutulians deem their man
      oermatchd in arms before the fight began
      first rising fears are whisperd thro the crowd
      then gathring sound they murmur more aloud
      now side to side they measure with their eyes
      the champions bulk their sinews and their size
      the nearer they approach the more is known
      th apparent disadvantage of their own
      turnus himself appears in public sight
      conscious of fate desponding of the fight
      slowly he moves and at his altar stands
      with eyes dejected and with trembling hands
      and while he mutters undistinguishd prayrs
      a livid deadness in his cheeks appears

      with anxious pleasure when juturna viewd
      th increasing fright of the mad multitude
      when their short sighs and thickning sobs she heard
      and found their ready minds for change prepard
      dissembling her immortal form she took
      camertus mien his habit and his look
      a chief of ancient blood in arms well known
      was his great sire and he his greater son
      his shape assumd amid the ranks she ran
      and humoring their first motions thus began
      for shame rutulians can you bear the sight
      of one exposd for all in single fight
      can we before the face of heavn confess
      our courage colder or our numbers less
      view all the trojan host th arcadian band
      and tuscan army count em as they stand
      undaunted to the battle if we go
      scarce evry second man will share a foe
      turnus tis true in this unequal strife
      shall lose with honour his devoted life
      or change it rather for immortal fame
      succeeding to the gods from whence he came
      but you a servile and inglorious band
      for foreign lords shall sow your native land
      those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gaind
      which have so long their lazy sons sustaind
      with words like these she carried her design
      a rising murmur runs along the line
      then evn the city troops and latians tird
      with tedious war seem with new souls inspird
      their champions fate with pity they lament
      and of the league so lately sworn repent

      nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
      with lying wonders and a false presage
      but adds a sign which present to their eyes
      inspires new courage and a glad surprise
      for sudden in the fiery tracts above
      appears in pomp th imperial bird of jove
      a plump of fowl he spies that swim the lakes
      and oer their heads his sounding pinions shakes
      then stooping on the fairest of the train
      in his strong talons trussd a silver swan
      th italians wonder at th unusual sight
      but while he lags and labours in his flight
      behold the dastard fowl return anew
      and with united force the foe pursue
      clamrous around the royal hawk they fly
      and thickning in a cloud oershade the sky
      they cuff they scratch they cross his airy course
      nor can th incumberd bird sustain their force
      but vexd not vanquishd drops the pondrous prey
      and lightend of his burthen wings his way

      th ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight
      eager of action and demand the fight
      then king tolumnius versd in augurs arts
      cries out and thus his boasted skill imparts
      at length tis granted what i long desird
      this this is what my frequent vows requird
      ye gods i take your omen and obey
      advance my friends and charge i lead the way
      these are the foreign foes whose impious band
      like that rapacious bird infest our land
      but soon like him they shall be forcd to sea
      by strength united and forego the prey
      your timely succour to your country bring
      haste to the rescue and redeem your king

      he said and pressing onward thro the crew
      poisd in his lifted arm his lance he threw
      the winged weapon whistling in the wind
      came driving on nor missd the mark designd
      at once the cornel rattled in the skies
      at once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise
      nine brothers in a goodly band there stood
      born of arcadian mixd with tuscan blood
      gylippus sons the fatal javlin flew
      aimd at the midmost of the friendly crew
      a passage thro the jointed arms it found
      just where the belt was to the body bound
      and struck the gentle youth extended on the ground
      then fird with pious rage the genrous train
      run madly forward to revenge the slain
      and some with eager haste their javlins throw
      and some with sword in hand assault the foe

      the wishd insult the latine troops embrace
      and meet their ardour in the middle space
      the trojans tuscans and arcadian line
      with equal courage obviate their design
      peace leaves the violated fields and hate
      both armies urges to their mutual fate
      with impious haste their altars are oerturnd
      the sacrifice halfbroild and halfunburnd
      thick storms of steel from either army fly
      and clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky
      brands from the fire are missive weapons made
      with chargers bowls and all the priestly trade
      latinus frighted hastens from the fray
      and bears his unregarded gods away
      these on their horses vault those yoke the car
      the rest with swords on high run headlong to the war

      messapus eager to confound the peace
      spurrd his hot courser thro the fighting press
      at king aulestes by his purple known
      a tuscan prince and by his regal crown
      and with a shock encountring bore him down
      backward he fell and as his fate designd
      the ruins of an altar were behind
      there pitching on his shoulders and his head
      amid the scattring fires he lay supinely spread
      the beamy spear descending from above
      his cuirass piercd and thro his body drove
      then with a scornful smile the victor cries
      the gods have found a fitter sacrifice
      greedy of spoils th italians strip the dead
      of his rich armour and uncrown his head

      priest corynaeus armd his better hand
      from his own altar with a blazing brand
      and as ebusus with a thundring pace
      advancd to battle dashd it on his face
      his bristly beard shines out with sudden fires
      the crackling crop a noisome scent expires
      following the blow he seizd his curling crown
      with his left hand his other cast him down
      the prostrate body with his knees he pressd
      and plungd his holy poniard in his breast

      while podalirius with his sword pursued
      the shepherd alsus thro the flying crowd
      swiftly he turns and aims a deadly blow
      full on the front of his unwary foe
      the broad ax enters with a crashing sound
      and cleaves the chin with one continued wound
      warm blood and mingled brains besmear his arms around
      an iron sleep his stupid eyes oppressd
      and seald their heavy lids in endless rest

      but good aeneas rushd amid the bands
      bare was his head and naked were his hands
      in sign of truce then thus he cries aloud
      what sudden rage what new desire of blood
      inflames your alterd minds o trojans cease
      from impious arms nor violate the peace
      by human sanctions and by laws divine
      the terms are all agreed the war is mine
      dismiss your fears and let the fight ensue
      this hand alone shall right the gods and you
      our injurd altars and their broken vow
      to this avenging sword the faithless turnus owe

      thus while he spoke unmindful of defence
      a winged arrow struck the pious prince
      but whether from some human hand it came
      or hostile god is left unknown by fame
      no human hand or hostile god was found
      to boast the triumph of so base a wound

      when turnus saw the trojan quit the plain
      his chiefs dismayd his troops a fainting train
      th unhopd event his heightend soul inspires
      at once his arms and coursers he requires
      then with a leap his lofty chariot gains
      and with a ready hand assumes the reins
      he drives impetuous and whereer he goes
      he leaves behind a lane of slaughterd foes
      these his lance reaches over those he rolls
      his rapid car and crushes out their souls
      in vain the vanquishd fly the victor sends
      the dead mens weapons at their living friends
      thus on the banks of hebrus freezing flood
      the god of battles in his angry mood
      clashing his sword against his brazen shield
      let loose the reins and scours along the field
      before the wind his fiery coursers fly
      groans the sad earth resounds the rattling sky
      wrath terror treason tumult and despair
       surround the car
      friends of the god and followers of the war
      with fury not unlike nor less disdain
      exulting turnus flies along the plain
      his smoking horses at their utmost speed
      he lashes on and urges oer the dead
      their fetlocks run with blood and when they bound
      the gore and gathring dust are dashd around
      thamyris and pholus masters of the war
      he killd at hand but sthenelus afar
      from far the sons of imbracus he slew
      glaucus and lades of the lycian crew
      both taught to fight on foot in battle joind
      or mount the courser that outstrips the wind

      meantime eumedes vaunting in the field
      new fird the trojans and their foes repelld
      this son of dolon bore his grandsires name
      but emulated more his fathers fame
      his guileful father sent a nightly spy
      the grecian camp and order to descry
      hard enterprise and well he might require
      achilles car and horses for his hire
      but met upon the scout th aetolian prince
      in death bestowd a juster recompense
      fierce turnus viewd the trojan from afar
      and launchd his javlin from his lofty car
      then lightly leaping down pursued the blow
      and pressing with his foot his prostrate foe
      wrenchd from his feeble hold the shining sword
      and plungd it in the bosom of its lord
      possess said he the fruit of all thy pains
      and measure at thy length our latian plains
      thus are my foes rewarded by my hand
      thus may they build their town and thus enjoy the land

      then dares butes sybaris he slew
      whom oer his neck his floundring courser threw
      as when loud boreas with his blustring train
      stoops from above incumbent on the main
      whereer he flies he drives the rack before
      and rolls the billows on th aegaean shore
      so where resistless turnus takes his course
      the scatterd squadrons bend before his force
      his crest of horses hair is blown behind
      by adverse air and rustles in the wind

      this haughty phegeus saw with high disdain
      and as the chariot rolld along the plain
      light from the ground he leapt and seizd the rein
      thus hung in air he still retaind his hold
      the coursers frighted and their course controlld
      the lance of turnus reachd him as he hung
      and piercd his plated arms but passd along
      and only razd the skin he turnd and held
      against his threatning foe his ample shield
      then calld for aid but while he cried in vain
      the chariot bore him backward on the plain
      he lies reversd the victor king descends
      and strikes so justly where his helmet ends
      he lops the head the latian fields are drunk
      with streams that issue from the bleeding trunk

      while he triumphs and while the trojans yield
      the wounded prince is forcd to leave the field
      strong mnestheus and achates often tried
      and young ascanius weeping by his side
      conduct him to his tent scarce can he rear
      his limbs from earth supported on his spear
      resolvd in mind regardless of the smart
      he tugs with both his hands and breaks the dart
      the steel remains no readier way he found
      to draw the weapon than t inlarge the wound
      eager of fight impatient of delay
      he begs and his unwilling friends obey

      iapis was at hand to prove his art
      whose blooming youth so fird apollos heart
      that for his love he profferd to bestow
      his tuneful harp and his unerring bow
      the pious youth more studious how to save
      his aged sire now sinking to the grave
      preferrd the powr of plants and silent praise
      of healing arts before phoebean bays

      proppd on his lance the pensive hero stood
      and heard and saw unmovd the mourning crowd
      the famd physician tucks his robes around
      with ready hands and hastens to the wound
      with gentle touches he performs his part
      this way and that soliciting the dart
      and exercises all his heavnly art
      all softning simples known of sovreign use
      he presses out and pours their noble juice
      these first infusd to lenify the pain
      he tugs with pincers but he tugs in vain
      then to the patron of his art he prayd
      the patron of his art refusd his aid

      meantime the war approaches to the tents
      th alarm grows hotter and the noise augments
      the driving dust proclaims the danger near
      and first their friends and then their foes appear
      their friends retreat their foes pursue the rear
      the camp is filld with terror and affright
      the hissing shafts within the trench alight
      an undistinguishd noise ascends the sky
      the shouts of those who kill and groans of those who die

      but now the goddess mother movd with grief
      and piercd with pity hastens her relief
      a branch of healing dittany she brought
      which in the cretan fields with care she sought
      rough is the stem which woolly leafs surround
      the leafs with flowrs the flowrs with purple crownd
      well known to wounded goats a sure relief
      to draw the pointed steel and ease the grief
      this venus brings in clouds involvd and brews
      th extracted liquor with ambrosian dews
      and odorous panacee unseen she stands
      tempring the mixture with her heavnly hands
      and pours it in a bowl already crownd
      with juice of medcnal herbs prepard to bathe the wound
      the leech unknowing of superior art
      which aids the cure with this foments the part
      and in a moment ceasd the raging smart
      stanchd is the blood and in the bottom stands
      the steel but scarcely touchd with tender hands
      moves up and follows of its own accord
      and health and vigour are at once restord
      iapis first perceivd the closing wound
      and first the footsteps of a god he found
      arms arms he cries the sword and shield prepare
      and send the willing chief renewd to war
      this is no mortal work no cure of mine
      nor arts effect but done by hands divine
      some god our general to the battle sends
      some god preserves his life for greater ends

      the hero arms in haste his hands infold
      his thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold
      inflamd to fight and rushing to the field
      that hand sustaining the celestial shield
      this gripes the lance and with such vigour shakes
      that to the rest the beamy weapon quakes
      then with a close embrace he straind his son
      and kissing thro his helmet thus begun
      my son from my example learn the war
      in camps to suffer and in fields to dare
      but happier chance than mine attend thy care
      this day my hand thy tender age shall shield
      and crown with honours of the conquerd field
      thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth
      to toils of war be mindful of my worth
      assert thy birthright and in arms be known
      for hectors nephew and aeneas son
      he said and striding issued on the plain
      anteus and mnestheus and a numrous train
      attend his steps the rest their weapons take
      and crowding to the field the camp forsake
      a cloud of blinding dust is raisd around
      labours beneath their feet the trembling ground

      now turnus posted on a hill from far
      beheld the progress of the moving war
      with him the latins viewd the coverd plains
      and the chill blood ran backward in their veins
      juturna saw th advancing troops appear
      and heard the hostile sound and fled for fear
      aeneas leads and draws a sweeping train
      closd in their ranks and pouring on the plain
      as when a whirlwind rushing to the shore
      from the mid ocean drives the waves before
      the painful hind with heavy heart foresees
      the flatted fields and slaughter of the trees
      with like impetuous rage the prince appears
      before his doubled front nor less destruction bears
      and now both armies shock in open field
      osiris is by strong thymbraeus killd
      archetius ufens epulon are slain
      
      by gyas mnestheus and achates hand
      the fatal augur falls by whose command
      the truce was broken and whose lance embrued
      with trojan blood th unhappy fight renewd
      loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky
      and oer the field the frighted latins fly
      the prince disdains the dastards to pursue
      nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few
      turnus alone amid the dusky plain
      he seeks and to the combat calls in vain
      juturna heard and seizd with mortal fear
      forcd from the beam her brothers charioteer
      assumes his shape his armour and his mien
      and like metiscus in his seat is seen

      as the black swallow near the palace plies
      oer empty courts and under arches flies
      now hawks aloft now skims along the flood
      to furnish her loquacious nest with food
      so drives the rapid goddess oer the plains
      the smoking horses run with loosend reins
      she steers a various course among the foes
      now here now there her conquring brother shows
      now with a straight now with a wheeling flight
      she turns and bends but shuns the single fight
      aeneas fird with fury breaks the crowd
      and seeks his foe and calls by name aloud
      he runs within a narrower ring and tries
      to stop the chariot but the chariot flies
      if he but gain a glimpse juturna fears
      and far away the daunian hero bears

      what should he do nor arts nor arms avail
      and various cares in vain his mind assail
      the great messapus thundring thro the field
      in his left hand two pointed javlins held
      encountring on the prince one dart he drew
      and with unerring aim and utmost vigour threw
      aeneas saw it come and stooping low
      beneath his buckler shunnd the threatning blow
      the weapon hissd above his head and tore
      the waving plume which on his helm he wore
      forced by this hostile act and fird with spite
      that flying turnus still declind the fight
      the prince whose piety had long repelld
      his inborn ardour now invades the field
      invokes the powrs of violated peace
      their rites and injurd altars to redress
      then to his rage abandoning the rein
      with blood and slaughterd bodies fills the plain

      what god can tell what numbers can display
      the various labours of that fatal day
      what chiefs and champions fell on either side
      in combat slain or by what deaths they died
      whom turnus whom the trojan hero killd
      who shard the fame and fortune of the field
      jove couldst thou view and not avert thy sight
      two jarring nations joind in cruel fight
      whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite

      aeneas first rutulian sucro found
      whose valour made the trojans quit their ground
      betwixt his ribs the javlin drove so just
      it reachd his heart nor needs a second thrust
      now turnus at two blows two brethren slew
      first from his horse fierce amycus he threw
      then leaping on the ground on foot assaild
      diores and in equal fight prevaild
      their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place
      their heads distilling gore his chariot grace

      three cold on earth the trojan hero threw
      whom without respite at one charge he slew
      cethegus tanais tagus fell oppressd
      and sad onythes added to the rest
      of theban blood whom peridia bore

      turnus two brothers from the lycian shore
      and from apollos fane to battle sent
      oerthrew nor phoebus could their fate prevent
      peaceful menoetes after these he killd
      who long had shunnd the dangers of the field
      on lernas lake a silent life he led
      and with his nets and angle earnd his bread
      nor pompous cares nor palaces he knew
      but wisely from th infectious world withdrew
      poor was his house his fathers painful hand
      dischargd his rent and plowd anothers land

      as flames among the lofty woods are thrown
      on diffrent sides and both by winds are blown
      the laurels crackle in the sputtring fire
      the frighted sylvans from their shades retire
      or as two neighbring torrents fall from high
      rapid they run the foamy waters fry
      they roll to sea with unresisted force
      and down the rocks precipitate their course
      not with less rage the rival heroes take
      their diffrent ways nor less destruction make
      with spears afar with swords at hand they strike
      and zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike
      like them their dauntless men maintain the field
      and hearts are piercd unknowing how to yield
      they blow for blow return and wound for wound
      and heaps of bodies raise the level ground

      murranus boasting of his blood that springs
      from a long royal race of latian kings
      is by the trojan from his chariot thrown
      crushd with the weight of an unwieldy stone
      betwixt the wheels he fell the wheels that bore
      his living load his dying body tore
      his starting steeds to shun the glittring sword
      paw down his trampled limbs forgetful of their lord

      fierce hyllus threatend high and face to face
      affronted turnus in the middle space
      the prince encounterd him in full career
      and at his temples aimd the deadly spear
      so fatally the flying weapon sped
      that thro his brazen helm it piercd his head
      nor cisseus couldst thou scape from turnus hand
      in vain the strongest of th arcadian band
      nor to cupentus could his gods afford
      availing aid against th aenean sword
      which to his naked heart pursued the course
      nor could his plated shield sustain the force

      iolas fell whom not the grecian powrs
      nor great subverter of the trojan towrs
      were doomd to kill while heavn prolongd his date
      but who can pass the bounds prefixd by fate
      in high lyrnessus and in troy he held
      two palaces and was from each expelld
      of all the mighty man the last remains
      a little spot of foreign earth contains

      and now both hosts their broken troops unite
      in equal ranks and mix in mortal fight
      seresthus and undaunted mnestheus join
      the trojan tuscan and arcadian line
      seaborn messapus with atinas heads
      the latin squadrons and to battle leads
      they strike they push they throng the scanty space
      resolvd on death impatient of disgrace
      and where one falls another fills his place

      the cyprian goddess now inspires her son
      to leave th unfinishd fight and storm the town
      for while he rolls his eyes around the plain
      in quest of turnus whom he seeks in vain
      he views th unguarded city from afar
      in careless quiet and secure of war
      occasion offers and excites his mind
      to dare beyond the task he first designd
      resolvd he calls his chiefs they leave the fight
      attended thus he takes a neighbring height
      the crowding troops about their genral stand
      all under arms and wait his high command
      then thus the lofty prince hear and obey
      ye trojan bands without the least delay
      jove is with us and what i have decreed
      requires our utmost vigour and our speed
      your instant arms against the town prepare
      the source of mischief and the seat of war
      this day the latian towrs that mate the sky
      shall level with the plain in ashes lie
      the people shall be slaves unless in time
      they kneel for pardon and repent their crime
      twice have our foes been vanquishd on the plain
      then shall i wait till turnus will be slain
      your force against the perjurd city bend
      there it began and there the war shall end
      the peace profand our rightful arms requires
      cleanse the polluted place with purging fires

      he finishd and one soul inspiring all
      formd in a wedge the foot approach the wall
      without the town an unprovided train
      of gaping gazing citizens are slain
      some firebrands others scaling ladders bear
      and those they toss aloft and these they rear
      the flames now launchd the featherd arrows fly
      and clouds of missive arms obscure the sky
      advancing to the front the hero stands
      and stretching out to heavn his pious hands
      attests the gods asserts his innocence
      upbraids with breach of faith th ausonian prince
      declares the royal honour doubly staind
      and twice the rites of holy peace profand

      dissenting clamours in the town arise
      each will be heard and all at once advise
      one part for peace and one for war contends
      some would exclude their foes and some admit their friends
      the helpless king is hurried in the throng
      and whateer tide prevails is borne along
      thus when the swain within a hollow rock
      invades the bees with suffocating smoke
      they run around or labour on their wings
      disusd to flight and shoot their sleepy stings
      to shun the bitter fumes in vain they try
      black vapours issuing from the vent involve the sky

      but fate and envious fortune now prepare
      to plunge the latins in the last despair
      the queen who saw the foes invade the town
      and brands on tops of burning houses thrown
      cast round her eyes distracted with her fear
      no troops of turnus in the field appear
      once more she stares abroad but still in vain
      and then concludes the royal youth is slain
      mad with her anguish impotent to bear
      the mighty grief she loathes the vital air
      she calls herself the cause of all this ill
      and owns the dire effects of her ungovernd will
      she raves against the gods she beats her breast
      she tears with both her hands her purple vest
      then round a beam a running noose she tied
      and fastend by the neck obscenely died

      soon as the fatal news by fame was blown
      and to her dames and to her daughter known
      the sad lavinia rends her yellow hair
      and rosy cheeks the rest her sorrow share
      with shrieks the palace rings and madness of despair
      the spreading rumour fills the public place
      confusion fear distraction and disgrace
      and silent shame are seen in evry face
      latinus tears his garments as he goes
      both for his public and his private woes
      with filth his venerable beard besmears
      and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs
      and much he blames the softness of his mind
      obnoxious to the charms of womankind
      and soon seducd to change what he so well designd
      to break the solemn league so long desird
      nor finish what his fates and those of troy requird

      now turnus rolls aloof oer empty plains
      and here and there some straggling foes he gleans
      his flying coursers please him less and less
      ashamd of easy fight and cheap success
      thus halfcontented anxious in his mind
      the distant cries come driving in the wind
      shouts from the walls but shouts in murmurs drownd
      a jarring mixture and a boding sound
      alas said he what mean these dismal cries
      what doleful clamours from the town arise
      confusd he stops and backward pulls the reins
      she who the drivers office now sustains
      replies neglect my lord these new alarms
      here fight and urge the fortune of your arms
      there want not others to defend the wall
      if by your rivals hand th italians fall
      so shall your fatal sword his friends oppress
      in honour equal equal in success

      to this the prince o sisterfor i knew
      the peace infringd proceeded first from you
      i knew you when you mingled first in fight
      and now in vain you would deceive my sight
      why goddess this unprofitable care
      who sent you down from heavn involvd in air
      your share of mortal sorrows to sustain
      and see your brother bleeding on the plain
      for to what powr can turnus have recourse
      or how resist his fates prevailing force
      these eyes beheld murranus bite the ground
      mighty the man and mighty was the wound
      i heard my dearest friend with dying breath
      my name invoking to revenge his death
      brave ufens fell with honour on the place
      to shun the shameful sight of my disgrace
      on earth supine a manly corpse he lies
      his vest and armour are the victors prize
      then shall i see laurentum in a flame
      which only wanted to complete my shame
      how will the latins hoot their champions flight
      how drances will insult and point them to the sight
      is death so hard to bear ye gods below
      
      receive a soul unsullied yet with shame
      which not belies my great forefathers name

      he said and while he spoke with flying speed
      came sages urging on his foamy steed
      fixd on his wounded face a shaft he bore
      and seeking turnus sent his voice before
      turnus on you on you alone depends
      our last relief compassionate your friends
      like lightning fierce aeneas rolling on
      with arms invests with flames invades the town
      the brands are tossd on high the winds conspire
      to drive along the deluge of the fire
      all eyes are fixd on you your foes rejoice
      evn the king staggers and suspends his choice
      doubts to deliver or defend the town
      whom to reject or whom to call his son
      the queen on whom your utmost hopes were placd
      herself suborning death has breathd her last
      tis true messapus fearless of his fate
      with fierce atinas aid defends the gate
      on evry side surrounded by the foe
      the more they kill the greater numbers grow
      an iron harvest mounts and still remains to mow
      you far aloof from your forsaken bands
      your rolling chariot drive oer empty sands

      stupid he sate his eyes on earth declind
      and various cares revolving in his mind
      rage boiling from the bottom of his breast
      and sorrow mixd with shame his soul oppressd
      and conscious worth lay labring in his thought
      and love by jealousy to madness wrought
      by slow degrees his reason drove away
      the mists of passion and resumd her sway
      then rising on his car he turnd his look
      and saw the town involvd in fire and smoke
      a wooden towr with flames already blazd
      which his own hands on beams and rafters raisd
      and bridges laid above to join the space
      and wheels below to roll from place to place
      sister the fates have vanquishd let us go
      the way which heavn and my hard fortune show
      the fight is fixd nor shall the branded name
      of a base coward blot your brothers fame
      death is my choice but suffer me to try
      my force and vent my rage before i die
      he said and leaping down without delay
      thro crowds of scatterd foes he freed his way
      striding he passd impetuous as the wind
      and left the grieving goddess far behind
      as when a fragment from a mountain torn
      by raging tempests or by torrents borne
      or sappd by time or loosend from the roots
      prone thro the void the rocky ruin shoots
      rolling from crag to crag from steep to steep
      down sink at once the shepherds and their sheep
      involvd alike they rush to nether ground
      stunnd with the shock they fall and stunnd from earth rebound
      so turnus hasting headlong to the town
      shouldring and shoving bore the squadrons down
      still pressing onward to the walls he drew
      where shafts and spears and darts promiscuous flew
      and sanguine streams the slippry ground embrue
      first stretching out his arm in sign of peace
      he cries aloud to make the combat cease
      rutulians hold and latin troops retire
      the fight is mine and me the gods require
      tis just that i should vindicate alone
      the broken truce or for the breach atone
      this day shall free from wars th ausonian state
      or finish my misfortunes in my fate

      both armies from their bloody work desist
      and bearing backward form a spacious list
      the trojan hero who receivd from fame
      the welcome sound and heard the champions name
      soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls
      greedy of war where greater glory calls
      he springs to fight exulting in his force
      his jointed armour rattles in the course
      like eryx or like athos great he shows
      or father apennine when white with snows
      his head divine obscure in clouds he hides
      and shakes the sounding forest on his sides
      the nations overawd surcease the fight
      immovable their bodies fixd their sight
      evn death stands still nor from above they throw
      their darts nor drive their battringrams below
      in silent order either army stands
      and drop their swords unknowing from their hands
      th ausonian king beholds with wondring sight
      two mighty champions matchd in single fight
      born under climes remote and brought by fate
      with swords to try their titles to the state

      now in closd field each other from afar
      they view and rushing on begin the war
      they launch their spears then hand to hand they meet
      the trembling soil resounds beneath their feet
      their bucklers clash thick blows descend from high
      and flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly
      courage conspires with chance and both engage
      with equal fortune yet and mutual rage
      as when two bulls for their fair female fight
      in silas shades or on taburnus height
      with horns adverse they meet the keeper flies
      mute stands the herd the heifers roll their eyes
      and wait th event which victor they shall bear
      and who shall be the lord to rule the lusty year
      with rage of love the jealous rivals burn
      and push for push and wound for wound return
      their dewlaps gord their sides are lavd in blood
      loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro the wood
      such was the combat in the listed ground
      so clash their swords and so their shields resound

      jove sets the beam in either scale he lays
      the champions fate and each exactly weighs
      on this side life and lucky chance ascends
      loaded with death that other scale descends
      raisd on the stretch young turnus aims a blow
      full on the helm of his unguarded foe
      shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side
      as hopes and fears their panting hearts divide
      but all in pieces flies the traitor sword
      and in the middle stroke deserts his lord
      now is but death or flight disarmd he flies
      when in his hand an unknown hilt he spies
      fame says that turnus when his steeds he joind
      hurrying to war disorderd in his mind
      snatchd the first weapon which his haste could find
      twas not the fated sword his father bore
      but that his charioteer metiscus wore
      this while the trojans fled the toughness held
      but vain against the great vulcanian shield
      the mortaltemperd steel deceivd his hand
      the shiverd fragments shone amid the sand

      surprisd with fear he fled along the field
      and now forthright and now in orbits wheeld
      for here the trojan troops the list surround
      and there the pass is closd with pools and marshy ground
      aeneas hastens tho with heavier pace
      his wound so newly knit retards the chase
      and oft his trembling knees their aid refuse
      yet pressing foot by foot his foe pursues

      thus when a fearful stag is closd around
      with crimson toils or in a river found
      high on the bank the deepmouthd hound appears
      still opening following still whereer he steers
      the persecuted creature to and fro
      turns here and there to scape his umbrian foe
      steep is th ascent and if he gains the land
      the purple death is pitchd along the strand
      his eager foe determind to the chase
      stretchd at his length gains ground at evry pace
      now to his beamy head he makes his way
      and now he holds or thinks he holds his prey
      just at the pinch the stag springs out with fear
      he bites the wind and fills his sounding jaws with air
      the rocks the lakes the meadows ring with cries
      the mortal tumult mounts and thunders in the skies
      thus flies the daunian prince and flying blames
      his tardy troops and calling by their names
      demands his trusty sword the trojan threats
      the realm with ruin and their ancient seats
      to lay in ashes if they dare supply
      with arms or aid his vanquishd enemy
      thus menacing he still pursues the course
      with vigour tho diminishd of his force
      ten times already round the listed place
      one chief had fled and t other givn the chase
      no trivial prize is playd for on the life
      or death of turnus now depends the strife

      within the space an olive tree had stood
      a sacred shade a venerable wood
      for vows to faunus paid the latins guardian god
      here hung the vests and tablets were engravd
      of sinking mariners from shipwreck savd
      with heedless hands the trojans felld the tree
      to make the ground enclosd for combat free
      deep in the root whether by fate or chance
      or erring haste the trojan drove his lance
      then stoopd and tuggd with force immense to free
      th incumberd spear from the tenacious tree
      that whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain
      his flying weapon might from far attain

      confusd with fear bereft of human aid
      then turnus to the gods and first to faunus prayd
      o faunus pity and thou mother earth
      where i thy foster son receivd my birth
      hold fast the steel if my religious hand
      your plant has honourd which your foes profand
      propitious hear my pious prayr he said
      nor with successless vows invokd their aid
      th incumbent hero wrenchd and pulld and straind
      but still the stubborn earth the steel detaind
      juturna took her time and while in vain
      he strove assumd meticus form again
      and in that imitated shape restord
      to the despairing prince his daunian sword
      the queen of love who with disdain and grief
      saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief
      t assert her offspring with a greater deed
      from the tough root the lingring weapon freed

      once more erect the rival chiefs advance
      one trusts the sword and one the pointed lance
      and both resolvd alike to try their fatal chance

      meantime imperial jove to juno spoke
      who from a shining cloud beheld the shock
      what new arrest o queen of heavn is sent
      to stop the fates now labring in th event
      what farther hopes are left thee to pursue
      divine aeneas 
      foredoomd to these celestial seats are due
      what more attempts for turnus can be made
      that thus thou lingrest in this lonely shade
      is it becoming of the due respect
      and awful honour of a god elect
      a wound unworthy of our state to feel
      patient of human hands and earthly steel
      or seems it just the sister should restore
      a second sword when one was lost before
      and arm a conquerd wretch against his conqueror
      for what without thy knowledge and avow
      nay more thy dictate durst juturna do
      at last in deference to my love forbear
      to lodge within thy soul this anxious care
      reclind upon my breast thy grief unload
      who should relieve the goddess but the god
      now all things to their utmost issue tend
      pushd by the fates to their appointed end
      while leave was givn thee and a lawful hour
      for vengeance wrath and unresisted powr
      tossd on the seas thou couldst thy foes distress
      and drivn ashore with hostile arms oppress
      deform the royal house and from the side
      of the just bridegroom tear the plighted bride
      now cease at my command the thundrer said
      and with dejected eyes this answer juno made
      because your dread decree too well i knew
      from turnus and from earth unwilling i withdrew
      else should you not behold me here alone
      involvd in empty clouds my friends bemoan
      but girt with vengeful flames in open sight
      engagd against my foes in mortal fight
      tis true juturna mingled in the strife
      by my command to save her brothers life
      at least to try but by the stygian lake
      
      with this restriction not to bend the bow
      or toss the spear or trembling dart to throw
      and now resignd to your superior might
      and tird with fruitless toils i loathe the fight
      this let me beg 
      both for myself and for your fathers land
      that when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace
      
      the laws of either nation be the same
      but let the latins still retain their name
      speak the same language which they spoke before
      wear the same habits which their grandsires wore
      call them not trojans perish the renown
      and name of troy with that detested town
      latium be latium still let alba reign
      and romes immortal majesty remain

      then thus the founder of mankind replies
      
      can saturns issue and heavns other heir
      such endless anger in her bosom bear
      be mistress and your full desires obtain
      but quench the choler you foment in vain
      from ancient blood th ausonian people sprung
      shall keep their name their habit and their tongue
      the trojans to their customs shall be tied
      i will myself their common rites provide
      the natives shall command the foreigners subside
      all shall be latium troy without a name
      and her lost sons forget from whence they came
      from blood so mixd a pious race shall flow
      equal to gods excelling all below
      no nation more respect to you shall pay
      or greater offrings on your altars lay
      juno consents well pleasd that her desires
      had found success and from the cloud retires

      the peace thus made the thundrer next prepares
      to force the watry goddess from the wars
      deep in the dismal regions void of light
      three daughters at a birth were born to night
      these their brown mother brooding on her care
      indued with windy wings to flit in air
      with serpents girt alike and crownd with hissing hair
      in heavn the dirae calld and still at hand
      before the throne of angry jove they stand
      his ministers of wrath and ready still
      the minds of mortal men with fears to fill
      wheneer the moody sire to wreak his hate
      on realms or towns deserving of their fate
      hurls down diseases death and deadly care
      and terrifies the guilty world with war
      one sister plague if these from heavn he sent
      to fright juturna with a dire portent
      the pest comes whirling down by far more slow
      springs the swift arrow from the parthian bow
      or cydon yew when traversing the skies
      and drenchd in poisnous juice the sure destruction flies
      with such a sudden and unseen a flight
      shot thro the clouds the daughter of the night
      soon as the field inclosd she had in view
      and from afar her destind quarry knew
      contracted to the boding bird she turns
      which haunts the ruind piles and hallowd urns
      and beats about the tombs with nightly wings
      where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings
      thus lessend in her form with frightful cries
      the fury round unhappy turnus flies
      flaps on his shield and flutters oer his eyes

      a lazy chillness crept along his blood
      chokd was his voice his hair with horror stood
      juturna from afar beheld her fly
      and knew th ill omen by her screaming cry
      and stridor of her wings amazd with fear
      her beauteous breast she beat and rent her flowing hair

      ah me she cries in this unequal strife
      what can thy sister more to save thy life
      weak as i am can i alas contend
      in arms with that inexorable fiend
      now now i quit the field forbear to fright
      my tender soul ye baleful birds of night
      the lashing of your wings i know too well
      the sounding flight and funral screams of hell
      these are the gifts you bring from haughty jove
      the worthy recompense of ravishd love
      did he for this exempt my life from fate
      o hard conditions of immortal state
      tho born to death not privilegd to die
      but forcd to bear imposd eternity
      take back your envious bribes and let me go
      companion to my brothers ghost below
      the joys are vanishd nothing now remains
      of life immortal but immortal pains
      what earth will open her devouring womb
      to rest a weary goddess in the tomb
      she drew a length of sighs nor more she said
      but in her azure mantle wrappd her head
      then plungd into her stream with deep despair
      and her last sobs came bubbling up in air

      now stern aeneas waves his weighty spear
      against his foe and thus upbraids his fear
      what farther subterfuge can turnus find
      what empty hopes are harbourd in his mind
      tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight
      not with their feet but hands the valiant fight
      vary thy shape in thousand forms and dare
      what skill and courage can attempt in war
      wish for the wings of winds to mount the sky
      or hid within the hollow earth to lie
      the champion shook his head and made this short reply
      no threats of thine my manly mind can move
      tis hostile heavn i dread and partial jove
      he said no more but with a sigh repressd
      the mighty sorrow in his swelling breast

      then as he rolld his troubled eyes around
      an antique stone he saw the common bound
      of neighbring fields and barrier of the ground
      so vast that twelve strong men of modern days
      th enormous weight from earth could hardly raise
      he heavd it at a lift and poisd on high
      ran staggring on against his enemy
      but so disorderd that he scarcely knew
      his way or what unwieldly weight he threw
      his knocking knees are bent beneath the load
      and shivring cold congeals his vital blood
      the stone drops from his arms and falling short
      for want of vigour mocks his vain effort
      and as when heavy sleep has closd the sight
      the sickly fancy labours in the night
      we seem to run and destitute of force
      our sinking limbs forsake us in the course
      in vain we heave for breath in vain we cry
      the nerves unbracd their usual strength deny
      and on the tongue the faltring accents die
      so turnus fard whatever means he tried
      all force of arms and points of art employd
      the fury flew athwart and made th endeavor void

      a thousand various thoughts his soul confound
      he stard about nor aid nor issue found
      his own men stop the pass and his own walls surround
      once more he pauses and looks out again
      and seeks the goddess charioteer in vain
      trembling he views the thundring chief advance
      and brandishing aloft the deadly lance
      amazd he cowrs beneath his conquring foe
      forgets to ward and waits the coming blow
      astonishd while he stands and fixd with fear
      aimd at his shield he sees th impending spear

      the hero measurd first with narrow view
      the destind mark and rising as he threw
      with its full swing the fatal weapon flew
      not with less rage the rattling thunder falls
      or stones from battringengines break the walls
      swift as a whirlwind from an arm so strong
      the lance drove on and bore the death along
      naught could his sevnfold shield the prince avail
      nor aught beneath his arms the coat of mail
      it piercd thro all and with a grisly wound
      transfixd his thigh and doubled him to ground
      with groans the latins rend the vaulted sky
      woods hills and valleys to the voice reply

      now low on earth the lofty chief is laid
      with eyes cast upward and with arms displayd
      and recreant thus to the proud victor prayd
      i know my death deservd nor hope to live
      use what the gods and thy good fortune give
      yet think o think if mercy may be shown
      thou hadst a father once and hast a son
      pity my sire now sinking to the grave
      and for anchises sake old daunus save
      or if thy vowd revenge pursue my death
      give to my friends my body void of breath
      the latian chiefs have seen me beg my life
      thine is the conquest thine the royal wife
      against a yielded man tis mean ignoble strife

      in deep suspense the trojan seemd to stand
      and just prepard to strike repressd his hand
      he rolld his eyes and evry moment felt
      his manly soul with more compassion melt
      when casting down a casual glance he spied
      the golden belt that glitterd on his side
      the fatal spoils which haughty turnus tore
      from dying pallas and in triumph wore
      then rousd anew to wrath he loudly cries
      
      traitor dost thou dost thou to grace pretend
      clad as thou art in trophies of my friend
      to his sad soul a grateful offring go
      tis pallas pallas gives this deadly blow
      he raisd his arm aloft and at the word
      deep in his bosom drove the shining sword
      the streaming blood distaind his arms around
      and the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound


midway upon the journey of our life
    i found myself within a forest dark
    for the straightforward pathway had been lost

ah me how hard a thing it is to say
    what was this forest savage rough and stern
    which in the very thought renews the fear

so bitter is it death is little more
    but of the good to treat which there i found
    speak will i of the other things i saw there

i cannot well repeat how there i entered
    so full was i of slumber at the moment
    in which i had abandoned the true way

but after i had reached a mountains foot
    at that point where the valley terminated
    which had with consternation pierced my heart

upward i looked and i beheld its shoulders
    vested already with that planets rays
    which leadeth others right by every road

then was the fear a little quieted
    that in my hearts lake had endured throughout
    the night which i had passed so piteously

and even as he who with distressful breath
    forth issued from the sea upon the shore
    turns to the water perilous and gazes

so did my soul that still was fleeing onward
    turn itself back to rebehold the pass
    which never yet a living person left

after my weary body i had rested
    the way resumed i on the desert slope
    so that the firm foot ever was the lower

and lo almost where the ascent began
    a panther light and swift exceedingly
    which with a spotted skin was covered oer

and never moved she from before my face
    nay rather did impede so much my way
    that many times i to return had turned

the time was the beginning of the morning
    and up the sun was mounting with those stars
    that with him were what time the love divine

at first in motion set those beauteous things
    so were to me occasion of good hope
    the variegated skin of that wild beast

the hour of time and the delicious season
    but not so much that did not give me fear
    a lions aspect which appeared to me

he seemed as if against me he were coming
    with head uplifted and with ravenous hunger
    so that it seemed the air was afraid of him

and a shewolf that with all hungerings
    seemed to be laden in her meagreness
    and many folk has caused to live forlorn

she brought upon me so much heaviness
    with the affright that from her aspect came
    that i the hope relinquished of the height

and as he is who willingly acquires
    and the time comes that causes him to lose
    who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent

een such made me that beast withouten peace
    which coming on against me by degrees
    thrust me back thither where the sun is silent

while i was rushing downward to the lowland
    before mine eyes did one present himself
    who seemed from longcontinued silence hoarse

when i beheld him in the desert vast
    have pity on me unto him i cried
    whicheer thou art or shade or real man

he answered me not man man once i was
    and both my parents were of lombardy
    and mantuans by country both of them

sub julio was i born though it was late
    and lived at rome under the good augustus
    during the time of false and lying gods

a poet was i and i sang that just
    son of anchises who came forth from troy
    after that ilion the superb was burned

but thou why goest thou back to such annoyance
    why climbst thou not the mount delectable
    which is the source and cause of every joy

now art thou that virgilius and that fountain
    which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech
    i made response to him with bashful forehead

o of the other poets honour and light
    avail me the long study and great love
    that have impelled me to explore thy volume

thou art my master and my author thou
    thou art alone the one from whom i took
    the beautiful style that has done honour to me

behold the beast for which i have turned back
    do thou protect me from her famous sage
    for she doth make my veins and pulses tremble

thee it behoves to take another road
    responded he when he beheld me weeping
    if from this savage place thou wouldst escape

because this beast at which thou criest out
    suffers not any one to pass her way
    but so doth harass him that she destroys him

and has a nature so malign and ruthless
    that never doth she glut her greedy will
    and after food is hungrier than before

many the animals with whom she weds
    and more they shall be still until the greyhound
    comes who shall make her perish in her pain

he shall not feed on either earth or pelf
    but upon wisdom and on love and virtue
    twixt feltro and feltro shall his nation be

of that low italy shall he be the saviour
    on whose account the maid camilla died
    euryalus turnus nisus of their wounds

through every city shall he hunt her down
    until he shall have driven her back to hell
    there from whence envy first did let her loose

therefore i think and judge it for thy best
    thou follow me and i will be thy guide
    and lead thee hence through the eternal place

where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations
    shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate
    who cry out each one for the second death

and thou shalt see those who contented are
    within the fire because they hope to come
    wheneer it may be to the blessed people

to whom then if thou wishest to ascend
    a soul shall be for that than i more worthy
    with her at my departure i will leave thee

because that emperor who reigns above
    in that i was rebellious to his law
    wills that through me none come into his city

he governs everywhere and there he reigns
    there is his city and his lofty throne
    o happy he whom thereto he elects

and i to him poet i thee entreat
    by that same god whom thou didst never know
    so that i may escape this woe and worse

thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said
    that i may see the portal of saint peter
    and those thou makest so disconsolate

then he moved on and i behind him followed






day was departing and the embrowned air
    released the animals that are on earth
    from their fatigues and i the only one

made myself ready to sustain the war
    both of the way and likewise of the woe
    which memory that errs not shall retrace

o muses o high genius now assist me
    o memory that didst write down what i saw
    here thy nobility shall be manifest

and i began poet who guidest me
    regard my manhood if it be sufficient
    ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me

thou sayest that of silvius the parent
    while yet corruptible unto the world
    immortal went and was there bodily

but if the adversary of all evil
    was courteous thinking of the high effect
    that issue would from him and who and what

to men of intellect unmeet it seems not
    for he was of great rome and of her empire
    in the empyreal heaven as father chosen

the which and what wishing to speak the truth
    were stablished as the holy place wherein
    sits the successor of the greatest peter

upon this journey whence thou givest him vaunt
    things did he hear which the occasion were
    both of his victory and the papal mantle

thither went afterwards the chosen vessel
    to bring back comfort thence unto that faith
    which of salvations way is the beginning

but i why thither come or who concedes it
    i not aeneas am i am not paul
    nor i nor others think me worthy of it

therefore if i resign myself to come
    i fear the coming may be illadvised
    thourt wise and knowest better than i speak

and as he is who unwills what he willed
    and by new thoughts doth his intention change
    so that from his design he quite withdraws

such i became upon that dark hillside
    because in thinking i consumed the emprise
    which was so very prompt in the beginning

if i have well thy language understood
    replied that shade of the magnanimous
    thy soul attainted is with cowardice

which many times a man encumbers so
    it turns him back from honoured enterprise
    as false sight doth a beast when he is shy

that thou mayst free thee from this apprehension
    ill tell thee why i came and what i heard
    at the first moment when i grieved for thee

among those was i who are in suspense
    and a fair saintly lady called to me
    in such wise i besought her to command me

her eyes where shining brighter than the star
    and she began to say gentle and low
    with voice angelical in her own language

o spirit courteous of mantua
    of whom the fame still in the world endures
    and shall endure longlasting as the world

a friend of mine and not the friend of fortune
    upon the desert slope is so impeded
    upon his way that he has turned through terror

and may i fear already be so lost
    that i too late have risen to his succour
    from that which i have heard of him in heaven

bestir thee now and with thy speech ornate
    and with what needful is for his release
    assist him so that i may be consoled

beatrice am i who do bid thee go
    i come from there where i would fain return
    love moved me which compelleth me to speak

when i shall be in presence of my lord
    full often will i praise thee unto him
    then paused she and thereafter i began

o lady of virtue thou alone through whom
    the human race exceedeth all contained
    within the heaven that has the lesser circles

so grateful unto me is thy commandment
    to obey if twere already done were late
    no farther needst thou ope to me thy wish

but the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
    the here descending down into this centre
    from the vast place thou burnest to return to

since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern
    briefly will i relate she answered me
    why i am not afraid to enter here

of those things only should one be afraid
    which have the power of doing others harm
    of the rest no because they are not fearful

god in his mercy such created me
    that misery of yours attains me not
    nor any flame assails me of this burning

a gentle lady is in heaven who grieves
    at this impediment to which i send thee
    so that stern judgment there above is broken

in her entreaty she besought lucia
    and said thy faithful one now stands in need
    of thee and unto thee i recommend him

lucia foe of all that cruel is
    hastened away and came unto the place
    where i was sitting with the ancient rachel

beatrice said she the true praise of god
    why succourest thou not him who loved thee so
    for thee he issued from the vulgar herd

dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint
    dost thou not see the death that combats him
    beside that flood where ocean has no vaunt

never were persons in the world so swift
    to work their weal and to escape their woe
    as i after such words as these were uttered

came hither downward from my blessed seat
    confiding in thy dignified discourse
    which honours thee and those whove listened to it

after she thus had spoken unto me
    weeping her shining eyes she turned away
    whereby she made me swifter in my coming

and unto thee i came as she desired
    i have delivered thee from that wild beast
    which barred the beautiful mountains short ascent

what is it then  why why dost thou delay
    why is such baseness bedded in thy heart
    daring and hardihood why hast thou not

seeing that three such ladies benedight
    are caring for thee in the court of heaven
    and so much good my speech doth promise thee

even as the flowerets by nocturnal chill
    bowed down and closed when the sun whitens them
    uplift themselves all open on their stems

such i became with my exhausted strength
    and such good courage to my heart there coursed
    that i began like an intrepid person

o she compassionate who succoured me
    and courteous thou who hast obeyed so soon
    the words of truth which she addressed to thee

thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
    to the adventure with these words of thine
    that to my first intent i have returned

now go for one sole will is in us both
    thou leader and thou lord and master thou
    thus said i to him and when he had moved

i entered on the deep and savage way







through me the way is to the city dolent
    through me the way is to eternal dole
    through me the way among the people lost

justice incited my sublime creator
    created me divine omnipotence
    the highest wisdom and the primal love

before me there were no created things
    only eterne and i eternal last
    all hope abandon ye who enter in

these words in sombre colour i beheld
    written upon the summit of a gate
    whence i their sense is master hard to me

and he to me as one experienced
    here all suspicion needs must be abandoned
    all cowardice must needs be here extinct

we to the place have come where i have told thee
    thou shalt behold the people dolorous
    who have foregone the good of intellect

and after he had laid his hand on mine
    with joyful mien whence i was comforted
    he led me in among the secret things

there sighs complaints and ululations loud
    resounded through the air without a star
    whence i at the beginning wept thereat

languages diverse horrible dialects
    accents of anger words of agony
    and voices high and hoarse with sound of hands

made up a tumult that goes whirling on
    for ever in that air for ever black
    even as the sand doth when the whirlwind breathes

and i who had my head with horror bound
    said master what is this which now i hear
    what folk is this which seems by pain so vanquished

and he to me this miserable mode
    maintain the melancholy souls of those
    who lived withouten infamy or praise

commingled are they with that caitiff choir
    of angels who have not rebellious been
    nor faithful were to god but were for self

the heavens expelled them not to be less fair
    nor them the nethermore abyss receives
    for glory none the damned would have from them

and i o master what so grievous is
    to these that maketh them lament so sore
    he answered i will tell thee very briefly

these have no longer any hope of death
    and this blind life of theirs is so debased
    they envious are of every other fate

no fame of them the world permits to be
    misericord and justice both disdain them
    let us not speak of them but look and pass

and i who looked again beheld a banner
    which whirling round ran on so rapidly
    that of all pause it seemed to me indignant

and after it there came so long a train
    of people that i neer would have believed
    that ever death so many had undone

when some among them i had recognised
    i looked and i beheld the shade of him
    who made through cowardice the great refusal

forthwith i comprehended and was certain
    that this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
    hateful to god and to his enemies

these miscreants who never were alive
    were naked and were stung exceedingly
    by gadflies and by hornets that were there

these did their faces irrigate with blood
    which with their tears commingled at their feet
    by the disgusting worms was gathered up

and when to gazing farther i betook me
    people i saw on a great rivers bank
    whence said i master now vouchsafe to me

that i may know who these are and what law
    makes them appear so ready to pass over
    as i discern athwart the dusky light

and he to me these things shall all be known
    to thee as soon as we our footsteps stay
    upon the dismal shore of acheron

then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast
    fearing my words might irksome be to him
    from speech refrained i till we reached the river

and lo towards us coming in a boat
    an old man hoary with the hair of eld
    crying woe unto you ye souls depraved

hope nevermore to look upon the heavens
    i come to lead you to the other shore
    to the eternal shades in heat and frost

and thou that yonder standest living soul
    withdraw thee from these people who are dead
    but when he saw that i did not withdraw

he said by other ways by other ports
    thou to the shore shalt come not here for passage
    a lighter vessel needs must carry thee

and unto him the guide vex thee not charon
    it is so willed there where is power to do
    that which is willed and farther question not

thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
    of him the ferryman of the livid fen
    who round about his eyes had wheels of flame

but all those souls who weary were and naked
    their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together
    as soon as they had heard those cruel words

god they blasphemed and their progenitors
    the human race the place the time the seed
    of their engendering and of their birth

thereafter all together they drew back
    bitterly weeping to the accursed shore
    which waiteth every man who fears not god

charon the demon with the eyes of glede
    beckoning to them collects them all together
    beats with his oar whoever lags behind

as in the autumntime the leaves fall off
    first one and then another till the branch
    unto the earth surrenders all its spoils

in similar wise the evil seed of adam
    throw themselves from that margin one by one
    at signals as a bird unto its lure

so they depart across the dusky wave
    and ere upon the other side they land
    again on this side a new troop assembles

my son the courteous master said to me
    all those who perish in the wrath of god
    here meet together out of every land

and ready are they to pass oer the river
    because celestial justice spurs them on
    so that their fear is turned into desire

this way there never passes a good soul
    and hence if charon doth complain of thee
    well mayst thou know now what his speech imports

this being finished all the dusk champaign
    trembled so violently that of that terror
    the recollection bathes me still with sweat

the land of tears gave forth a blast of wind
    and fulminated a vermilion light
    which overmastered in me every sense

and as a man whom sleep hath seized i fell






broke the deep lethargy within my head
    a heavy thunder so that i upstarted
    like to a person who by force is wakened

and round about i moved my rested eyes
    uprisen erect and steadfastly i gazed
    to recognise the place wherein i was

true is it that upon the verge i found me
    of the abysmal valley dolorous
    that gathers thunder of infinite ululations

obscure profound it was and nebulous
    so that by fixing on its depths my sight
    nothing whatever i discerned therein

let us descend now into the blind world
    began the poet pallid utterly
    i will be first and thou shalt second be

and i who of his colour was aware
    said how shall i come if thou art afraid
    whort wont to be a comfort to my fears

and he to me the anguish of the people
    who are below here in my face depicts
    that pity which for terror thou hast taken

let us go on for the long way impels us
    thus he went in and thus he made me enter
    the foremost circle that surrounds the abyss

there as it seemed to me from listening
    were lamentations none but only sighs
    that tremble made the everlasting air

and this arose from sorrow without torment
    which the crowds had that many were and great
    of infants and of women and of men

to me the master good thou dost not ask
    what spirits these which thou beholdest are
    now will i have thee know ere thou go farther

that they sinned not and if they merit had
    tis not enough because they had not baptism
    which is the portal of the faith thou holdest

and if they were before christianity
    in the right manner they adored not god
    and among such as these am i myself

for such defects and not for other guilt
    lost are we and are only so far punished
    that without hope we live on in desire

great grief seized on my heart when this i heard
    because some people of much worthiness
    i knew who in that limbo were suspended

tell me my master tell me thou my lord
    began i with desire of being certain
    of that faith which oercometh every error

came any one by his own merit hence
    or by anothers who was blessed thereafter
    and he who understood my covert speech

replied i was a novice in this state
    when i saw hither come a mighty one
    with sign of victory incoronate

hence he drew forth the shade of the first parent
    and that of his son abel and of noah
    of moses the lawgiver and the obedient

abraham patriarch and david king
    israel with his father and his children
    and rachel for whose sake he did so much

and others many and he made them blessed
    and thou must know that earlier than these
    never were any human spirits saved

we ceased not to advance because he spake
    but still were passing onward through the forest
    the forest say i of thickcrowded ghosts

not very far as yet our way had gone
    this side the summit when i saw a fire
    that overcame a hemisphere of darkness

we were a little distant from it still
    but not so far that i in part discerned not
    that honourable people held that place

o thou who honourest every art and science
    who may these be which such great honour have
    that from the fashion of the rest it parts them

and he to me the honourable name
    that sounds of them above there in thy life
    wins grace in heaven that so advances them

in the mean time a voice was heard by me
    all honour be to the preeminent poet
    his shade returns again that was departed

after the voice had ceased and quiet was
    four mighty shades i saw approaching us
    semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad

to say to me began my gracious master
    him with that falchion in his hand behold
    who comes before the three even as their lord

that one is homer poet sovereign
    he who comes next is horace the satirist
    the third is ovid and the last is lucan

because to each of these with me applies
    the name that solitary voice proclaimed
    they do me honour and in that do well

thus i beheld assemble the fair school
    of that lord of the song preeminent
    who oer the others like an eagle soars

when they together had discoursed somewhat
    they turned to me with signs of salutation
    and on beholding this my master smiled

and more of honour still much more they did me
    in that they made me one of their own band
    so that the sixth was i mid so much wit

thus we went on as far as to the light
    things saying tis becoming to keep silent
    as was the saying of them where i was

we came unto a noble castles foot
    seven times encompassed with lofty walls
    defended round by a fair rivulet

this we passed over even as firm ground
    through portals seven i entered with these sages
    we came into a meadow of fresh verdure

people were there with solemn eyes and slow
    of great authority in their countenance
    they spake but seldom and with gentle voices

thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
    into an opening luminous and lofty
    so that they all of them were visible

there opposite upon the green enamel
    were pointed out to me the mighty spirits
    whom to have seen i feel myself exalted

i saw electra with companions many
    mongst whom i knew both hector and aeneas
    caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes

i saw camilla and penthesilea
    on the other side and saw the king latinus
    who with lavinia his daughter sat

i saw that brutus who drove tarquin forth
    lucretia julia marcia and cornelia
    and saw alone apart the saladin

when i had lifted up my brows a little
    the master i beheld of those who know
    sit with his philosophic family

all gaze upon him and all do him honour
    there i beheld both socrates and plato
    who nearer him before the others stand

democritus who puts the world on chance
    diogenes anaxagoras and thales
    zeno empedocles and heraclitus

of qualities i saw the good collector
    hight dioscorides and orpheus saw i
    tully and livy and moral seneca

euclid geometrician and ptolemy
    galen hippocrates and avicenna
    averroes who the great comment made

i cannot all of them pourtray in full
    because so drives me onward the long theme
    that many times the word comes short of fact

the sixfold company in two divides
    another way my sapient guide conducts me
    forth from the quiet to the air that trembles

and to a place i come where nothing shines






thus i descended out of the first circle
    down to the second that less space begirds
    and so much greater dole that goads to wailing

there standeth minos horribly and snarls
    examines the transgressions at the entrance
    judges and sends according as he girds him

i say that when the spirit evilborn
    cometh before him wholly it confesses
    and this discriminator of transgressions

seeth what place in hell is meet for it
    girds himself with his tail as many times
    as grades he wishes it should be thrust down

always before him many of them stand
    they go by turns each one unto the judgment
    they speak and hear and then are downward hurled

o thou that to this dolorous hostelry
    comest said minos to me when he saw me
    leaving the practice of so great an office

look how thou enterest and in whom thou trustest
    let not the portals amplitude deceive thee
    and unto him my guide why criest thou too

do not impede his journey fateordained
    it is so willed there where is power to do
    that which is willed and ask no further question

and now begin the dolesome notes to grow
    audible unto me now am i come
    there where much lamentation strikes upon me

i came into a place mute of all light
    which bellows as the sea does in a tempest
    if by opposing winds t is combated

the infernal hurricane that never rests
    hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine
    whirling them round and smiting it molests them

when they arrive before the precipice
    there are the shrieks the plaints and the laments
    there they blaspheme the puissance divine

i understood that unto such a torment
    the carnal malefactors were condemned
    who reason subjugate to appetite

and as the wings of starlings bear them on
    in the cold season in large band and full
    so doth that blast the spirits maledict

it hither thither downward upward drives them
    no hope doth comfort them for evermore
    not of repose but even of lesser pain

and as the cranes go chanting forth their lays
    making in air a long line of themselves
    so saw i coming uttering lamentations

shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress
    whereupon said i master who are those
    people whom the black air so castigates

the first of those of whom intelligence
    thou fain wouldst have then said he unto me
    the empress was of many languages

to sensual vices she was so abandoned
    that lustful she made licit in her law
    to remove the blame to which she had been led

she is semiramis of whom we read
    that she succeeded ninus and was his spouse
    she held the land which now the sultan rules

the next is she who killed herself for love
    and broke faith with the ashes of sichaeus
    then cleopatra the voluptuous

helen i saw for whom so many ruthless
    seasons revolved and saw the great achilles
    who at the last hour combated with love

paris i saw tristan and more than a thousand
    shades did he name and point out with his finger
    whom love had separated from our life

after that i had listened to my teacher
    naming the dames of eld and cavaliers
    pity prevailed and i was nigh bewildered

and i began o poet willingly
    speak would i to those two who go together
    and seem upon the wind to be so light

and he to me thoult mark when they shall be
    nearer to us and then do thou implore them
    by love which leadeth them and they will come

soon as the wind in our direction sways them
    my voice uplift i o ye weary souls
    come speak to us if no one interdicts it

as turtledoves called onward by desire
    with open and steady wings to the sweet nest
    fly through the air by their volition borne

so came they from the band where dido is
    approaching us athwart the air malign
    so strong was the affectionate appeal

o living creature gracious and benignant
    who visiting goest through the purple air
    us who have stained the world incarnadine

if were the king of the universe our friend
    we would pray unto him to give thee peace
    since thou hast pity on our woe perverse

of what it pleases thee to hear and speak
    that will we hear and we will speak to you
    while silent is the wind as it is now

sitteth the city wherein i was born
    upon the seashore where the po descends
    to rest in peace with all his retinue

love that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize
    seized this man for the person beautiful
    that was taen from me and still the mode offends me

love that exempts no one beloved from loving
    seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly
    that as thou seest it doth not yet desert me

love has conducted us unto one death
    caina waiteth him who quenched our life
    these words were borne along from them to us

as soon as i had heard those souls tormented
    i bowed my face and so long held it down
    until the poet said to me what thinkest

when i made answer i began alas
    how many pleasant thoughts how much desire
    conducted these unto the dolorous pass

then unto them i turned me and i spake
    and i began thine agonies francesca
    sad and compassionate to weeping make me

but tell me at the time of those sweet sighs
    by what and in what manner love conceded
    that you should know your dubious desires

and she to me there is no greater sorrow
    than to be mindful of the happy time
    in misery and that thy teacher knows

but if to recognise the earliest root
    of love in us thou hast so great desire
    i will do even as he who weeps and speaks

one day we reading were for our delight
    of launcelot how love did him enthral
    alone we were and without any fear

full many a time our eyes together drew
    that reading and drove the colour from our faces
    but one point only was it that oercame us

when as we read of the muchlongedfor smile
    being by such a noble lover kissed
    this one who neer from me shall be divided

kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating
    galeotto was the book and he who wrote it
    that day no farther did we read therein

and all the while one spirit uttered this
    the other one did weep so that for pity
    i swooned away as if i had been dying

and fell even as a dead body falls







at the return of consciousness that closed
    before the pity of those two relations
    which utterly with sadness had confused me

new torments i behold and new tormented
    around me whichsoever way i move
    and whichsoever way i turn and gaze

in the third circle am i of the rain
    eternal maledict and cold and heavy
    its law and quality are never new

huge hail and water sombrehued and snow
    athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain
    noisome the earth is that receiveth this

cerberus monster cruel and uncouth
    with his three gullets like a dog is barking
    over the people that are there submerged

red eyes he has and unctuous beard and black
    and belly large and armed with claws his hands
    he rends the spirits flays and quarters them

howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs
    one side they make a shelter for the other
    oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates

when cerberus perceived us the great worm
     his mouths he opened and displayed his tusks
     not a limb had he that was motionless

and my conductor with his spans extended
    took of the earth and with his fists well filled
    he threw it into those rapacious gullets

such as that dog is who by barking craves
    and quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws
    for to devour it he but thinks and struggles

the like became those muzzles filthbegrimed
    of cerberus the demon who so thunders
    over the souls that they would fain be deaf

we passed across the shadows which subdues
    the heavy rainstorm and we placed our feet
    upon their vanity that person seems

they all were lying prone upon the earth
    excepting one who sat upright as soon
    as he beheld us passing on before him

o thou that art conducted through this hell
    he said to me recall me if thou canst
    thyself wast made before i was unmade

and i to him the anguish which thou hast
    perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance
    so that it seems not i have ever seen thee

but tell me who thou art that in so doleful
    a place art put and in such punishment
    if some are greater none is so displeasing

and he to me thy city which is full
    of envy so that now the sack runs over
    held me within it in the life serene

you citizens were wont to call me ciacco
    for the pernicious sin of gluttony
    i as thou seest am battered by this rain

and i sad soul am not the only one
    for all these suffer the like penalty
    for the like sin and word no more spake he

i answered him ciacco thy wretchedness
    weighs on me so that it to weep invites me
    but tell me if thou knowest to what shall come

the citizens of the divided city
    if any there be just and the occasion
    tell me why so much discord has assailed it

and he to me they after long contention
    will come to bloodshed and the rustic party
    will drive the other out with much offence

then afterwards behoves it this one fall
    within three suns and rise again the other
    by force of him who now is on the coast

high will it hold its forehead a long while
    keeping the other under heavy burdens
    howeer it weeps thereat and is indignant

the just are two and are not understood there
    envy and arrogance and avarice
    are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled

here ended he his tearful utterance
    and i to him i wish thee still to teach me
    and make a gift to me of further speech

farinata and tegghiaio once so worthy
    jacopo rusticucci arrigo and mosca
    and others who on good deeds set their thoughts

say where they are and cause that i may know them
    for great desire constraineth me to learn
    if heaven doth sweeten them or hell envenom

and he they are among the blacker souls
    a different sin downweighs them to the bottom
    if thou so far descendest thou canst see them

but when thou art again in the sweet world
    i pray thee to the mind of others bring me
    no more i tell thee and no more i answer

then his straightforward eyes he turned askance
    eyed me a little and then bowed his head
    he fell therewith prone like the other blind

and the guide said to me he wakes no more
    this side the sound of the angelic trumpet
    when shall approach the hostile potentate

each one shall find again his dismal tomb
    shall reassume his flesh and his own figure
    shall hear what through eternity reechoes

so we passed onward oer the filthy mixture
    of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow
    touching a little on the future life

wherefore i said master these torments here
    will they increase after the mighty sentence
    or lesser be or will they be as burning

and he to me return unto thy science
    which wills that as the thing more perfect is
    the more it feels of pleasure and of pain

albeit that this people maledict
    to true perfection never can attain
    hereafter more than now they look to be

round in a circle by that road we went
    speaking much more which i do not repeat
    we came unto the point where the descent is

there we found plutus the great enemy







pape satan pape satan aleppe
    thus plutus with his clucking voice began
    and that benignant sage who all things knew

said to encourage me let not thy fear
    harm thee for any power that he may have
    shall not prevent thy going down this crag

then he turned round unto that bloated lip
    and said be silent thou accursed wolf
    consume within thyself with thine own rage

not causeless is this journey to the abyss
    thus is it willed on high where michael wrought
    vengeance upon the proud adultery

even as the sails inflated by the wind
    involved together fall when snaps the mast
    so fell the cruel monster to the earth

thus we descended into the fourth chasm
    gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
    which all the woe of the universe insacks

justice of god ah who heaps up so many
    new toils and sufferings as i beheld
    and why doth our transgression waste us so

as doth the billow there upon charybdis
    that breaks itself on that which it encounters
    so here the folk must dance their roundelay

here saw i people more than elsewhere many
    on one side and the other with great howls
    rolling weights forward by main force of chest

they clashed together and then at that point
    each one turned backward rolling retrograde
    crying why keepest and why squanderest thou

thus they returned along the lurid circle
    on either hand unto the opposite point
    shouting their shameful metre evermore

then each when he arrived there wheeled about
    through his halfcircle to another joust
    and i who had my heart pierced as it were

exclaimed my master now declare to me
    what people these are and if all were clerks
    these shaven crowns upon the left of us

and he to me all of them were asquint
    in intellect in the first life so much
    that there with measure they no spending made

clearly enough their voices bark it forth
    wheneer they reach the two points of the circle
    where sunders them the opposite defect

clerks those were who no hairy covering
    have on the head and popes and cardinals
    in whom doth avarice practise its excess

and i my master among such as these
    i ought forsooth to recognise some few
    who were infected with these maladies

and he to me vain thought thou entertainest
    the undiscerning life which made them sordid
    now makes them unto all discernment dim

forever shall they come to these two buttings
    these from the sepulchre shall rise again
    with the fist closed and these with tresses shorn

ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
    have taen from them and placed them in this scuffle
    whateer it be no words adorn i for it

now canst thou son behold the transient farce
    of goods that are committed unto fortune
    for which the human race each other buffet

for all the gold that is beneath the moon
    or ever has been of these weary souls
    could never make a single one repose

master i said to him now tell me also
    what is this fortune which thou speakest of
    that has the worlds goods so within its clutches

and he to me o creatures imbecile
    what ignorance is this which doth beset you
    now will i have thee learn my judgment of her

he whose omniscience everything transcends
    the heavens created and gave who should guide them
    that every part to every part may shine

distributing the light in equal measure
    he in like manner to the mundane splendours
    ordained a general ministress and guide

that she might change at times the empty treasures
    from race to race from one blood to another
    beyond resistance of all human wisdom

therefore one people triumphs and another
    languishes in pursuance of her judgment
    which hidden is as in the grass a serpent

your knowledge has no counterstand against her
    she makes provision judges and pursues
    her governance as theirs the other gods

her permutations have not any truce
    necessity makes her precipitate
    so often cometh who his turn obtains

and this is she who is so crucified
    even by those who ought to give her praise
    giving her blame amiss and bad repute

but she is blissful and she hears it not
    among the other primal creatures gladsome
    she turns her sphere and blissful she rejoices

let us descend now unto greater woe
    already sinks each star that was ascending
    when i set out and loitering is forbidden

we crossed the circle to the other bank
    near to a fount that boils and pours itself
    along a gully that runs out of it

the water was more sombre far than perse
    and we in company with the dusky waves
    made entrance downward by a path uncouth

a marsh it makes which has the name of styx
    this tristful brooklet when it has descended
    down to the foot of the malign gray shores

and i who stood intent upon beholding
    saw people mudbesprent in that lagoon
    all of them naked and with angry look

they smote each other not alone with hands
    but with the head and with the breast and feet
    tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth

said the good master son thou now beholdest
    the souls of those whom anger overcame
    and likewise i would have thee know for certain

beneath the water people are who sigh
    and make this water bubble at the surface
    as the eye tells thee wheresoeer it turns

fixed in the mire they say we sullen were
    in the sweet air which by the sun is gladdened
    bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek

now we are sullen in this sable mire
    this hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats
    for with unbroken words they cannot say it

thus we went circling round the filthy fen
    a great arc twixt the dry bank and the swamp
    with eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire

unto the foot of a tower we came at last







i say continuing that long before
    we to the foot of that high tower had come
    our eyes went upward to the summit of it

by reason of two flamelets we saw placed there
    and from afar another answer them
    so far that hardly could the eye attain it

and to the sea of all discernment turned
    i said what sayeth this and what respondeth
    that other fire and who are they that made it

and he to me across the turbid waves
    what is expected thou canst now discern
    if reek of the morass conceal it not

cord never shot an arrow from itself
    that sped away athwart the air so swift
    as i beheld a very little boat

come oer the water towrds us at that moment
    under the guidance of a single pilot
    who shouted now art thou arrived fell soul

phlegyas phlegyas thou criest out in vain
    for this once said my lord thou shalt not have us
    longer than in the passing of the slough

as he who listens to some great deceit
    that has been done to him and then resents it
    such became phlegyas in his gathered wrath

my guide descended down into the boat
    and then he made me enter after him
    and only when i entered seemed it laden

soon as the guide and i were in the boat
    the antique prow goes on its way dividing
    more of the water than tis wont with others

while we were running through the dead canal
    uprose in front of me one full of mire
    and said who rt thou that comest ere the hour

and i to him although i come i stay not
    but who art thou that hast become so squalid
    thou seest that i am one who weeps he answered

and i to him with weeping and with wailing
    thou spirit maledict do thou remain
    for thee i know though thou art all defiled

then stretched he both his hands unto the boat
    whereat my wary master thrust him back
    saying away there with the other dogs

thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck
    he kissed my face and said disdainful soul
    blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom

that was an arrogant person in the world
    goodness is none that decks his memory
    so likewise here his shade is furious

how many are esteemed great kings up there
    who here shall be like unto swine in mire
    leaving behind them horrible dispraises

and i my master much should i be pleased
    if i could see him soused into this broth
    before we issue forth out of the lake

and he to me ere unto thee the shore
    reveal itself thou shalt be satisfied
    such a desire tis meet thou shouldst enjoy

a little after that i saw such havoc
    made of him by the people of the mire
    that still i praise and thank my god for it

they all were shouting at philippo argenti
    and that exasperate spirit florentine
    turned round upon himself with his own teeth

we left him there and more of him i tell not
    but on mine ears there smote a lamentation
    whence forward i intent unbar mine eyes

and the good master said even now my son
    the city draweth near whose name is dis
    with the grave citizens with the great throng

and i its mosques already master clearly
    within there in the valley i discern
    vermilion as if issuing from the fire

they were  and he to me the fire eternal
    that kindles them within makes them look red
    as thou beholdest in this nether hell

then we arrived within the moats profound
    that circumvallate that disconsolate city
    the walls appeared to me to be of iron

not without making first a circuit wide
    we came unto a place where loud the pilot
    cried out to us debark here is the entrance

more than a thousand at the gates i saw
    out of the heavens rained down who angrily
    were saying who is this that without death

goes through the kingdom of the people dead
    and my sagacious master made a sign
    of wishing secretly to speak with them

a little then they quelled their great disdain
    and said come thou alone and he begone
    who has so boldly entered these dominions

let him return alone by his mad road
    try if he can for thou shalt here remain
    who hast escorted him through such dark regions

think reader if i was discomforted
    at utterance of the accursed words
    for never to return here i believed

o my dear guide who more than seven times
    hast rendered me security and drawn me
    from imminent peril that before me stood

do not desert me said i thus undone
    and if the going farther be denied us
    let us retrace our steps together swiftly

and that lord who had led me thitherward
    said unto me fear not because our passage
    none can take from us it by such is given

but here await me and thy weary spirit
    comfort and nourish with a better hope
    for in this nether world i will not leave thee

so onward goes and there abandons me
    my father sweet and i remain in doubt
    for no and yes within my head contend

i could not hear what he proposed to them
    but with them there he did not linger long
    ere each within in rivalry ran back

they closed the portals those our adversaries
    on my lords breast who had remained without
    and turned to me with footsteps far between

his eyes cast down his forehead shorn had he
    of all its boldness and he said with sighs
    who has denied to me the dolesome houses

and unto me thou because i am angry
    fear not for i will conquer in the trial
    whatever for defence within be planned

this arrogance of theirs is nothing new
    for once they used it at less secret gate
    which finds itself without a fastening still

oer it didst thou behold the dead inscription
    and now this side of it descends the steep
    passing across the circles without escort

one by whose means the city shall be opened







that hue which cowardice brought out on me
    beholding my conductor backward turn
    sooner repressed within him his new colour

he stopped attentive like a man who listens
    because the eye could not conduct him far
    through the black air and through the heavy fog

still it behoveth us to win the fight
    began he else  such offered us herself  
    o how i long that some one here arrive

well i perceived as soon as the beginning
    he covered up with what came afterward
    that they were words quite different from the first

but none the less his saying gave me fear
    because i carried out the broken phrase
    perhaps to a worse meaning than he had

into this bottom of the doleful conch
    doth any eer descend from the first grade
    which for its pain has only hope cut off

this question put i and he answered me
    seldom it comes to pass that one of us
    maketh the journey upon which i go

true is it once before i here below
    was conjured by that pitiless erictho
    who summoned back the shades unto their bodies

naked of me short while the flesh had been
    before within that wall she made me enter
    to bring a spirit from the circle of judas

that is the lowest region and the darkest
    and farthest from the heaven which circles all
    well know i the way therefore be reassured

this fen which a prodigious stench exhales
    encompasses about the city dolent
    where now we cannot enter without anger

and more he said but not in mind i have it
    because mine eye had altogether drawn me
    towrds the high tower with the redflaming summit

where in a moment saw i swift uprisen
    the three infernal furies stained with blood
    who had the limbs of women and their mien

and with the greenest hydras were begirt
    small serpents and cerastes were their tresses
    wherewith their horrid temples were entwined

and he who well the handmaids of the queen
    of everlasting lamentation knew
    said unto me behold the fierce erinnys

this is megaera on the lefthand side
    she who is weeping on the right alecto
    tisiphone is between and then was silent

each one her breast was rending with her nails
    they beat them with their palms and cried so loud
    that i for dread pressed close unto the poet

medusa come so we to stone will change him
    all shouted looking down in evil hour
    avenged we not on theseus his assault

turn thyself round and keep thine eyes close shut
    for if the gorgon appear and thou shouldst see it
    no more returning upward would there be

thus said the master and he turned me round
    himself and trusted not unto my hands
    so far as not to blind me with his own

o ye who have undistempered intellects
    observe the doctrine that conceals itself
    beneath the veil of the mysterious verses

and now there came across the turbid waves
    the clangour of a sound with terror fraught
    because of which both of the margins trembled

not otherwise it was than of a wind
    impetuous on account of adverse heats
    that smites the forest and without restraint

the branches rends beats down and bears away
    right onward laden with dust it goes superb
    and puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds

mine eyes he loosed and said direct the nerve
    of vision now along that ancient foam
    there yonder where that smoke is most intense

even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
    across the water scatter all abroad
    until each one is huddled in the earth

more than a thousand ruined souls i saw
    thus fleeing from before one who on foot
    was passing oer the styx with soles unwet

from off his face he fanned that unctuous air
    waving his left hand oft in front of him
    and only with that anguish seemed he weary

well i perceived one sent from heaven was he
    and to the master turned and he made sign
    that i should quiet stand and bow before him

ah how disdainful he appeared to me
    he reached the gate and with a little rod
    he opened it for there was no resistance

o banished out of heaven people despised
    thus he began upon the horrid threshold
    whence is this arrogance within you couched

wherefore recalcitrate against that will
    from which the end can never be cut off
    and which has many times increased your pain

what helpeth it to butt against the fates
    your cerberus if you remember well
    for that still bears his chin and gullet peeled

then he returned along the miry road
    and spake no word to us but had the look
    of one whom other care constrains and goads

than that of him who in his presence is
    and we our feet directed towrds the city
    after those holy words all confident

within we entered without any contest
    and i who inclination had to see
    what the condition such a fortress holds

soon as i was within cast round mine eye
    and see on every hand an ample plain
    full of distress and torment terrible

even as at arles where stagnant grows the rhone
    even as at pola near to the quarnaro
    that shuts in italy and bathes its borders

the sepulchres make all the place uneven
    so likewise did they there on every side
    saving that there the manner was more bitter

for flames between the sepulchres were scattered
    by which they so intensely heated were
    that iron more so asks not any art

all of their coverings uplifted were
    and from them issued forth such dire laments
    sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented

and i my master what are all those people
    who having sepulture within those tombs
    make themselves audible by doleful sighs

and he to me here are the heresiarchs
    with their disciples of all sects and much
    more than thou thinkest laden are the tombs

here like together with its like is buried
    and more and less the monuments are heated
    and when he to the right had turned we passed

between the torments and high parapets






now onward goes along a narrow path
    between the torments and the city wall
    my master and i follow at his back

o power supreme that through these impious circles
    turnest me i began as pleases thee
    speak to me and my longings satisfy

the people who are lying in these tombs
    might they be seen already are uplifted
    the covers all and no one keepeth guard

and he to me they all will be closed up
    when from jehoshaphat they shall return
    here with the bodies they have left above

their cemetery have upon this side
    with epicurus all his followers
    who with the body mortal make the soul

but in the question thou dost put to me
    within here shalt thou soon be satisfied
    and likewise in the wish thou keepest silent

and i good leader i but keep concealed
    from thee my heart that i may speak the less
    nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me

o tuscan thou who through the city of fire
    goest alive thus speaking modestly
    be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place

thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
    a native of that noble fatherland
    to which perhaps i too molestful was

upon a sudden issued forth this sound
    from out one of the tombs wherefore i pressed
    fearing a little nearer to my leader

and unto me he said turn thee what dost thou
    behold there farinata who has risen
    from the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him

i had already fixed mine eyes on his
    and he uprose erect with breast and front
    een as if hell he had in great despite

and with courageous hands and prompt my leader
    thrust me between the sepulchres towards him
    exclaiming let thy words explicit be

as soon as i was at the foot of his tomb
    somewhat he eyed me and as if disdainful
    then asked of me who were thine ancestors

i who desirous of obeying was
    concealed it not but all revealed to him
    whereat he raised his brows a little upward

then said he fiercely adverse have they been
    to me and to my fathers and my party
    so that two several times i scattered them

if they were banished they returned on all sides
    i answered him the first time and the second
    but yours have not acquired that art aright

then there uprose upon the sight uncovered
    down to the chin a shadow at his side
    i think that he had risen on his knees

round me he gazed as if solicitude
    he had to see if some one else were with me
    but after his suspicion was all spent

weeping he said to me if through this blind
    prison thou goest by loftiness of genius
    where is my son and why is he not with thee

and i to him i come not of myself
    he who is waiting yonder leads me here
    whom in disdain perhaps your guido had

his language and the mode of punishment
    already unto me had read his name
    on that account my answer was so full

up starting suddenly he cried out how
    saidst thouhe had  is he not still alive
    does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes

when he became aware of some delay
    which i before my answer made supine
    he fell again and forth appeared no more

but the other magnanimous at whose desire
    i had remained did not his aspect change
    neither his neck he moved nor bent his side

and if continuing his first discourse
    they have that art he said not learned aright
    that more tormenteth me than doth this bed

but fifty times shall not rekindled be
    the countenance of the lady who reigns here
    ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art

and as thou wouldst to the sweet world return
    say why that people is so pitiless
    against my race in each one of its laws

whence i to him the slaughter and great carnage
    which have with crimson stained the arbia cause
    such orisons in our temple to be made

after his head he with a sigh had shaken
    there i was not alone he said nor surely
    without a cause had with the others moved

but there i was alone where every one
    consented to the laying waste of florence
    he who defended her with open face

ah so hereafter may your seed repose
    i him entreated solve for me that knot
    which has entangled my conceptions here

it seems that you can see if i hear rightly
    beforehand whatsoeer time brings with it
    and in the present have another mode

we see like those who have imperfect sight
    the things he said that distant are from us
    so much still shines on us the sovereign ruler

when they draw near or are is wholly vain
    our intellect and if none brings it to us
    not anything know we of your human state

hence thou canst understand that wholly dead
    will be our knowledge from the moment when
    the portal of the future shall be closed

then i as if compunctious for my fault
    said now then you will tell that fallen one
    that still his son is with the living joined

and if just now in answering i was dumb
    tell him i did it because i was thinking
    already of the error you have solved me

and now my master was recalling me
    wherefore more eagerly i prayed the spirit
    that he would tell me who was with him there

he said with more than a thousand here i lie
    within here is the second frederick
    and the cardinal and of the rest i speak not

thereon he hid himself and i towards
    the ancient poet turned my steps reflecting
    upon that saying which seemed hostile to me

he moved along and afterward thus going
    he said to me why art thou so bewildered
    and i in his inquiry satisfied him

let memory preserve what thou hast heard
    against thyself that sage commanded me
    and now attend here and he raised his finger

when thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
    of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold
    from her thoult know the journey of thy life

unto the left hand then he turned his feet
    we left the wall and went towards the middle
    along a path that strikes into a valley

which even up there unpleasant made its stench







upon the margin of a lofty bank
    which great rocks broken in a circle made
    we came upon a still more cruel throng

and there by reason of the horrible
    excess of stench the deep abyss throws out
    we drew ourselves aside behind the cover

of a great tomb whereon i saw a writing
    which said pope anastasius i hold
    whom out of the right way photinus drew

slow it behoveth our descent to be
    so that the sense be first a little used
    to the sad blast and then we shall not heed it

the master thus and unto him i said
    some compensation find that the time pass not
    idly and he thou seest i think of that

my son upon the inside of these rocks
    began he then to say are three small circles
    from grade to grade like those which thou art leaving

they all are full of spirits maledict
    but that hereafter sight alone suffice thee
    hear how and wherefore they are in constraint

of every malice that wins hate in heaven
    injury is the end and all such end
    either by force or fraud afflicteth others

but because fraud is mans peculiar vice
    more it displeases god and so stand lowest
    the fraudulent and greater dole assails them

all the first circle of the violent is
    but since force may be used against three persons
    in three rounds tis divided and constructed

to god to ourselves and to our neighbour can we
    use force i say on them and on their things
    as thou shalt hear with reason manifest

a death by violence and painful wounds
    are to our neighbour given and in his substance
    ruin and arson and injurious levies

whence homicides and he who smites unjustly
    marauders and freebooters the first round
    tormenteth all in companies diverse

man may lay violent hands upon himself
    and his own goods and therefore in the second
    round must perforce without avail repent

whoever of your world deprives himself
    who games and dissipates his property
    and weepeth there where he should jocund be

violence can be done the deity
    in heart denying and blaspheming him
    and by disdaining nature and her bounty

and for this reason doth the smallest round
    seal with its signet sodom and cahors
    and who disdaining god speaks from the heart

fraud wherewithal is every conscience stung
    a man may practise upon him who trusts
    and him who doth no confidence imburse

this latter mode it would appear dissevers
    only the bond of love which nature makes
    wherefore within the second circle nestle

hypocrisy flattery and who deals in magic
    falsification theft and simony
    panders and barrators and the like filth

by the other mode forgotten is that love
    which nature makes and what is after added
    from which there is a special faith engendered

hence in the smallest circle where the point is
    of the universe upon which dis is seated
    whoeer betrays for ever is consumed

and i my master clear enough proceeds
    thy reasoning and full well distinguishes
    this cavern and the people who possess it

but tell me those within the fat lagoon
    whom the wind drives and whom the rain doth beat
    and who encounter with such bitter tongues

wherefore are they inside of the red city
    not punished if god has them in his wrath
    and if he has not wherefore in such fashion

and unto me he said why wanders so
    thine intellect from that which it is wont
    or sooth thy mind where is it elsewhere looking

hast thou no recollection of those words
    with which thine ethics thoroughly discusses
    the dispositions three that heaven abides not

incontinence and malice and insane
    bestiality and how incontinence
    less god offendeth and less blame attracts

if thou regardest this conclusion well
    and to thy mind recallest who they are
    that up outside are undergoing penance

clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
    they separated are and why less wroth
    justice divine doth smite them with its hammer

o sun that healest all distempered vision
    thou dost content me so when thou resolvest
    that doubting pleases me no less than knowing

once more a little backward turn thee said i
    there where thou sayest that usury offends
    goodness divine and disengage the knot

philosophy he said to him who heeds it
    noteth not only in one place alone
    after what manner nature takes her course

from intellect divine and from its art
    and if thy physics carefully thou notest
    after not many pages shalt thou find

that this your art as far as possible
    follows as the disciple doth the master
    so that your art is as it were gods grandchild

from these two if thou bringest to thy mind
    genesis at the beginning it behoves
    mankind to gain their life and to advance

and since the usurer takes another way
    nature herself and in her follower
    disdains he for elsewhere he puts his hope

but follow now as i would fain go on
    for quivering are the fishes on the horizon
    and the wain wholly over caurus lies

and far beyond there we descend the crag







the place where to descend the bank we came
    was alpine and from what was there moreover
    of such a kind that every eye would shun it

such as that ruin is which in the flank
    smote on this side of trent the adige
    either by earthquake or by failing stay

for from the mountains top from which it moved
    unto the plain the cliff is shattered so
    some path twould give to him who was above

even such was the descent of that ravine
    and on the border of the broken chasm
    the infamy of crete was stretched along

who was conceived in the fictitious cow
    and when he us beheld he bit himself
    even as one whom anger racks within

my sage towards him shouted peradventure
    thou thinkst that here may be the duke of athens
    who in the world above brought death to thee

get thee gone beast for this one cometh not
    instructed by thy sister but he comes
    in order to behold your punishments

as is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
    in which he has received the mortal blow
    who cannot walk but staggers here and there

the minotaur beheld i do the like
    and he the wary cried run to the passage
    while he wroth tis well thou shouldst descend

thus down we took our way oer that discharge
    of stones which oftentimes did move themselves
    beneath my feet from the unwonted burden

thoughtful i went and he said thou art thinking
    perhaps upon this ruin which is guarded
    by that brute anger which just now i quenched

now will i have thee know the other time
    i here descended to the nether hell
    this precipice had not yet fallen down

but truly if i well discern a little
    before his coming who the mighty spoil
    bore off from dis in the supernal circle

upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
    trembled so that i thought the universe
    was thrilled with love by which there are who think

the world ofttimes converted into chaos
    and at that moment this primeval crag
    both here and elsewhere made such overthrow

but fix thine eyes below for draweth near
    the river of blood within which boiling is
    whoeer by violence doth injure others

o blind cupidity o wrath insane
    that spurs us onward so in our short life
    and in the eternal then so badly steeps us

i saw an ample moat bent like a bow
    as one which all the plain encompasses
    conformable to what my guide had said

and between this and the embankments foot
    centaurs in file were running armed with arrows
    as in the world they used the chase to follow

beholding us descend each one stood still
    and from the squadron three detached themselves
    with bows and arrows in advance selected

and from afar one cried unto what torment
    come ye who down the hillside are descending
    tell us from there if not i draw the bow

my master said our answer will we make
    to chiron near you there in evil hour
    that will of thine was evermore so hasty

then touched he me and said this one is nessus
    who perished for the lovely dejanira
    and for himself himself did vengeance take

and he in the midst who at his breast is gazing
    is the great chiron who brought up achilles
    that other pholus is who was so wrathful

thousands and thousands go about the moat
    shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
    out of the blood more than his crime allots

near we approached unto those monsters fleet
    chiron an arrow took and with the notch
    backward upon his jaws he put his beard

after he had uncovered his great mouth
    he said to his companions are you ware
    that he behind moveth whateer he touches

thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men
    and my good guide who now was at his breast
    where the two natures are together joined

replied indeed he lives and thus alone
    me it behoves to show him the dark valley
    necessity and not delight impels us

some one withdrew from singing halleluja
    who unto me committed this new office
    no thief is he nor i a thievish spirit

but by that virtue through which i am moving
    my steps along this savage thoroughfare
    give us some one of thine to be with us

and who may show us where to pass the ford
    and who may carry this one on his back
    for tis no spirit that can walk the air

upon his right breast chiron wheeled about
    and said to nessus turn and do thou guide them
    and warn aside if other band may meet you

we with our faithful escort onward moved
    along the brink of the vermilion boiling
    wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments

people i saw within up to the eyebrows
    and the great centaur said tyrants are these
    who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging

here they lament their pitiless mischiefs here
    is alexander and fierce dionysius
    who upon sicily brought dolorous years

that forehead there which has the hair so black
    is azzolin and the other who is blond
    obizzo is of esti who in truth

up in the world was by his stepson slain
    then turned i to the poet and he said
    now he be first to thee and second i

a little farther on the centaur stopped
    above a folk who far down as the throat
    seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth

a shade he showed us on one side alone
    saying he cleft asunder in gods bosom
    the heart that still upon the thames is honoured

then people saw i who from out the river
    lifted their heads and also all the chest
    and many among these i recognised

thus ever more and more grew shallower
    that blood so that the feet alone it covered
    and there across the moat our passage was

even as thou here upon this side beholdest
    the boiling stream that aye diminishes
    the centaur said i wish thee to believe

that on this other more and more declines
    its bed until it reunites itself
    where it behoveth tyranny to groan

justice divine upon this side is goading
    that attila who was a scourge on earth
    and pyrrhus and sextus and for ever milks

the tears which with the boiling it unseals
    in rinier da corneto and rinier pazzo
    who made upon the highways so much war

then back he turned and passed again the ford







not yet had nessus reached the other side
    when we had put ourselves within a wood
    that was not marked by any path whatever

not foliage green but of a dusky colour
    not branches smooth but gnarled and intertangled
    not appletrees were there but thorns with poison

such tangled thickets have not nor so dense
    those savage wild beasts that in hatred hold
    twixt cecina and corneto the tilled places

there do the hideous harpies make their nests
    who chased the trojans from the strophades
    with sad announcement of impending doom

broad wings have they and necks and faces human
    and feet with claws and their great bellies fledged
    they make laments upon the wondrous trees

and the good master ere thou enter farther
    know that thou art within the second round
    thus he began to say and shalt be till

thou comest out upon the horrible sand
    therefore look well around and thou shalt see
    things that will credence give unto my speech

i heard on all sides lamentations uttered
    and person none beheld i who might make them
    whence utterly bewildered i stood still

i think he thought that i perhaps might think
    so many voices issued through those trunks
    from people who concealed themselves from us

therefore the master said if thou break off
    some little spray from any of these trees
    the thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain

then stretched i forth my hand a little forward
    and plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn
    and the trunk cried why dost thou mangle me

after it had become embrowned with blood
    it recommenced its cry why dost thou rend me
    hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever

men once we were and now are changed to trees
    indeed thy hand should be more pitiful
    even if the souls of serpents we had been

as out of a green brand that is on fire
    at one of the ends and from the other drips
    and hisses with the wind that is escaping

so from that splinter issued forth together
    both words and blood whereat i let the tip
    fall and stood like a man who is afraid

had he been able sooner to believe
    my sage made answer o thou wounded soul
    what only in my verses he has seen

not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand
    whereas the thing incredible has caused me
    to put him to an act which grieveth me

but tell him who thou wast so that by way
    of some amends thy fame he may refresh
    up in the world to which he can return

and the trunk said so thy sweet words allure me
    i cannot silent be and you be vexed not
    that i a little to discourse am tempted

i am the one who both keys had in keeping
    of fredericks heart and turned them to and fro
    so softly in unlocking and in locking

that from his secrets most men i withheld
    fidelity i bore the glorious office
    so great i lost thereby my sleep and pulses

the courtesan who never from the dwelling
    of caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes
    death universal and the vice of courts

inflamed against me all the other minds
    and they inflamed did so inflame augustus
    that my glad honours turned to dismal mournings

my spirit in disdainful exultation
    thinking by dying to escape disdain
    made me unjust against myself the just

i by the roots unwonted of this wood
    do swear to you that never broke i faith
    unto my lord who was so worthy of honour

and to the world if one of you return
    let him my memory comfort which is lying
    still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it

waited awhile and then since he is silent
    the poet said to me lose not the time
    but speak and question him if more may please thee

whence i to him do thou again inquire
    concerning what thou thinkst will satisfy me
    for i cannot such pity is in my heart

therefore he recommenced so may the man
    do for thee freely what thy speech implores
    spirit incarcerate again be pleased

to tell us in what way the soul is bound
    within these knots and tell us if thou canst
    if any from such members eer is freed

then blew the trunk amain and afterward
    the wind was into such a voice converted
    with brevity shall be replied to you

when the exasperated soul abandons
    the body whence it rent itself away
    minos consigns it to the seventh abyss

it falls into the forest and no part
    is chosen for it but where fortune hurls it
    there like a grain of spelt it germinates

it springs a sapling and a forest tree
    the harpies feeding then upon its leaves
    do pain create and for the pain an outlet

like others for our spoils shall we return
    but not that any one may them revest
    for tis not just to have what one casts off

here we shall drag them and along the dismal
    forest our bodies shall suspended be
    each to the thorn of his molested shade

we were attentive still unto the trunk
    thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us
    when by a tumult we were overtaken

in the same way as he is who perceives
    the boar and chase approaching to his stand
    who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches

and two behold upon our lefthand side
    naked and scratched fleeing so furiously
    that of the forest every fan they broke

he who was in advance now help death help
    and the other one who seemed to lag too much
    was shouting lano were not so alert

those legs of thine at joustings of the toppo
    and then perchance because his breath was failing
    he grouped himself together with a bush

behind them was the forest full of black
    shemastiffs ravenous and swift of foot
    as greyhounds who are issuing from the chain

on him who had crouched down they set their teeth
    and him they lacerated piece by piece
    thereafter bore away those aching members

thereat my escort took me by the hand
    and led me to the bush that all in vain
    was weeping from its bloody lacerations

o jacopo it said of sant andrea
    what helped it thee of me to make a screen
    what blame have i in thy nefarious life

when near him had the master stayed his steps
    he said who wast thou that through wounds so many
    art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech

and he to us o souls that hither come
    to look upon the shameful massacre
    that has so rent away from me my leaves

gather them up beneath the dismal bush
    i of that city was which to the baptist
    changed its first patron wherefore he for this

forever with his art will make it sad
    and were it not that on the pass of arno
    some glimpses of him are remaining still

those citizens who afterwards rebuilt it
    upon the ashes left by attila
    in vain had caused their labour to be done

of my own house i made myself a gibbet







because the charity of my native place
    constrained me gathered i the scattered leaves
    and gave them back to him who now was hoarse

then came we to the confine where disparted
    the second round is from the third and where
    a horrible form of justice is beheld

clearly to manifest these novel things
    i say that we arrived upon a plain
    which from its bed rejecteth every plant

the dolorous forest is a garland to it
    all round about as the sad moat to that
    there close upon the edge we stayed our feet

the soil was of an arid and thick sand
    not of another fashion made than that
    which by the feet of cato once was pressed

vengeance of god o how much oughtest thou
    by each one to be dreaded who doth read
    that which was manifest unto mine eyes

of naked souls beheld i many herds
    who all were weeping very miserably
    and over them seemed set a law diverse

supine upon the ground some folk were lying
    and some were sitting all drawn up together
    and others went about continually

those who were going round were far the more
    and those were less who lay down to their torment
    but had their tongues more loosed to lamentation

oer all the sandwaste with a gradual fall
    were raining down dilated flakes of fire
    as of the snow on alp without a wind

as alexander in those torrid parts
    of india beheld upon his host
    flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground

whence he provided with his phalanxes
    to trample down the soil because the vapour
    better extinguished was while it was single

thus was descending the eternal heat
    whereby the sand was set on fire like tinder
    beneath the steel for doubling of the dole

without repose forever was the dance
    of miserable hands now there now here
    shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds

master began i thou who overcomest
    all things except the demons dire that issued
    against us at the entrance of the gate

who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
    the fire and lieth lowering and disdainful
    so that the rain seems not to ripen him

and he himself who had become aware
    that i was questioning my guide about him
    cried such as i was living am i dead

if jove should weary out his smith from whom
    he seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt
    wherewith upon the last day i was smitten

and if he wearied out by turns the others
    in mongibello at the swarthy forge
    vociferating help good vulcan help

even as he did there at the fight of phlegra
    and shot his bolts at me with all his might
    he would not have thereby a joyous vengeance

then did my leader speak with such great force
    that i had never heard him speak so loud
    o capaneus in that is not extinguished

thine arrogance thou punished art the more
    not any torment saving thine own rage
    would be unto thy fury pain complete

then he turned round to me with better lip
    saying one of the seven kings was he
    who thebes besieged and held and seems to hold

god in disdain and little seems to prize him
    but as i said to him his own despites
    are for his breast the fittest ornaments

now follow me and mind thou do not place
    as yet thy feet upon the burning sand
    but always keep them close unto the wood

speaking no word we came to where there gushes
    forth from the wood a little rivulet
    whose redness makes my hair still stand on end

as from the bulicame springs the brooklet
    the sinful women later share among them
    so downward through the sand it went its way

the bottom of it and both sloping banks
    were made of stone and the margins at the side
    whence i perceived that there the passage was

in all the rest which i have shown to thee
    since we have entered in within the gate
    whose threshold unto no one is denied

nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
    so notable as is the present river
    which all the little flames above it quenches

these words were of my leader whence i prayed him
    that he would give me largess of the food
    for which he had given me largess of desire

in the midsea there sits a wasted land
    said he thereafterward whose name is crete
    under whose king the world of old was chaste

there is a mountain there that once was glad
    with waters and with leaves which was called ida
    now tis deserted as a thing worn out

rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
    of her own son and to conceal him better
    wheneer he cried she there had clamours made

a grand old man stands in the mount erect
    who holds his shoulders turned towrds damietta
    and looks at rome as if it were his mirror

his head is fashioned of refined gold
    and of pure silver are the arms and breast
    then he is brass as far down as the fork

from that point downward all is chosen iron
    save that the right foot is of kilnbaked clay
    and more he stands on that than on the other

each part except the gold is by a fissure
    asunder cleft that dripping is with tears
    which gathered together perforate that cavern

from rock to rock they fall into this valley
    acheron styx and phlegethon they form
    then downward go along this narrow sluice

unto that point where is no more descending
    they form cocytus what that pool may be
    thou shalt behold so here tis not narrated

and i to him if so the present runnel
    doth take its rise in this way from our world
    why only on this verge appears it to us

and he to me thou knowest the place is round
    and notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far
    still to the left descending to the bottom

thou hast not yet through all the circle turned
    therefore if something new appear to us
    it should not bring amazement to thy face

and i again master where shall be found
    lethe and phlegethon for of one thourt silent
    and sayest the other of this rain is made

in all thy questions truly thou dost please me
    replied he but the boiling of the red
    water might well solve one of them thou makest

thou shalt see lethe but outside this moat
    there where the souls repair to lave themselves
    when sin repented of has been removed

then said he it is time now to abandon
    the wood take heed that thou come after me
    a way the margins make that are not burning

and over them all vapours are extinguished







now bears us onward one of the hard margins
    and so the brooklets mist oershadows it
    from fire it saves the water and the dikes

even as the flemings twixt cadsand and bruges
    fearing the flood that towrds them hurls itself
    their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight

and as the paduans along the brenta
    to guard their villas and their villages
    or ever chiarentana feel the heat

in such similitude had those been made
    albeit not so lofty nor so thick
    whoever he might be the master made them

now were we from the forest so remote
    i could not have discovered where it was
    even if backward i had turned myself

when we a company of souls encountered
    who came beside the dike and every one
    gazed at us as at evening we are wont

to eye each other under a new moon
    and so towards us sharpened they their brows
    as an old tailor at the needles eye

thus scrutinised by such a family
    by some one i was recognised who seized
    my garments hem and cried out what a marvel

and i when he stretched forth his arm to me
    on his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes
    that the scorched countenance prevented not

his recognition by my intellect
    and bowing down my face unto his own
    i made reply are you here ser brunetto

and he mayt not displease thee o my son
    if a brief space with thee brunetto latini
    backward return and let the trail go on

i said to him with all my power i ask it
    and if you wish me to sit down with you
    i will if he please for i go with him

o son he said whoever of this herd
    a moment stops lies then a hundred years
    nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire

therefore go on i at thy skirts will come
    and afterward will i rejoin my band
    which goes lamenting its eternal doom

i did not dare to go down from the road
    level to walk with him but my head bowed
    i held as one who goeth reverently

and he began what fortune or what fate
    before the last day leadeth thee down here
    and who is this that showeth thee the way

up there above us in the life serene
    i answered him i lost me in a valley
    or ever yet my age had been completed

but yestermorn i turned my back upon it
    this one appeared to me returning thither
    and homeward leadeth me along this road

and he to me if thou thy star do follow
    thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port
    if well i judged in the life beautiful

and if i had not died so prematurely
    seeing heaven thus benignant unto thee
    i would have given thee comfort in the work

but that ungrateful and malignant people
    which of old time from fesole descended
    and smacks still of the mountain and the granite

will make itself for thy good deeds thy foe
    and it is right for among crabbed sorbs
    it ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit

old rumour in the world proclaims them blind
    a people avaricious envious proud
    take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee

thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee
    one party and the other shall be hungry
    for thee but far from goat shall be the grass

their litter let the beasts of fesole
    make of themselves nor let them touch the plant
    if any still upon their dunghill rise

in which may yet revive the consecrated
    seed of those romans who remained there when
    the nest of such great malice it became

if my entreaty wholly were fulfilled
    replied i to him not yet would you be
    in banishment from human nature placed

for in my mind is fixed and touches now
    my heart the dear and good paternal image
    of you when in the world from hour to hour

you taught me how a man becomes eternal
    and how much i am grateful while i live
    behoves that in my language be discerned

what you narrate of my career i write
    and keep it to be glossed with other text
    by a lady who can do it if i reach her

this much will i have manifest to you
    provided that my conscience do not chide me
    for whatsoever fortune i am ready

such handsel is not new unto mine ears
    therefore let fortune turn her wheel around
    as it may please her and the churl his mattock

my master thereupon on his right cheek
    did backward turn himself and looked at me
    then said he listeneth well who noteth it

nor speaking less on that account i go
    with ser brunetto and i ask who are
    his most known and most eminent companions

and he to me to know of some is well
    of others it were laudable to be silent
    for short would be the time for so much speech

know them in sum that all of them were clerks
    and men of letters great and of great fame
    in the world tainted with the selfsame sin

priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd
    and francis of accorso and thou hadst seen there
    if thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf

that one who by the servant of the servants
    from arno was transferred to bacchiglione
    where he has left his sinexcited nerves

more would i say but coming and discoursing
    can be no longer for that i behold
    new smoke uprising yonder from the sand

a people comes with whom i may not be
    commended unto thee be my tesoro
    in which i still live and no more i ask

then he turned round and seemed to be of those
    who at verona run for the green mantle
    across the plain and seemed to be among them

the one who wins and not the one who loses






now was i where was heard the reverberation
    of water falling into the next round
    like to that humming which the beehives make

when shadows three together started forth
    running from out a company that passed
    beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom

towards us came they and each one cried out
    stop thou for by thy garb to us thou seemest
    to be some one of our depraved city

ah me what wounds i saw upon their limbs
    recent and ancient by the flames burnt in
    it pains me still but to remember it

unto their cries my teacher paused attentive
    he turned his face towards me and now wait
    he said to these we should be courteous

and if it were not for the fire that darts
    the nature of this region i should say
    that haste were more becoming thee than them

as soon as we stood still they recommenced
    the old refrain and when they overtook us
    formed of themselves a wheel all three of them

as champions stripped and oiled are wont to do
    watching for their advantage and their hold
    before they come to blows and thrusts between them

thus wheeling round did every one his visage
    direct to me so that in opposite wise
    his neck and feet continual journey made

and if the misery of this soft place
    bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties
    began one and our aspect black and blistered

let the renown of us thy mind incline
    to tell us who thou art who thus securely
    thy living feet dost move along through hell

he in whose footprints thou dost see me treading
    naked and skinless though he now may go
    was of a greater rank than thou dost think

he was the grandson of the good gualdrada
    his name was guidoguerra and in life
    much did he with his wisdom and his sword

the other who close by me treads the sand
    tegghiaio aldobrandi is whose fame
    above there in the world should welcome be

and i who with them on the cross am placed
    jacopo rusticucci was and truly
    my savage wife more than aught else doth harm me

could i have been protected from the fire
    below i should have thrown myself among them
    and think the teacher would have suffered it

but as i should have burned and baked myself
    my terror overmastered my good will
    which made me greedy of embracing them

then i began sorrow and not disdain
    did your condition fix within me so
    that tardily it wholly is stripped off

as soon as this my lord said unto me
    words on account of which i thought within me
    that people such as you are were approaching

i of your city am and evermore
    your labours and your honourable names
    i with affection have retraced and heard

i leave the gall and go for the sweet fruits
    promised to me by the veracious leader
    but to the centre first i needs must plunge

so may the soul for a long while conduct
    those limbs of thine did he make answer then
    and so may thy renown shine after thee

valour and courtesy say if they dwell
    within our city as they used to do
    or if they wholly have gone out of it

for guglielmo borsier who is in torment
    with us of late and goes there with his comrades
    doth greatly mortify us with his words

the new inhabitants and the sudden gains
    pride and extravagance have in thee engendered
    florence so that thou weepst thereat already

in this wise i exclaimed with face uplifted
    and the three taking that for my reply
    looked at each other as one looks at truth

if other times so little it doth cost thee
    replied they all to satisfy another
    happy art thou thus speaking at thy will

therefore if thou escape from these dark places
    and come to rebehold the beauteous stars
    when it shall pleasure thee to say i was

see that thou speak of us unto the people
    then they broke up the wheel and in their flight
    it seemed as if their agile legs were wings

not an amen could possibly be said
    so rapidly as they had disappeared
    wherefore the master deemed best to depart

i followed him and little had we gone
    before the sound of water was so near us
    that speaking we should hardly have been heard

even as that stream which holdeth its own course
    the first from monte veso towrds the east
    upon the lefthand slope of apennine

which is above called acquacheta ere
    it down descendeth into its low bed
    and at forli is vacant of that name

reverberates there above san benedetto
    from alps by falling at a single leap
    where for a thousand there were room enough

thus downward from a bank precipitate
    we found resounding that darktinted water
    so that it soon the ear would have offended

i had a cord around about me girt
    and therewithal i whilom had designed
    to take the panther with the painted skin

after i this had all from me unloosed
    as my conductor had commanded me
    i reached it to him gathered up and coiled

whereat he turned himself to the right side
    and at a little distance from the verge
    he cast it down into that deep abyss

it must needs be some novelty respond
    i said within myself to the new signal
    the master with his eye is following so

ah me how very cautious men should be
    with those who not alone behold the act
    but with their wisdom look into the thoughts

he said to me soon there will upward come
    what i await and what thy thought is dreaming
    must soon reveal itself unto thy sight

aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood
    a man should close his lips as far as may be
    because without his fault it causes shame

but here i cannot and reader by the notes
    of this my comedy to thee i swear
    so may they not be void of lasting favour

athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
    i saw a figure swimming upward come
    marvellous unto every steadfast heart

even as he returns who goeth down
    sometimes to clear an anchor which has grappled
    reef or aught else that in the sea is hidden

who upward stretches and draws in his feet







behold the monster with the pointed tail
    who cleaves the hills and breaketh walls and weapons
    behold him who infecteth all the world

thus unto me my guide began to say
    and beckoned him that he should come to shore
    near to the confine of the trodden marble

and that uncleanly image of deceit
    came up and thrust ashore its head and bust
    but on the border did not drag its tail

the face was as the face of a just man
    its semblance outwardly was so benign
    and of a serpent all the trunk beside

two paws it had hairy unto the armpits
    the back and breast and both the sides it had
    depicted oer with nooses and with shields

with colours more groundwork or broidery
    never in cloth did tartars make nor turks
    nor were such tissues by arachne laid

as sometimes wherries lie upon the shore
    that part are in the water part on land
    and as among the guzzling germans there

the beaver plants himself to wage his war
    so that vile monster lay upon the border
    which is of stone and shutteth in the sand

his tail was wholly quivering in the void
    contorting upwards the envenomed fork
    that in the guise of scorpion armed its point

the guide said now perforce must turn aside
    our way a little even to that beast
    malevolent that yonder coucheth him

we therefore on the right side descended
    and made ten steps upon the outer verge
    completely to avoid the sand and flame

and after we are come to him i see
    a little farther off upon the sand
    a people sitting near the hollow place

then said to me the master so that full
    experience of this round thou bear away
    now go and see what their condition is

there let thy conversation be concise
    till thou returnest i will speak with him
    that he concede to us his stalwart shoulders

thus farther still upon the outermost
    head of that seventh circle all alone
    i went where sat the melancholy folk

out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe
    this way that way they helped them with their hands
    now from the flames and now from the hot soil

not otherwise in summer do the dogs
    now with the foot now with the muzzle when
    by fleas or flies or gadflies they are bitten

when i had turned mine eyes upon the faces
    of some on whom the dolorous fire is falling
    not one of them i knew but i perceived

that from the neck of each there hung a pouch
    which certain colour had and certain blazon
    and thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding

and as i gazing round me come among them
    upon a yellow pouch i azure saw
    that had the face and posture of a lion

proceeding then the current of my sight
    another of them saw i red as blood
    display a goose more white than butter is

and one who with an azure sow and gravid
    emblazoned had his little pouch of white
    said unto me what dost thou in this moat

now get thee gone and since thourt still alive
    know that a neighbour of mine vitaliano
    will have his seat here on my lefthand side

a paduan am i with these florentines
    full many a time they thunder in mine ears
    exclaiming come the sovereign cavalier

he who shall bring the satchel with three goats
    then twisted he his mouth and forth he thrust
    his tongue like to an ox that licks its nose

and fearing lest my longer stay might vex
    him who had warned me not to tarry long
    backward i turned me from those weary souls

i found my guide who had already mounted
    upon the back of that wild animal
    and said to me now be both strong and bold

now we descend by stairways such as these
    mount thou in front for i will be midway
    so that the tail may have no power to harm thee

such as he is who has so near the ague
    of quartan that his nails are blue already
    and trembles all but looking at the shade

even such became i at those proffered words
    but shame in me his menaces produced
    which maketh servant strong before good master

i seated me upon those monstrous shoulders
    i wished to say and yet the voice came not
    as i believed take heed that thou embrace me

but he who other times had rescued me
    in other peril soon as i had mounted
    within his arms encircled and sustained me

and said now geryon bestir thyself
    the circles large and the descent be little
    think of the novel burden which thou hast

even as the little vessel shoves from shore
    backward still backward so he thence withdrew
    and when he wholly felt himself afloat

there where his breast had been he turned his tail
    and that extended like an eel he moved
    and with his paws drew to himself the air

a greater fear i do not think there was
    what time abandoned phaeton the reins
    whereby the heavens as still appears were scorched

nor when the wretched icarus his flanks
    felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax
    his father crying an ill way thou takest

than was my own when i perceived myself
    on all sides in the air and saw extinguished
    the sight of everything but of the monster

onward he goeth swimming slowly slowly
    wheels and descends but i perceive it only
    by wind upon my face and from below

i heard already on the right the whirlpool
    making a horrible crashing under us
    whence i thrust out my head with eyes cast downward

then was i still more fearful of the abyss
    because i fires beheld and heard laments
    whereat i trembling all the closer cling

i saw then for before i had not seen it
    the turning and descending by great horrors
    that were approaching upon divers sides

as falcon who has long been on the wing
    who without seeing either lure or bird
    maketh the falconer say ah me thou stoopest

descendeth weary whence he started swiftly
    thorough a hundred circles and alights
    far from his master sullen and disdainful

even thus did geryon place us on the bottom
    close to the bases of the roughhewn rock
    and being disencumbered of our persons

he sped away as arrow from the string







there is a place in hell called malebolge
    wholly of stone and of an iron colour
    as is the circle that around it turns

right in the middle of the field malign
    there yawns a well exceeding wide and deep
    of which its place the structure will recount

round then is that enclosure which remains
    between the well and foot of the high hard bank
    and has distinct in valleys ten its bottom

as where for the protection of the walls
    many and many moats surround the castles
    the part in which they are a figure forms

just such an image those presented there
    and as about such strongholds from their gates
    unto the outer bank are little bridges

so from the precipices base did crags
    project which intersected dikes and moats
    unto the well that truncates and collects them

within this place down shaken from the back
    of geryon we found us and the poet
    held to the left and i moved on behind

upon my right hand i beheld new anguish
    new torments and new wielders of the lash
    wherewith the foremost bolgia was replete

down at the bottom were the sinners naked
    this side the middle came they facing us
    beyond it with us but with greater steps

even as the romans for the mighty host
    the year of jubilee upon the bridge
    have chosen a mode to pass the people over

for all upon one side towards the castle
    their faces have and go unto st peters
    on the other side they go towards the mountain

this side and that along the livid stone
    beheld i horned demons with great scourges
    who cruelly were beating them behind

ah me how they did make them lift their legs
    at the first blows and sooth not any one
    the second waited for nor for the third

while i was going on mine eyes by one
    encountered were and straight i said already
    with sight of this one i am not unfed

therefore i stayed my feet to make him out
    and with me the sweet guide came to a stand
    and to my going somewhat back assented

and he the scourged one thought to hide himself
    lowering his face but little it availed him
    for said i thou that castest down thine eyes

if false are not the features which thou bearest
    thou art venedico caccianimico
    but what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces

and he to me unwillingly i tell it
    but forces me thine utterance distinct
    which makes me recollect the ancient world

i was the one who the fair ghisola
    induced to grant the wishes of the marquis
    howeer the shameless story may be told

not the sole bolognese am i who weeps here
    nay rather is this place so full of them
    that not so many tongues today are taught

twixt reno and savena to say sipa
    and if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof
    bring to thy mind our avaricious heart

while speaking in this manner with his scourge
    a demon smote him and said get thee gone
    pander there are no women here for coin

i joined myself again unto mine escort
    thereafterward with footsteps few we came
    to where a crag projected from the bank

this very easily did we ascend
    and turning to the right along its ridge
    from those eternal circles we departed

when we were there where it is hollowed out
    beneath to give a passage to the scourged
    the guide said wait and see that on thee strike

the vision of those others evilborn
    of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces
    because together with us they have gone

from the old bridge we looked upon the train
    which towrds us came upon the other border
    and which the scourges in like manner smite

and the good master without my inquiring
    said to me see that tall one who is coming
    and for his pain seems not to shed a tear

still what a royal aspect he retains
    that jason is who by his heart and cunning
    the colchians of the ram made destitute

he by the isle of lemnos passed along
    after the daring women pitiless
    had unto death devoted all their males

there with his tokens and with ornate words
    did he deceive hypsipyle the maiden
    who first herself had all the rest deceived

there did he leave her pregnant and forlorn
    such sin unto such punishment condemns him
    and also for medea is vengeance done

with him go those who in such wise deceive
    and this sufficient be of the first valley
    to know and those that in its jaws it holds

we were already where the narrow path
    crosses athwart the second dike and forms
    of that a buttress for another arch

thence we heard people who are making moan
    in the next bolgia snorting with their muzzles
    and with their palms beating upon themselves

the margins were incrusted with a mould
    by exhalation from below that sticks there
    and with the eyes and nostrils wages war

the bottom is so deep no place suffices
    to give us sight of it without ascending
    the archs back where most the crag impends

thither we came and thence down in the moat
    i saw a people smothered in a filth
    that out of human privies seemed to flow

and whilst below there with mine eye i search
    i saw one with his head so foul with ordure
    it was not clear if he were clerk or layman

he screamed to me wherefore art thou so eager
    to look at me more than the other foul ones
    and i to him because if i remember

i have already seen thee with dry hair
    and thourt alessio interminei of lucca
    therefore i eye thee more than all the others

and he thereon belabouring his pumpkin
    the flatteries have submerged me here below
    wherewith my tongue was never surfeited

then said to me the guide see that thou thrust
    thy visage somewhat farther in advance
    that with thine eyes thou well the face attain

of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab
    who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails
    and crouches now and now on foot is standing

thais the harlot is it who replied
    unto her paramour when he said have i
    great gratitude from theenay marvellous

and herewith let our sight be satisfied






o simon magus o forlorn disciples
    ye who the things of god which ought to be
    the brides of holiness rapaciously

for silver and for gold do prostitute
    now it behoves for you the trumpet sound
    because in this third bolgia ye abide

we had already on the following tomb
    ascended to that portion of the crag
    which oer the middle of the moat hangs plumb

wisdom supreme o how great art thou showest
    in heaven in earth and in the evil world
    and with what justice doth thy power distribute

i saw upon the sides and on the bottom
    the livid stone with perforations filled
    all of one size and every one was round

to me less ample seemed they not nor greater
    than those that in my beautiful saint john
    are fashioned for the place of the baptisers

and one of which not many years ago
    i broke for some one who was drowning in it
    be this a seal all men to undeceive

out of the mouth of each one there protruded
    the feet of a transgressor and the legs
    up to the calf the rest within remained

in all of them the soles were both on fire
    wherefore the joints so violently quivered
    they would have snapped asunder withes and bands

even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
    to move upon the outer surface only
    so likewise was it there from heel to point

master who is that one who writhes himself
    more than his other comrades quivering
    i said and whom a redder flame is sucking

and he to me if thou wilt have me bear thee
    down there along that bank which lowest lies
    from him thoult know his errors and himself

and i what pleases thee to me is pleasing
    thou art my lord and knowest that i depart not
    from thy desire and knowest what is not spoken

straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived
    we turned and on the lefthand side descended
    down to the bottom full of holes and narrow

and the good master yet from off his haunch
    deposed me not till to the hole he brought me
    of him who so lamented with his shanks

whoeer thou art that standest upside down
    o doleful soul implanted like a stake
    to say began i if thou canst speak out

i stood even as the friar who is confessing
    the false assassin who when he is fixed
    recalls him so that death may be delayed

and he cried out dost thou stand there already
    dost thou stand there already boniface
    by many years the record lied to me

art thou so early satiate with that wealth
    for which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
    the beautiful lady and then work her woe

such i became as people are who stand
    not comprehending what is answered them
    as if bemocked and know not how to answer

then said virgilius say to him straightway
    i am not he i am not he thou thinkest
    and i replied as was imposed on me

whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet
    then sighing with a voice of lamentation
    said to me then what wantest thou of me

if who i am thou carest so much to know
    that thou on that account hast crossed the bank
    know that i vested was with the great mantle

and truly was i son of the shebear
    so eager to advance the cubs that wealth
    above and here myself i pocketed

beneath my head the others are dragged down
    who have preceded me in simony
    flattened along the fissure of the rock

below there i shall likewise fall whenever
    that one shall come who i believed thou wast
    what time the sudden question i proposed

but longer i my feet already toast
    and here have been in this way upside down
    than he will planted stay with reddened feet

for after him shall come of fouler deed
    from towrds the west a pastor without law
    such as befits to cover him and me

new jason will he be of whom we read
    in maccabees and as his king was pliant
    so he who governs france shall be to this one

i do not know if i were here too bold
    that him i answered only in this metre
    i pray thee tell me now how great a treasure

our lord demanded of saint peter first
    before he put the keys into his keeping
    truly he nothing asked but follow me

nor peter nor the rest asked of matthias
    silver or gold when he by lot was chosen
    unto the place the guilty soul had lost

therefore stay here for thou art justly punished
    and keep safe guard oer the illgotten money
    which caused thee to be valiant against charles

and were it not that still forbids it me
    the reverence for the keys superlative
    thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life

i would make use of words more grievous still
    because your avarice afflicts the world
    trampling the good and lifting the depraved

the evangelist you pastors had in mind
    when she who sitteth upon many waters
    to fornicate with kings by him was seen

the same who with the seven heads was born
    and power and strength from the ten horns received
    so long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing

ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver
    and from the idolater how differ ye
    save that he one and ye a hundred worship

ah constantine of how much ill was mother
    not thy conversion but that marriage dower
    which the first wealthy father took from thee

and while i sang to him such notes as these
    either that anger or that conscience stung him
    he struggled violently with both his feet

i think in sooth that it my leader pleased
    with such contented lip he listened ever
    unto the sound of the true words expressed

therefore with both his arms he took me up
    and when he had me all upon his breast
    remounted by the way where he descended

nor did he tire to have me clasped to him
    but bore me to the summit of the arch
    which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage

there tenderly he laid his burden down
    tenderly on the crag uneven and steep
    that would have been hard passage for the goats

thence was unveiled to me another valley







of a new pain behoves me to make verses
    and give material to the twentieth canto
    of the first song which is of the submerged

i was already thoroughly disposed
    to peer down into the uncovered depth
    which bathed itself with tears of agony

and people saw i through the circular valley
    silent and weeping coming at the pace
    which in this world the litanies assume

as lower down my sight descended on them
    wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
    from chin to the beginning of the chest

for towrds the reins the countenance was turned
    and backward it behoved them to advance
    as to look forward had been taken from them

perchance indeed by violence of palsy
    some one has been thus wholly turned awry
    but i neer saw it nor believe it can be

as god may let thee reader gather fruit
    from this thy reading think now for thyself
    how i could ever keep my face unmoistened

when our own image near me i beheld
    distorted so the weeping of the eyes
    along the fissure bathed the hinder parts

truly i wept leaning upon a peak
    of the hard crag so that my escort said
    to me art thou too of the other fools

here pity lives when it is wholly dead
    who is a greater reprobate than he
    who feels compassion at the doom divine

lift up lift up thy head and see for whom
    opened the earth before the thebans eyes
    wherefore they all cried whither rushest thou

amphiaraus  why dost leave the war
    and downward ceased he not to fall amain
    as far as minos who lays hold on all

see he has made a bosom of his shoulders
    because he wished to see too far before him
    behind he looks and backward goes his way

behold tiresias who his semblance changed
    when from a male a female he became
    his members being all of them transformed

and afterwards was forced to strike once more
    the two entangled serpents with his rod
    ere he could have again his manly plumes

that aruns is who backs the others belly
    who in the hills of luni there where grubs
    the carrarese who houses underneath

among the marbles white a cavern had
    for his abode whence to behold the stars
    and sea the view was not cut off from him

and she there who is covering up her breasts
    which thou beholdest not with loosened tresses
    and on that side has all the hairy skin

was manto who made quest through many lands
    afterwards tarried there where i was born
    whereof i would thou list to me a little

after her father had from life departed
    and the city of bacchus had become enslaved
    she a long season wandered through the world

above in beauteous italy lies a lake
    at the alps foot that shuts in germany
    over tyrol and has the name benaco

by a thousand springs i think and more is bathed
    twixt garda and val camonica pennino
    with water that grows stagnant in that lake

midway a place is where the trentine pastor
    and he of brescia and the veronese
    might give his blessing if he passed that way

sitteth peschiera fortress fair and strong
    to front the brescians and the bergamasks
    where round about the bank descendeth lowest

there of necessity must fall whatever
    in bosom of benaco cannot stay
    and grows a river down through verdant pastures

soon as the water doth begin to run
    no more benaco is it called but mincio
    far as governo where it falls in po

not far it runs before it finds a plain
    in which it spreads itself and makes it marshy
    and oft tis wont in summer to be sickly

passing that way the virgin pitiless
    land in the middle of the fen descried
    untilled and naked of inhabitants

there to escape all human intercourse
    she with her servants stayed her arts to practise
    and lived and left her empty body there

the men thereafter who were scattered round
    collected in that place which was made strong
    by the lagoon it had on every side

they built their city over those dead bones
    and after her who first the place selected
    mantua named it without other omen

its people once within more crowded were
    ere the stupidity of casalodi
    from pinamonte had received deceit

therefore i caution thee if eer thou hearest
    originate my city otherwise
    no falsehood may the verity defraud

and i my master thy discourses are
    to me so certain and so take my faith
    that unto me the rest would be spent coals

but tell me of the people who are passing
    if any one noteworthy thou beholdest
    for only unto that my mind reverts

then said he to me he who from the cheek
    thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
    was at the time when greece was void of males

so that there scarce remained one in the cradle
    an augur and with calchas gave the moment
    in aulis when to sever the first cable

eryphylus his name was and so sings
    my lofty tragedy in some part or other
    that knowest thou well who knowest the whole of it

the next who is so slender in the flanks
    was michael scott who of a verity
    of magical illusions knew the game

behold guido bonatti behold asdente
    who now unto his leather and his thread
    would fain have stuck but he too late repents

behold the wretched ones who left the needle
    the spool and rock and made them fortunetellers
    they wrought their magic spells with herb and image

but come now for already holds the confines
    of both the hemispheres and under seville
    touches the oceanwave cain and the thorns

and yesternight the moon was round already
    thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
    from time to time within the forest deep

thus spake he to me and we walked the while







from bridge to bridge thus speaking other things
    of which my comedy cares not to sing
    we came along and held the summit when

we halted to behold another fissure
    of malebolge and other vain laments
    and i beheld it marvellously dark

as in the arsenal of the venetians
    boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
    to smear their unsound vessels oer again

for sail they cannot and instead thereof
    one makes his vessel new and one recaulks
    the ribs of that which many a voyage has made

one hammers at the prow one at the stern
    this one makes oars and that one cordage twists
    another mends the mainsail and the mizzen

thus not by fire but by the art divine
    was boiling down below there a dense pitch
    which upon every side the bank belimed

i saw it but i did not see within it
    aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised
    and all swell up and resubside compressed

the while below there fixedly i gazed
    my leader crying out beware beware
    drew me unto himself from where i stood

then i turned round as one who is impatient
    to see what it behoves him to escape
    and whom a sudden terror doth unman

who while he looks delays not his departure
    and i beheld behind us a black devil
    running along upon the crag approach

ah how ferocious was he in his aspect
    and how he seemed to me in action ruthless
    with open wings and light upon his feet

his shoulders which sharppointed were and high
    a sinner did encumber with both haunches
    and he held clutched the sinews of the feet

from off our bridge he said o malebranche
    behold one of the elders of saint zita
    plunge him beneath for i return for others

unto that town which is well furnished with them
    all there are barrators except bonturo
    no into yes for money there is changed

he hurled him down and over the hard crag
    turned round and never was a mastiff loosened
    in so much hurry to pursue a thief

the other sank and rose again face downward
    but the demons under cover of the bridge
    cried here the santo volto has no place

here swims one otherwise than in the serchio
    therefore if for our gaffs thou wishest not
    do not uplift thyself above the pitch

they seized him then with more than a hundred rakes
    they said it here behoves thee to dance covered
    that if thou canst thou secretly mayest pilfer

not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
    immerse into the middle of the caldron
    the meat with hooks so that it may not float

said the good master to me that it be not
    apparent thou art here crouch thyself down
    behind a jag that thou mayest have some screen

and for no outrage that is done to me
    be thou afraid because these things i know
    for once before was i in such a scuffle

then he passed on beyond the bridges head
    and as upon the sixth bank he arrived
    need was for him to have a steadfast front

with the same fury and the same uproar
    as dogs leap out upon a mendicant
    who on a sudden begs whereer he stops

they issued from beneath the little bridge
    and turned against him all their grapplingirons
    but he cried out be none of you malignant

before those hooks of yours lay hold of me
    let one of you step forward who may hear me
    and then take counsel as to grappling me

they all cried out let malacoda go
    whereat one started and the rest stood still
    and he came to him saying what avails it

thinkest thou malacoda to behold me
    advanced into this place my master said
    safe hitherto from all your skill of fence

without the will divine and fate auspicious
    let me go on for it in heaven is willed
    that i another show this savage road

then was his arrogance so humbled in him
    that he let fall his grapnel at his feet
    and to the others said now strike him not

and unto me my guide o thou who sittest
    among the splinters of the bridge crouched down
    securely now return to me again

wherefore i started and came swiftly to him
    and all the devils forward thrust themselves
    so that i feared they would not keep their compact

and thus beheld i once afraid the soldiers
    who issued under safeguard from caprona
    seeing themselves among so many foes

close did i press myself with all my person
    beside my leader and turned not mine eyes
    from off their countenance which was not good

they lowered their rakes and wilt thou have me hit him
    they said to one another on the rump
    and answered yes see that thou nick him with it

but the same demon who was holding parley
    with my conductor turned him very quickly
    and said be quiet be quiet scarmiglione

then said to us you can no farther go
    forward upon this crag because is lying
    all shattered at the bottom the sixth arch

and if it still doth please you to go onward
    pursue your way along upon this rock
    near is another crag that yields a path

yesterday five hours later than this hour
    one thousand and two hundred sixtysix
    years were complete that here the way was broken

i send in that direction some of mine
    to see if any one doth air himself
    go ye with them for they will not be vicious

step forward alichino and calcabrina
    began he to cry out and thou cagnazzo
    and barbariccia do thou guide the ten

come forward libicocco and draghignazzo
    and tusked ciriatto and graffiacane
    and farfarello and mad rubicante

search ye all round about the boiling pitch
    let these be safe as far as the next crag
    that all unbroken passes oer the dens

o me what is it master that i see
    pray let us go i said without an escort
    if thou knowest how since for myself i ask none

if thou art as observant as thy wont is
    dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth
    and with their brows are threatening woe to us

and he to me i will not have thee fear
    let them gnash on according to their fancy
    because they do it for those boiling wretches

along the lefthand dike they wheeled about
    but first had each one thrust his tongue between
    his teeth towards their leader for a signal

and he had made a trumpet of his rump






i have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp
    begin the storming and their muster make
    and sometimes starting off for their escape

vauntcouriers have i seen upon your land
    o aretines and foragers go forth
    tournaments stricken and the joustings run

sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells
    with kettledrums and signals of the castles
    and with our own and with outlandish things

but never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
    did i see horsemen move nor infantry
    nor ship by any sign of land or star

we went upon our way with the ten demons
    ah savage company but in the church
    with saints and in the tavern with the gluttons

ever upon the pitch was my intent
    to see the whole condition of that bolgia
    and of the people who therein were burned

even as the dolphins when they make a sign
    to mariners by arching of the back
    that they should counsel take to save their vessel

thus sometimes to alleviate his pain
    one of the sinners would display his back
    and in less time conceal it than it lightens

as on the brink of water in a ditch
    the frogs stand only with their muzzles out
    so that they hide their feet and other bulk

so upon every side the sinners stood
    but ever as barbariccia near them came
    thus underneath the boiling they withdrew

i saw and still my heart doth shudder at it
    one waiting thus even as it comes to pass
    one frog remains and down another dives

and graffiacan who most confronted him
    grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch
    and drew him up so that he seemed an otter

i knew before the names of all of them
    so had i noted them when they were chosen
    and when they called each other listened how

o rubicante see that thou do lay
    thy claws upon him so that thou mayst flay him
    cried all together the accursed ones

and i my master see to it if thou canst
    that thou mayst know who is the luckless wight
    thus come into his adversaries hands

near to the side of him my leader drew
    asked of him whence he was and he replied
    i in the kingdom of navarre was born

my mother placed me servant to a lord
    for she had borne me to a ribald knave
    destroyer of himself and of his things

then i domestic was of good king thibault
    i set me there to practise barratry
    for which i pay the reckoning in this heat

and ciriatto from whose mouth projected
    on either side a tusk as in a boar
    caused him to feel how one of them could rip

among malicious cats the mouse had come
    but barbariccia clasped him in his arms
    and said stand ye aside while i enfork him

and to my master he turned round his head
    ask him again he said if more thou wish
    to know from him before some one destroy him

the guide now tell then of the other culprits
    knowest thou any one who is a latian
    under the pitch  and he i separated

lately from one who was a neighbour to it
    would that i still were covered up with him
    for i should fear not either claw nor hook

and libicocco we have borne too much
    and with his grapnel seized him by the arm
    so that by rending he tore off a tendon

eke draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
    down at the legs whence their decurion
    turned round and round about with evil look

when they again somewhat were pacified
    of him who still was looking at his wound
    demanded my conductor without stay

who was that one from whom a luckless parting
    thou sayest thou hast made to come ashore
    and he replied it was the friar gomita

he of gallura vessel of all fraud
    who had the enemies of his lord in hand
    and dealt so with them each exults thereat

money he took and let them smoothly off
    as he says and in other offices
    a barrator was he not mean but sovereign

foregathers with him one don michael zanche
    of logodoro and of sardinia
    to gossip never do their tongues feel tired

o me see that one how he grinds his teeth
    still farther would i speak but am afraid
    lest he to scratch my itch be making ready

and the grand provost turned to farfarello
    who rolled his eyes about as if to strike
    said stand aside there thou malicious bird

if you desire either to see or hear
    the terrorstricken recommenced thereon
    tuscans or lombards i will make them come

but let the malebranche cease a little
    so that these may not their revenges fear
    and i down sitting in this very place

for one that i am will make seven come
    when i shall whistle as our custom is
    to do whenever one of us comes out

cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted
    shaking his head and said just hear the trick
    which he has thought of down to throw himself

whence he who snares in great abundance had
    responded i by far too cunning am
    when i procure for mine a greater sadness

alichin held not in but running counter
    unto the rest said to him if thou dive
    i will not follow thee upon the gallop

but i will beat my wings above the pitch
    the height be left and be the bank a shield
    to see if thou alone dost countervail us

o thou who readest thou shalt hear new sport
    each to the other side his eyes averted
    he first who most reluctant was to do it

the navarrese selected well his time
    planted his feet on land and in a moment
    leaped and released himself from their design

whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame
    but he most who was cause of the defeat
    therefore he moved and cried thou art oertakern

but little it availed for wings could not
    outstrip the fear the other one went under
    and flying upward he his breast directed

not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
    dives under when the falcon is approaching
    and upward he returneth cross and weary

infuriate at the mockery calcabrina
    flying behind him followed close desirous
    the other should escape to have a quarrel

and when the barrator had disappeared
    he turned his talons upon his companion
    and grappled with him right above the moat

but sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
    to clapperclaw him well and both of them
    fell in the middle of the boiling pond

a sudden intercessor was the heat
    but neertheless of rising there was naught
    to such degree they had their wings belimed

lamenting with the others barbariccia
    made four of them fly to the other side
    with all their gaffs and very speedily

this side and that they to their posts descended
    they stretched their hooks towards the pitchensnared
    who were already baked within the crust

and in this manner busied did we leave them







silent alone and without company
    we went the one in front the other after
    as go the minor friars along their way

upon the fable of aesop was directed
    my thought by reason of the present quarrel
    where he has spoken of the frog and mouse

for mo and issa are not more alike
    than this one is to that if well we couple
    end and beginning with a steadfast mind

and even as one thought from another springs
    so afterward from that was born another
    which the first fear within me double made

thus did i ponder these on our account
    are laughed to scorn with injury and scoff
    so great that much i think it must annoy them

if anger be engrafted on illwill
    they will come after us more merciless
    than dog upon the leveret which he seizes

i felt my hair stand all on end already
    with terror and stood backwardly intent
    when said i master if thou hidest not

thyself and me forthwith of malebranche
    i am in dread we have them now behind us
    i so imagine them i already feel them

and he if i were made of leaded glass
    thine outward image i should not attract
    sooner to me than i imprint the inner

just now thy thoughts came in among my own
    with similar attitude and similar face
    so that of both one counsel sole i made

if peradventure the right bank so slope
    that we to the next bolgia can descend
    we shall escape from the imagined chase

not yet he finished rendering such opinion
    when i beheld them come with outstretched wings
    not far remote with will to seize upon us

my leader on a sudden seized me up
    even as a mother who by noise is wakened
    and close beside her sees the enkindled flames

who takes her son and flies and does not stop
    having more care of him than of herself
    so that she clothes her only with a shift

and downward from the top of the hard bank
    supine he gave him to the pendent rock
    that one side of the other bolgia walls

neer ran so swiftly water through a sluice
    to turn the wheel of any landbuilt mill
    when nearest to the paddles it approaches

as did my master down along that border
    bearing me with him on his breast away
    as his own son and not as a companion

hardly the bed of the ravine below
    his feet had reached ere they had reached the hill
    right over us but he was not afraid

for the high providence which had ordained
    to place them ministers of the fifth moat
    the power of thence departing took from all

a painted people there below we found
    who went about with footsteps very slow
    weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished

they had on mantles with the hoods low down
    before their eyes and fashioned of the cut
    that in cologne they for the monks are made

without they gilded are so that it dazzles
    but inwardly all leaden and so heavy
    that frederick used to put them on of straw

o everlastingly fatiguing mantle
    again we turned us still to the left hand
    along with them intent on their sad plaint

but owing to the weight that weary folk
    came on so tardily that we were new
    in company at each motion of the haunch

whence i unto my leader see thou find
    some one who may by deed or name be known
    and thus in going move thine eye about

and one who understood the tuscan speech
    cried to us from behind stay ye your feet
    ye who so run athwart the dusky air

perhaps thoult have from me what thou demandest
    whereat the leader turned him and said wait
    and then according to his pace proceed

i stopped and two beheld i show great haste
    of spirit in their faces to be with me
    but the burden and the narrow way delayed them

when they came up long with an eye askance
    they scanned me without uttering a word
    then to each other turned and said together

he by the action of his throat seems living
    and if they dead are by what privilege
    go they uncovered by the heavy stole

then said to me tuscan who to the college
    of miserable hypocrites art come
    do not disdain to tell us who thou art

and i to them born was i and grew up
    in the great town on the fair river of arno
    and with the body am ive always had

but who are ye in whom there trickles down
    along your cheeks such grief as i behold
    and what pain is upon you that so sparkles

and one replied to me these orange cloaks
    are made of lead so heavy that the weights
    cause in this way their balances to creak

frati gaudenti were we and bolognese
    i catalano and he loderingo
    named and together taken by thy city

as the wont is to take one man alone
    for maintenance of its peace and we were such
    that still it is apparent round gardingo

o friars began i your iniquitous  
    but said no more for to mine eyes there rushed
    one crucified with three stakes on the ground

when me he saw he writhed himself all over
    blowing into his beard with suspirations
    and the friar catalan who noticed this

said to me this transfixed one whom thou seest
    counselled the pharisees that it was meet
    to put one man to torture for the people

crosswise and naked is he on the path
    as thou perceivest and he needs must feel
    whoever passes first how much he weighs

and in like mode his fatherinlaw is punished
    within this moat and the others of the council
    which for the jews was a malignant seed

and thereupon i saw virgilius marvel
    oer him who was extended on the cross
    so vilely in eternal banishment

then he directed to the friar this voice
    be not displeased if granted thee to tell us
    if to the right hand any pass slope down

by which we two may issue forth from here
    without constraining some of the black angels
    to come and extricate us from this deep

then he made answer nearer than thou hopest
    there is a rock that forth from the great circle
    proceeds and crosses all the cruel valleys

save that at this tis broken and does not bridge it
    you will be able to mount up the ruin
    that sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises

the leader stood awhile with head bowed down
    then said the business badly he recounted
    who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder

and the friar many of the devils vices
    once heard i at bologna and among them
    that hes a liar and the father of lies

thereat my leader with great strides went on
    somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks
    whence from the heavyladen i departed

after the prints of his beloved feet






in that part of the youthful year wherein
    the sun his locks beneath aquarius tempers
    and now the nights draw near to half the day

what time the hoarfrost copies on the ground
    the outward semblance of her sister white
    but little lasts the temper of her pen

the husbandman whose forage faileth him
    rises and looks and seeth the champaign
    all gleaming white whereat he beats his flank

returns in doors and up and down laments
    like a poor wretch who knows not what to do
    then he returns and hope revives again

seeing the world has changed its countenance
    in little time and takes his shepherds crook
    and forth the little lambs to pasture drives

thus did the master fill me with alarm
    when i beheld his forehead so disturbed
    and to the ailment came as soon the plaster

for as we came unto the ruined bridge
    the leader turned to me with that sweet look
    which at the mountains foot i first beheld

his arms he opened after some advisement
    within himself elected looking first
    well at the ruin and laid hold of me

and even as he who acts and meditates
    for aye it seems that he provides beforehand
    so upward lifting me towards the summit

of a huge rock he scanned another crag
    saying to that one grapple afterwards
    but try first if tis such that it will hold thee

this was no way for one clothed with a cloak
    for hardly we he light and i pushed upward
    were able to ascend from jag to jag

and had it not been that upon that precinct
    shorter was the ascent than on the other
    he i know not but i had been dead beat

but because malebolge towrds the mouth
    of the profoundest well is all inclining
    the structure of each valley doth import

that one bank rises and the other sinks
    still we arrived at length upon the point
    wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder

the breath was from my lungs so milked away
    when i was up that i could go no farther
    nay i sat down upon my first arrival

now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth
    my master said for sitting upon down
    or under quilt one cometh not to fame

withouten which whoso his life consumes
    such vestige leaveth of himself on earth
    as smoke in air or in the water foam

and therefore raise thee up oercome the anguish
    with spirit that oercometh every battle
    if with its heavy body it sink not

a longer stairway it behoves thee mount
    tis not enough from these to have departed
    let it avail thee if thou understand me

then i uprose showing myself provided
    better with breath than i did feel myself
    and said go on for i am strong and bold

upward we took our way along the crag
    which jagged was and narrow and difficult
    and more precipitous far than that before

speaking i went not to appear exhausted
    whereat a voice from the next moat came forth
    not well adapted to articulate words

i know not what it said though oer the back
    i now was of the arch that passes there
    but he seemed moved to anger who was speaking

i was bent downward but my living eyes
    could not attain the bottom for the dark
    wherefore i master see that thou arrive

at the next round and let us descend the wall
    for as from hence i hear and understand not
    so i look down and nothing i distinguish

other response he said i make thee not
    except the doing for the modest asking
    ought to be followed by the deed in silence

we from the bridge descended at its head
    where it connects itself with the eighth bank
    and then was manifest to me the bolgia

and i beheld therein a terrible throng
    of serpents and of such a monstrous kind
    that the remembrance still congeals my blood

let libya boast no longer with her sand
    for if chelydri jaculi and phareae
    she breeds with cenchri and with amphisbaena

neither so many plagues nor so malignant
    eer showed she with all ethiopia
    nor with whatever on the red sea is

among this cruel and most dismal throng
    people were running naked and affrighted
    without the hope of hole or heliotrope

they had their hands with serpents bound behind them
    these riveted upon their reins the tail
    and head and were in front of them entwined

and lo at one who was upon our side
    there darted forth a serpent which transfixed him
    there where the neck is knotted to the shoulders

nor o so quickly eer nor i was written
    as he took fire and burned and ashes wholly
    behoved it that in falling he became

and when he on the ground was thus destroyed
    the ashes drew together and of themselves
    into himself they instantly returned

even thus by the great sages tis confessed
    the phoenix dies and then is born again
    when it approaches its fivehundredth year

on herb or grain it feeds not in its life
    but only on tears of incense and amomum
    and nard and myrrh are its last windingsheet

and as he is who falls and knows not how
    by force of demons who to earth down drag him
    or other oppilation that binds man

when he arises and around him looks
    wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
    which he has suffered and in looking sighs

such was that sinner after he had risen
    justice of god o how severe it is
    that blows like these in vengeance poureth down

the guide thereafter asked him who he was
    whence he replied i rained from tuscany
    a short time since into this cruel gorge

a bestial life and not a human pleased me
    even as the mule i was im vanni fucci
    beast and pistoia was my worthy den

and i unto the guide tell him to stir not
    and ask what crime has thrust him here below
    for once a man of blood and wrath i saw him

and the sinner who had heard dissembled not
    but unto me directed mind and face
    and with a melancholy shame was painted

then said it pains me more that thou hast caught me
    amid this misery where thou seest me
    than when i from the other life was taken

what thou demandest i cannot deny
    so low am i put down because i robbed
    the sacristy of the fair ornaments

and falsely once twas laid upon another
    but that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy
    if thou shalt eer be out of the dark places

thine ears to my announcement ope and hear
    pistoia first of neri groweth meagre
    then florence doth renew her men and manners

mars draws a vapour up from val di magra
    which is with turbid clouds enveloped round
    and with impetuous and bitter tempest

over campo picen shall be the battle
    when it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder
    so that each bianco shall thereby be smitten

and this ive said that it may give thee pain







at the conclusion of his words the thief
    lifted his hands aloft with both the figs
    crying take that god for at thee i aim them

from that time forth the serpents were my friends
    for one entwined itself about his neck
    as if it said i will not thou speak more

and round his arms another and rebound him
    clinching itself together so in front
    that with them he could not a motion make

pistoia ah pistoia why resolve not
    to burn thyself to ashes and so perish
    since in illdoing thou thy seed excellest

through all the sombre circles of this hell
    spirit i saw not against god so proud
    not he who fell at thebes down from the walls

he fled away and spake no further word
    and i beheld a centaur full of rage
    come crying out where is where is the scoffer

i do not think maremma has so many
    serpents as he had all along his back
    as far as where our countenance begins

upon the shoulders just behind the nape
    with wings wide open was a dragon lying
    and he sets fire to all that he encounters

my master said that one is cacus who
    beneath the rock upon mount aventine
    created oftentimes a lake of blood

he goes not on the same road with his brothers
    by reason of the fraudulent theft he made
    of the great herd which he had near to him

whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
    the mace of hercules who peradventure
    gave him a hundred and he felt not ten

while he was speaking thus he had passed by
    and spirits three had underneath us come
    of which nor i aware was nor my leader

until what time they shouted who are you
    on which account our story made a halt
    and then we were intent on them alone

i did not know them but it came to pass
    as it is wont to happen by some chance
    that one to name the other was compelled

exclaiming where can cianfa have remained
    whence i so that the leader might attend
    upward from chin to nose my finger laid

if thou art reader slow now to believe
    what i shall say it will no marvel be
    for i who saw it hardly can admit it

as i was holding raised on them my brows
    behold a serpent with six feet darts forth
    in front of one and fastens wholly on him

with middle feet it bound him round the paunch
    and with the forward ones his arms it seized
    then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other

the hindermost it stretched upon his thighs
    and put its tail through in between the two
    and up behind along the reins outspread it

ivy was never fastened by its barbs
    unto a tree so as this horrible reptile
    upon the others limbs entwined its own

then they stuck close as if of heated wax
    they had been made and intermixed their colour
    nor one nor other seemed now what he was

een as proceedeth on before the flame
    upward along the paper a brown colour
    which is not black as yet and the white dies

the other two looked on and each of them
    cried out o me agnello how thou changest
    behold thou now art neither two nor one

already the two heads had one become
    when there appeared to us two figures mingled
    into one face wherein the two were lost

of the four lists were fashioned the two arms
    the thighs and legs the belly and the chest
    members became that never yet were seen

every original aspect there was cancelled
    two and yet none did the perverted image
    appear and such departed with slow pace

even as a lizard under the great scourge
    of days canicular exchanging hedge
    lightning appeareth if the road it cross

thus did appear coming towards the bellies
    of the two others a small fiery serpent
    livid and black as is a peppercorn

and in that part whereat is first received
    our aliment it one of them transfixed
    then downward fell in front of him extended

the one transfixed looked at it but said naught
    nay rather with feet motionless he yawned
    just as if sleep or fever had assailed him

he at the serpent gazed and it at him
    one through the wound the other through the mouth
    smoked violently and the smoke commingled

henceforth be silent lucan where he mentions
    wretched sabellus and nassidius
    and wait to hear what now shall be shot forth

be silent ovid of cadmus and arethusa
    for if him to a snake her to fountain
    converts he fabling that i grudge him not

because two natures never front to front
    has he transmuted so that both the forms
    to interchange their matter ready were

together they responded in such wise
    that to a fork the serpent cleft his tail
    and eke the wounded drew his feet together

the legs together with the thighs themselves
    adhered so that in little time the juncture
    no sign whatever made that was apparent

he with the cloven tail assumed the figure
    the other one was losing and his skin
    became elastic and the others hard

i saw the arms draw inward at the armpits
    and both feet of the reptile that were short
    lengthen as much as those contracted were

thereafter the hind feet together twisted
    became the member that a man conceals
    and of his own the wretch had two created

while both of them the exhalation veils
    with a new colour and engenders hair
    on one of them and depilates the other

the one uprose and down the other fell
    though turning not away their impious lamps
    underneath which each one his muzzle changed

he who was standing drew it towrds the temples
    and from excess of matter which came thither
    issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks

what did not backward run and was retained
    of that excess made to the face a nose
    and the lips thickened far as was befitting

he who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward
    and backward draws the ears into his head
    in the same manner as the snail its horns

and so the tongue which was entire and apt
    for speech before is cleft and the biforked
    in the other closes up and the smoke ceases

the soul which to a reptile had been changed
    along the valley hissing takes to flight
    and after him the other speaking sputters

then did he turn upon him his new shoulders
    and said to the other ill have buoso run
    crawling as i have done along this road

in this way i beheld the seventh ballast
    shift and reshift and here be my excuse
    the novelty if aught my pen transgress

and notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
    somewhat bewildered and my mind dismayed
    they could not flee away so secretly

but that i plainly saw puccio sciancato
    and he it was who sole of three companions
    which came in the beginning was not changed

the other was he whom thou gaville weepest







rejoice o florence since thou art so great
    that over sea and land thou beatest thy wings
    and throughout hell thy name is spread abroad

among the thieves five citizens of thine
    like these i found whence shame comes unto me
    and thou thereby to no great honour risest

but if when morn is near our dreams are true
    feel shalt thou in a little time from now
    what prato if none other craves for thee

and if it now were it were not too soon
    would that it were seeing it needs must be
    for twill aggrieve me more the more i age

we went our way and up along the stairs
    the bourns had made us to descend before
    remounted my conductor and drew me

and following the solitary path
    among the rocks and ridges of the crag
    the foot without the hand sped not at all

then sorrowed i and sorrow now again
    when i direct my mind to what i saw
    and more my genius curb than i am wont

that it may run not unless virtue guide it
    so that if some good star or better thing
    have given me good i may myself not grudge it

as many as the hind 
    seeth the glowworms down along the valley
    perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage

with flames as manifold resplendent all
    was the eighth bolgia as i grew aware
    as soon as i was where the depth appeared

and such as he who with the bears avenged him
    beheld elijahs chariot at departing
    what time the steeds to heaven erect uprose

for with his eye he could not follow it
    so as to see aught else than flame alone
    even as a little cloud ascending upward

thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
    was moving for not one reveals the theft
    and every flame a sinner steals away

i stood upon the bridge uprisen to see
    so that if i had seized not on a rock
    down had i fallen without being pushed

and the leader who beheld me so attent
    exclaimed within the fires the spirits are
    each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns

my master i replied by hearing thee
    i am more sure but i surmised already
    it might be so and already wished to ask thee

who is within that fire which comes so cleft
    at top it seems uprising from the pyre
    where was eteocles with his brother placed

he answered me within there are tormented
    ulysses and diomed and thus together
    they unto vengeance run as unto wrath

and there within their flame do they lament
    the ambush of the horse which made the door
    whence issued forth the romans gentle seed

therein is wept the craft for which being dead
    deidamia still deplores achilles
    and pain for the palladium there is borne

if they within those sparks possess the power
    to speak i said thee master much i pray
    and repray that the prayer be worth a thousand

that thou make no denial of awaiting
    until the horned flame shall hither come
    thou seest that with desire i lean towards it

and he to me worthy is thy entreaty
    of much applause and therefore i accept it
    but take heed that thy tongue restrain itself

leave me to speak because i have conceived
    that which thou wishest for they might disdain
    perchance since they were greeks discourse of thine

when now the flame had come unto that point
    where to my leader it seemed time and place
    after this fashion did i hear him speak

o ye who are twofold within one fire
    if i deserved of you while i was living
    if i deserved of you or much or little

when in the world i wrote the lofty verses
    do not move on but one of you declare
    whither being lost he went away to die

then of the antique flame the greater horn
    murmuring began to wave itself about
    even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues

thereafterward the summit to and fro
    moving as if it were the tongue that spake
    it uttered forth a voice and said when i

from circe had departed who concealed me
    more than a year there near unto gaeta
    or ever yet aeneas named it so

nor fondness for my son nor reverence
    for my old father nor the due affection
    which joyous should have made penelope

could overcome within me the desire
    i had to be experienced of the world
    and of the vice and virtue of mankind

but i put forth on the high open sea
    with one sole ship and that small company
    by which i never had deserted been

both of the shores i saw as far as spain
    far as morocco and the isle of sardes
    and the others which that sea bathes round about

i and my company were old and slow
    when at that narrow passage we arrived
    where hercules his landmarks set as signals

that man no farther onward should adventure
    on the right hand behind me left i seville
    and on the other already had left ceuta

o brothers who amid a hundred thousand
    perils i said have come unto the west
    to this so inconsiderable vigil

which is remaining of your senses still
    be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge
    following the sun of the unpeopled world

consider ye the seed from which ye sprang
    ye were not made to live like unto brutes
    but for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge

so eager did i render my companions
    with this brief exhortation for the voyage
    that then i hardly could have held them back

and having turned our stern unto the morning
    we of the oars made wings for our mad flight
    evermore gaining on the larboard side

already all the stars of the other pole
    the night beheld and ours so very low
    it did not rise above the ocean floor

five times rekindled and as many quenched
    had been the splendour underneath the moon
    since we had entered into the deep pass

when there appeared to us a mountain dim
    from distance and it seemed to me so high
    as i had never any one beheld

joyful were we and soon it turned to weeping
    for out of the new land a whirlwind rose
    and smote upon the fore part of the ship

three times it made her whirl with all the waters
    at the fourth time it made the stern uplift
    and the prow downward go as pleased another

until the sea above us closed again







already was the flame erect and quiet
    to speak no more and now departed from us
    with the permission of the gentle poet

when yet another which behind it came
    caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
    by a confused sound that issued from it

as the sicilian bull 

bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted
    that notwithstanding it was made of brass
    still it appeared with agony transfixed

thus by not having any way or issue
    at first from out the fire to its own language
    converted were the melancholy words

but afterwards when they had gathered way
    up through the point giving it that vibration
    the tongue had given them in their passage out

we heard it said o thou at whom i aim
    my voice and who but now wast speaking lombard
    saying now go thy way no more i urge thee

because i come perchance a little late
    to stay and speak with me let it not irk thee
    thou seest it irks not me and i am burning

if thou but lately into this blind world
    hast fallen down from that sweet latian land
    wherefrom i bring the whole of my transgression

say if the romagnuols have peace or war
    for i was from the mountains there between
    urbino and the yoke whence tiber bursts

i still was downward bent and listening
    when my conductor touched me on the side
    saying speak thou this one a latian is

and i who had beforehand my reply
    in readiness forthwith began to speak
    o soul that down below there art concealed

romagna thine is not and never has been
    without war in the bosom of its tyrants
    but open war i none have left there now

ravenna stands as it long years has stood
    the eagle of polenta there is brooding
    so that she covers cervia with her vans

the city which once made the long resistance
    and of the french a sanguinary heap
    beneath the green paws finds itself again

verrucchios ancient mastiff and the new
    who made such bad disposal of montagna
    where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth

the cities of lamone and santerno
    governs the lioncel of the white lair
    who changes sides twixt summertime and winter

and that of which the savio bathes the flank
    even as it lies between the plain and mountain
    lives between tyranny and a free state

now i entreat thee tell us who thou art
    be not more stubborn than the rest have been
    so may thy name hold front there in the world

after the fire a little more had roared
    in its own fashion the sharp point it moved
    this way and that and then gave forth such breath

if i believed that my reply were made
    to one who to the world would eer return
    this flame without more flickering would stand still

but inasmuch as never from this depth
    did any one return if i hear true
    without the fear of infamy i answer

i was a man of arms then cordelier
    believing thus begirt to make amends
    and truly my belief had been fulfilled

but for the high priest whom may ill betide
    who put me back into my former sins
    and how and wherefore i will have thee hear

while i was still the form of bone and pulp
    my mother gave to me the deeds i did
    were not those of a lion but a fox

the machinations and the covert ways
    i knew them all and practised so their craft
    that to the ends of earth the sound went forth

when now unto that portion of mine age
    i saw myself arrived when each one ought
    to lower the sails and coil away the ropes

that which before had pleased me then displeased me
    and penitent and confessing i surrendered
    ah woe is me and it would have bestead me

the leader of the modern pharisees
    having a war near unto lateran
    and not with saracens nor with the jews

for each one of his enemies was christian
    and none of them had been to conquer acre
    nor merchandising in the sultans land

nor the high office nor the sacred orders
    in him regarded nor in me that cord
    which used to make those girt with it more meagre

but even as constantine sought out sylvester
    to cure his leprosy within soracte
    so this one sought me out as an adept

to cure him of the fever of his pride
    counsel he asked of me and i was silent
    because his words appeared inebriate

and then he said be not thy heart afraid
    henceforth i thee absolve and thou instruct me
    how to raze palestrina to the ground

heaven have i power to lock and to unlock
    as thou dost know therefore the keys are two
    the which my predecessor held not dear

then urged me on his weighty arguments
    there where my silence was the worst advice
    and said i father since thou washest me

of that sin into which i now must fall
    the promise long with the fulfilment short
    will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat

francis came afterward when i was dead
    for me but one of the black cherubim
    said to him take him not do me no wrong

he must come down among my servitors
    because he gave the fraudulent advice
    from which time forth i have been at his hair

for who repents not cannot be absolved
    nor can one both repent and will at once
    because of the contradiction which consents not

o miserable me how i did shudder
    when he seized on me saying peradventure
    thou didst not think that i was a logician

he bore me unto minos who entwined
    eight times his tail about his stubborn back
    and after he had bitten it in great rage

said of the thievish fire a culprit this
    wherefore here where thou seest am i lost
    and vested thus in going i bemoan me

when it had thus completed its recital
    the flame departed uttering lamentations
    writhing and flapping its sharppointed horn

onward we passed both i and my conductor
    up oer the crag above another arch
    which the moat covers where is paid the fee

by those who sowing discord win their burden







who ever could een with untrammelled words
    tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
    which now i saw by many times narrating

each tongue would for a certainty fall short
    by reason of our speech and memory
    that have small room to comprehend so much

if were again assembled all the people
    which formerly upon the fateful land
    of puglia were lamenting for their blood

shed by the romans and the lingering war
    that of the rings made such illustrious spoils
    as livy has recorded who errs not

with those who felt the agony of blows
    by making counterstand to robert guiscard
    and all the rest whose bones are gathered still

at ceperano where a renegade
    was each apulian and at tagliacozzo
    where without arms the old alardo conquered

and one his limb transpierced and one lopped off
    should show it would be nothing to compare
    with the disgusting mode of the ninth bolgia

a cask by losing centrepiece or cant
    was never shattered so as i saw one
    rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind

between his legs were hanging down his entrails
    his heart was visible and the dismal sack
    that maketh excrement of what is eaten

while i was all absorbed in seeing him
    he looked at me and opened with his hands
    his bosom saying see now how i rend me

how mutilated see is mahomet
    in front of me doth ali weeping go
    cleft in the face from forelock unto chin

and all the others whom thou here beholdest
    disseminators of scandal and of schism
    while living were and therefore are cleft thus

a devil is behind here who doth cleave us
    thus cruelly unto the falchions edge
    putting again each one of all this ream

when we have gone around the doleful road
    by reason that our wounds are closed again
    ere any one in front of him repass

but who art thou that musest on the crag
    perchance to postpone going to the pain
    that is adjudged upon thine accusations

nor death hath reached him yet nor guilt doth bring him
    my master made reply to be tormented
    but to procure him full experience

me who am dead behoves it to conduct him
    down here through hell from circle unto circle
    and this is true as that i speak to thee

more than a hundred were there when they heard him
    who in the moat stood still to look at me
    through wonderment oblivious of their torture

now say to fra dolcino then to arm him
    thou who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun
    if soon he wish not here to follow me

so with provisions that no stress of snow
    may give the victory to the novarese
    which otherwise to gain would not be easy

after one foot to go away he lifted
    this word did mahomet say unto me
    then to depart upon the ground he stretched it

another one who had his throat pierced through
    and nose cut off close underneath the brows
    and had no longer but a single ear

staying to look in wonder with the others
    before the others did his gullet open
    which outwardly was red in every part

and said o thou whom guilt doth not condemn
    and whom i once saw up in latian land
    unless too great similitude deceive me

call to remembrance pier da medicina
    if eer thou see again the lovely plain
    that from vercelli slopes to marcabo

and make it known to the best two of fano
    to messer guido and angiolello likewise
    that if foreseeing here be not in vain

cast over from their vessel shall they be
    and drowned near unto the cattolica
    by the betrayal of a tyrant fell

between the isles of cyprus and majorca
    neptune neer yet beheld so great a crime
    neither of pirates nor argolic people

that traitor who sees only with one eye
    and holds the land which some one here with me
    would fain be fasting from the vision of

will make them come unto a parley with him
    then will do so that to focaras wind
    they will not stand in need of vow or prayer

and i to him show to me and declare
    if thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee
    who is this person of the bitter vision

then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
    of one of his companions and his mouth
    oped crying this is he and he speaks not

this one being banished every doubt submerged
    in caesar by affirming the forearmed
    always with detriment allowed delay

o how bewildered unto me appeared
    with tongue asunder in his windpipe slit
    curio who in speaking was so bold

and one who both his hands dissevered had
    the stumps uplifting through the murky air
    so that the blood made horrible his face

cried out thou shalt remember mosca also
    who said alas a thing done has an end
    which was an ill seed for the tuscan people

and death unto thy race thereto i added
    whence he accumulating woe on woe
    departed like a person sad and crazed

but i remained to look upon the crowd
    and saw a thing which i should be afraid
    without some further proof even to recount

if it were not that conscience reassures me
    that good companion which emboldens man
    beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure

i truly saw and still i seem to see it
    a trunk without a head walk in like manner
    as walked the others of the mournful herd

and by the hair it held the head dissevered
    hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern
    and that upon us gazed and said o me

it of itself made to itself a lamp
    and they were two in one and one in two
    how that can be he knows who so ordains it

when it was come close to the bridges foot
    it lifted high its arm with all the head
    to bring more closely unto us its words

which were behold now the sore penalty
    thou who dost breathing go the dead beholding
    behold if any be as great as this

and so that thou may carry news of me
    know that bertram de born am i the same
    who gave to the young king the evil comfort

i made the father and the son rebellious
    achitophel not more with absalom
    and david did with his accursed goadings

because i parted persons so united
    parted do i now bear my brain alas
    from its beginning which is in this trunk

thus is observed in me the counterpoise







the many people and the divers wounds
    these eyes of mine had so inebriated
    that they were wishful to stand still and weep

but said virgilius what dost thou still gaze at
    why is thy sight still riveted down there
    among the mournful mutilated shades

thou hast not done so at the other bolge
    consider if to count them thou believest
    that twoandtwenty miles the valley winds

and now the moon is underneath our feet
    henceforth the time allotted us is brief
    and more is to be seen than what thou seest

if thou hadst i made answer thereupon
    attended to the cause for which i looked
    perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned

meanwhile my guide departed and behind him
    i went already making my reply
    and superadding in that cavern where

i held mine eyes with such attention fixed
    i think a spirit of my blood laments
    the sin which down below there costs so much

then said the master be no longer broken
    thy thought from this time forward upon him
    attend elsewhere and there let him remain

for him i saw below the little bridge
    pointing at thee and threatening with his finger
    fiercely and heard him called geri del bello

so wholly at that time wast thou impeded
    by him who formerly held altaforte
    thou didst not look that way so he departed

o my conductor his own violent death
    which is not yet avenged for him i said
    by any who is sharer in the shame

made him disdainful whence he went away
    as i imagine without speaking to me
    and thereby made me pity him the more

thus did we speak as far as the first place
    upon the crag which the next valley shows
    down to the bottom if there were more light

when we were now right over the last cloister
    of malebolge so that its laybrothers
    could manifest themselves unto our sight

divers lamentings pierced me through and through
    which with compassion had their arrows barbed
    whereat mine ears i covered with my hands

what pain would be if from the hospitals
    of valdichiana twixt july and september
    and of maremma and sardinia

all the diseases in one moat were gathered
    such was it here and such a stench came from it
    as from putrescent limbs is wont to issue

we had descended on the furthest bank
    from the long crag upon the left hand still
    and then more vivid was my power of sight

down towrds the bottom where the ministress
    of the high lord justice infallible
    punishes forgers which she here records

i do not think a sadder sight to see
    was in aegina the whole people sick
    
    than was it to behold through that dark valley
    the spirits languishing in divers heaps

this on the belly that upon the back
    one of the other lay and others crawling
    shifted themselves along the dismal road

we step by step went onward without speech
    gazing upon and listening to the sick
    who had not strength enough to lift their bodies

i saw two sitting leaned against each other
    as leans in heating platter against platter
    from head to foot bespotted oer with scabs

and never saw i plied a currycomb
    by stableboy for whom his master waits
    or him who keeps awake unwillingly

as every one was plying fast the bite
    of nails upon himself for the great rage
    of itching which no other succour had

and the nails downward with them dragged the scab
    in fashion as a knife the scales of bream
    or any other fish that has them largest

o thou that with thy fingers dost dismail thee
    began my leader unto one of them
    and makest of them pincers now and then

tell me if any latian is with those
    who are herein so may thy nails suffice thee
    to all eternity unto this work

latians are we whom thou so wasted seest
    both of us here one weeping made reply
    but who art thou that questionest about us

and said the guide one am i who descends
    down with this living man from cliff to cliff
    and i intend to show hell unto him

then broken was their mutual support
    and trembling each one turned himself to me
    with others who had heard him by rebound

wholly to me did the good master gather
    saying say unto them whateer thou wishest
    and i began since he would have it so

so may your memory not steal away
    in the first world from out the minds of men
    but so may it survive neath many suns

say to me who ye are and of what people
    let not your foul and loathsome punishment
    make you afraid to show yourselves to me

i of arezzo was one made reply
    and albert of siena had me burned
    but what i died for does not bring me here

tis true i said to him speaking in jest
    that i could rise by flight into the air
    and he who had conceit but little wit

would have me show to him the art and only
    because no daedalus i made him made me
    be burned by one who held him as his son

but unto the last bolgia of the ten
    for alchemy which in the world i practised
    minos who cannot err has me condemned

and to the poet said i now was ever
    so vain a people as the sienese
    not for a certainty the french by far

whereat the other leper who had heard me
    replied unto my speech taking out stricca
    who knew the art of moderate expenses

and niccolo who the luxurious use
    of cloves discovered earliest of all
    within that garden where such seed takes root

and taking out the band among whom squandered
    caccia dascian his vineyards and vast woods
    and where his wit the abbagliato proffered

but that thou know who thus doth second thee
    against the sienese make sharp thine eye
    towrds me so that my face well answer thee

and thou shalt see i am capocchios shade
    who metals falsified by alchemy
    thou must remember if i well descry thee

how i a skilful ape of nature was







twas at the time when juno was enraged
    for semele against the theban blood
    as she already more than once had shown

so reft of reason athamas became
    that seeing his own wife with children twain
    walking encumbered upon either hand

he cried spread out the nets that i may take
    the lioness and her whelps upon the passage
    and then extended his unpitying claws

seizing the first who had the name learchus
    and whirled him round and dashed him on a rock
    and she with the other burthen drowned herself

and at the time when fortune downward hurled
    the trojans arrogance that all things dared
    so that the king was with his kingdom crushed

hecuba sad disconsolate and captive
    when lifeless she beheld polyxena
    and of her polydorus on the shore

of ocean was the dolorous one aware
    out of her senses like a dog she barked
    so much the anguish had her mind distorted

but not of thebes the furies nor the trojan
    were ever seen in any one so cruel
    in goading beasts and much more human members

as i beheld two shadows pale and naked
    who biting in the manner ran along
    that a boar does when from the sty turned loose

one to capocchio came and by the nape
    seized with its teeth his neck so that in dragging
    it made his belly grate the solid bottom

and the aretine who trembling had remained
    said to me that mad sprite is gianni schicchi
    and raving goes thus harrying other people

o said i to him so may not the other
    set teeth on thee let it not weary thee
    to tell us who it is ere it dart hence

and he to me that is the ancient ghost
    of the nefarious myrrha who became
    beyond all rightful love her fathers lover

she came to sin with him after this manner
    by counterfeiting of anothers form
    as he who goeth yonder undertook

that he might gain the lady of the herd
    to counterfeit in himself buoso donati
    making a will and giving it due form

and after the two maniacs had passed
    on whom i held mine eye i turned it back
    to look upon the other evilborn

i saw one made in fashion of a lute
    if he had only had the groin cut off
    just at the point at which a man is forked

the heavy dropsy that so disproportions
    the limbs with humours which it ill concocts
    that the face corresponds not to the belly

compelled him so to hold his lips apart
    as does the hectic who because of thirst
    one towrds the chin the other upward turns

o ye who without any torment are
    and why i know not in the world of woe
    he said to us behold and be attentive

unto the misery of master adam
    i had while living much of what i wished
    and now alas a drop of water crave

the rivulets that from the verdant hills
    of cassentin descend down into arno
    making their channels to be cold and moist

ever before me stand and not in vain
    for far more doth their image dry me up
    than the disease which strips my face of flesh

the rigid justice that chastises me
    draweth occasion from the place in which
    i sinned to put the more my sighs in flight

there is romena where i counterfeited
    the currency imprinted with the baptist
    for which i left my body burned above

but if i here could see the tristful soul
    of guido or alessandro or their brother
    for brandas fount i would not give the sight

one is within already if the raving
    shades that are going round about speak truth
    but what avails it me whose limbs are tied

if i were only still so light that in
    a hundred years i could advance one inch
    i had already started on the way

seeking him out among this squalid folk
    although the circuit be eleven miles
    and be not less than half a mile across

for them am i in such a family
    they did induce me into coining florins
    which had three carats of impurity

and i to him who are the two poor wretches
    that smoke like unto a wet hand in winter
    lying there close upon thy righthand confines

i found them here replied he when i rained
    into this chasm and since they have not turned
    nor do i think they will for evermore

one the false woman is who accused joseph
    the other the false sinon greek of troy
    from acute fever they send forth such reek

and one of them who felt himself annoyed
    at being peradventure named so darkly
    smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch

it gave a sound as if it were a drum
    and master adam smote him in the face
    with arm that did not seem to be less hard

saying to him although be taken from me
    all motion for my limbs that heavy are
    i have an arm unfettered for such need

whereat he answer made when thou didst go
    unto the fire thou hadst it not so ready
    but hadst it so and more when thou wast coining

the dropsical thou sayest true in that
    but thou wast not so true a witness there
    where thou wast questioned of the truth at troy

if i spake false thou falsifiedst the coin
    said sinon and for one fault i am here
    and thou for more than any other demon

remember perjurer about the horse
    he made reply who had the swollen belly
    and rueful be it thee the whole world knows it

rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
    thy tongue the greek said and the putrid water
    that hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes

then the falsecoiner so is gaping wide
    thy mouth for speaking evil as tis wont
    because if i have thirst and humour stuff me

thou hast the burning and the head that aches
    and to lick up the mirror of narcissus
    thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee

in listening to them was i wholly fixed
    when said the master to me now just look
    for little wants it that i quarrel with thee

when him i heard in anger speak to me
    i turned me round towards him with such shame
    that still it eddies through my memory

and as he is who dreams of his own harm
    who dreaming wishes it may be a dream
    so that he craves what is as if it were not

such i became not having power to speak
    for to excuse myself i wished and still
    excused myself and did not think i did it

less shame doth wash away a greater fault
    the master said than this of thine has been
    therefore thyself disburden of all sadness

and make account that i am aye beside thee
    if eer it come to pass that fortune bring thee
    where there are people in a like dispute

for a base wish it is to wish to hear it






one and the selfsame tongue first wounded me
    so that it tinged the one cheek and the other
    and then held out to me the medicine

thus do i hear that once achilles spear
    his and his fathers used to be the cause
    first of a sad and then a gracious boon

we turned our backs upon the wretched valley
    upon the bank that girds it round about
    going across it without any speech

there it was less than night and less than day
    so that my sight went little in advance
    but i could hear the blare of a loud horn

so loud it would have made each thunder faint
    which counter to it following its way
    mine eyes directed wholly to one place

after the dolorous discomfiture
    when charlemagne the holy emprise lost
    so terribly orlando sounded not

short while my head turned thitherward i held
    when many lofty towers i seemed to see
    whereat i master say what town is this

and he to me because thou peerest forth
    athwart the darkness at too great a distance
    it happens that thou errest in thy fancy

well shalt thou see if thou arrivest there
    how much the sense deceives itself by distance
    therefore a little faster spur thee on

then tenderly he took me by the hand
    and said before we farther have advanced
    that the reality may seem to thee

less strange know that these are not towers but giants
    and they are in the well around the bank
    from navel downward one and all of them

as when the fog is vanishing away
    little by little doth the sight refigure
    whateer the mist that crowds the air conceals

so piercing through the dense and darksome air
    more and more near approaching towrd the verge
    my error fled and fear came over me

because as on its circular parapets
    montereggione crowns itself with towers
    een thus the margin which surrounds the well

with one half of their bodies turreted
    the horrible giants whom jove menaces
    een now from out the heavens when he thunders

and i of one already saw the face
    shoulders and breast and great part of the belly
    and down along his sides both of the arms

certainly nature when she left the making
    of animals like these did well indeed
    by taking such executors from mars

and if of elephants and whales she doth not
    repent her whosoever looketh subtly
    more just and more discreet will hold her for it

for where the argument of intellect
    is added unto evil will and power
    no rampart can the people make against it

his face appeared to me as long and large
    as is at rome the pinecone of saint peters
    and in proportion were the other bones

so that the margin which an apron was
    down from the middle showed so much of him
    above it that to reach up to his hair

three frieslanders in vain had vaunted them
    for i beheld thirty great palms of him
    down from the place where man his mantle buckles

raphael mai amech izabi almi
    began to clamour the ferocious mouth
    to which were not befitting sweeter psalms

and unto him my guide soul idiotic
    keep to thy horn and vent thyself with that
    when wrath or other passion touches thee

search round thy neck and thou wilt find the belt
    which keeps it fastened o bewildered soul
    and see it where it bars thy mighty breast

then said to me he doth himself accuse
    this one is nimrod by whose evil thought
    one language in the world is not still used

here let us leave him and not speak in vain
    for even such to him is every language
    as his to others which to none is known

therefore a longer journey did we make
    turned to the left and a crossbowshot oft
    we found another far more fierce and large

in binding him who might the master be
    i cannot say but he had pinioned close
    behind the right arm and in front the other

with chains that held him so begirt about
    from the neck down that on the part uncovered
    it wound itself as far as the fifth gyre

this proud one wished to make experiment
    of his own power against the supreme jove
    my leader said whence he has such a guerdon

ephialtes is his name he showed great prowess
    what time the giants terrified the gods
    the arms he wielded never more he moves

and i to him if possible i should wish
    that of the measureless briareus
    these eyes of mine might have experience

whence he replied thou shalt behold antaeus
    close by here who can speak and is unbound
    who at the bottom of all crime shall place us

much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see
    and he is bound and fashioned like to this one
    save that he seems in aspect more ferocious

there never was an earthquake of such might
    that it could shake a tower so violently
    as ephialtes suddenly shook himself

then was i more afraid of death than ever
    for nothing more was needful than the fear
    if i had not beheld the manacles

then we proceeded farther in advance
    and to antaeus came who full five ells
    without the head forth issued from the cavern

o thou who in the valley fortunate
    which scipio the heir of glory made
    when hannibal turned back with all his hosts

once broughtst a thousand lions for thy prey
    and who hadst thou been at the mighty war
    among thy brothers some it seems still think

the sons of earth the victory would have gained
    place us below nor be disdainful of it
    there where the cold doth lock cocytus up

make us not go to tityus nor typhoeus
    this one can give of that which here is longed for
    therefore stoop down and do not curl thy lip

still in the world can he restore thy fame
    because he lives and still expects long life
    if to itself grace call him not untimely

so said the master and in haste the other
    his hands extended and took up my guide
    hands whose great pressure hercules once felt

virgilius when he felt himself embraced
    said unto me draw nigh that i may take thee
    then of himself and me one bundle made

as seems the carisenda to behold
    beneath the leaning side when goes a cloud
    above it so that opposite it hangs

such did antaeus seem to me who stood
    watching to see him stoop and then it was
    i could have wished to go some other way

but lightly in the abyss which swallows up
    judas with lucifer he put us down
    nor thus bowed downward made he there delay

but as a mast does in a ship uprose







if i had rhymes both rough and stridulous
    as were appropriate to the dismal hole
    down upon which thrust all the other rocks

i would press out the juice of my conception
    more fully but because i have them not
    not without fear i bring myself to speak

for tis no enterprise to take in jest
    to sketch the bottom of all the universe
    nor for a tongue that cries mamma and babbo

but may those ladies help this verse of mine
    who helped amphion in enclosing thebes
    that from the fact the word be not diverse

o rabble illbegotten above all
    whore in the place to speak of which is hard
    twere better ye had here been sheep or goats

when we were down within the darksome well
    beneath the giants feet but lower far
    and i was scanning still the lofty wall

i heard it said to me look how thou steppest
    take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
    the heads of the tired miserable brothers

whereat i turned me round and saw before me
    and underfoot a lake that from the frost
    the semblance had of glass and not of water

so thick a veil neer made upon its current
    in wintertime danube in austria
    nor there beneath the frigid sky the don

as there was here so that if tambernich
    had fallen upon it or pietrapana
    een at the edge twould not have given a creak

and as to croak the frog doth place himself
    with muzzle out of waterwhen is dreaming
    of gleaning oftentimes the peasantgirl

livid as far down as where shame appears
    were the disconsolate shades within the ice
    setting their teeth unto the note of storks

each one his countenance held downward bent
    from mouth the cold from eyes the doleful heart
    among them witness of itself procures

when round about me somewhat i had looked
    i downward turned me and saw two so close
    the hair upon their heads together mingled

ye who so strain your breasts together tell me
    i said who are you and they bent their necks
    and when to me their faces they had lifted

their eyes which first were only moist within
    gushed oer the eyelids and the frost congealed
    the tears between and locked them up again

clamp never bound together wood with wood
    so strongly whereat they like two hegoats
    butted together so much wrath oercame them

and one who had by reason of the cold
    lost both his ears still with his visage downward
    said why dost thou so mirror thyself in us

if thou desire to know who these two are
    the valley whence bisenzio descends
    belonged to them and to their father albert

they from one body came and all caina
    thou shalt search through and shalt not find a shade
    more worthy to be fixed in gelatine

not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
    at one and the same blow by arthurs hand
    focaccia not not he who me encumbers

so with his head i see no farther forward
    and bore the name of sassol mascheroni
    well knowest thou who he was if thou art tuscan

and that thou put me not to further speech
    know that i camicion de pazzi was
    and wait carlino to exonerate me

then i beheld a thousand faces made
    purple with cold whence oer me comes a shudder
    and evermore will come at frozen ponds

and while we were advancing towrds the middle
    where everything of weight unites together
    and i was shivering in the eternal shade

whether twere will or destiny or chance
    i know not but in walking mong the heads
    i struck my foot hard in the face of one

weeping he growled why dost thou trample me
    unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
    of montaperti why dost thou molest me

and i my master now wait here for me
    that i through him may issue from a doubt
    then thou mayst hurry me as thou shalt wish

the leader stopped and to that one i said
    who was blaspheming vehemently still
    who art thou that thus reprehendest others

now who art thou that goest through antenora
    smiting replied he other peoples cheeks
    so that if thou wert living twere too much

living i am and dear to thee it may be
    was my response if thou demandest fame
    that mid the other notes thy name i place

and he to me for the reverse i long
    take thyself hence and give me no more trouble
    for ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow

then by the scalp behind i seized upon him
    and said it must needs be thou name thyself
    or not a hair remain upon thee here

whence he to me though thou strip off my hair
    i will not tell thee who i am nor show thee
    if on my head a thousand times thou fall

i had his hair in hand already twisted
    and more than one shock of it had pulled out
    he barking with his eyes held firmly down

when cried another what doth ail thee bocca
    ist not enough to clatter with thy jaws
    but thou must bark what devil touches thee

now said i i care not to have thee speak
    accursed traitor for unto thy shame
    i will report of thee veracious news

begone replied he and tell what thou wilt
    but be not silent if thou issue hence
    of him who had just now his tongue so prompt

he weepeth here the silver of the french
    i saw thus canst thou phrase it him of duera
    there where the sinners stand out in the cold

if thou shouldst questioned be who else was there
    thou hast beside thee him of beccaria
    of whom the gorget florence slit asunder

gianni del soldanier i think may be
    yonder with ganellon and tebaldello
    who oped faenza when the people slep

already we had gone away from him
    when i beheld two frozen in one hole
    so that one head a hood was to the other

and even as bread through hunger is devoured
    the uppermost on the other set his teeth
    there where the brain is to the nape united

not in another fashion tydeus gnawed
    the temples of menalippus in disdain
    than that one did the skull and the other things

o thou who showest by such bestial sign
    thy hatred against him whom thou art eating
    tell me the wherefore said i with this compact

that if thou rightfully of him complain
    in knowing who ye are and his transgression
    i in the world above repay thee for it

if that wherewith i speak be not dried up







his mouth uplifted from his grim repast
    that sinner wiping it upon the hair
    of the same head that he behind had wasted

then he began thou wilt that i renew
    the desperate grief which wrings my heart already
    to think of only ere i speak of it

but if my words be seed that may bear fruit
    of infamy to the traitor whom i gnaw
    speaking and weeping shalt thou see together

i know not who thou art nor by what mode
    thou hast come down here but a florentine
    thou seemest to me truly when i hear thee

thou hast to know i was count ugolino
    and this one was ruggieri the archbishop
    now i will tell thee why i am such a neighbour

that by effect of his malicious thoughts
    trusting in him i was made prisoner
    and after put to death i need not say

 but neertheless what thou canst not have heard
    that is to say how cruel was my death
    hear shalt thou and shalt know if he has wronged me

a narrow perforation in the mew
    which bears because of me the title of famine
    and in which others still must be locked up

had shown me through its opening many moons
    already when i dreamed the evil dream
    which of the future rent for me the veil

this one appeared to me as lord and master
    hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
    for which the pisans cannot lucca see

with sleuthhounds gaunt and eager and well trained
    gualandi with sismondi and lanfianchi
    he had sent out before him to the front

after brief course seemed unto me forespent
    the father and the sons and with sharp tushes
    it seemed to me i saw their flanks ripped open

when i before the morrow was awake
    moaning amid their sleep i heard my sons
    who with me were and asking after bread

cruel indeed art thou if yet thou grieve not
    thinking of what my heart foreboded me
    and weepst thou not what art thou wont to weep at

they were awake now and the hour drew nigh
    at which our food used to be brought to us
    and through his dream was each one apprehensive

and i heard locking up the under door
    of the horrible tower whereat without a word
    i gazed into the faces of my sons

i wept not i within so turned to stone
    they wept and darling little anselm mine
    said thou dost gaze so father what doth ail thee

still not a tear i shed nor answer made
    all of that day nor yet the night thereafter
    until another sun rose on the world

as now a little glimmer made its way
    into the dolorous prison and i saw
    upon four faces my own very aspect

both of my hands in agony i bit
    and thinking that i did it from desire
    of eating on a sudden they uprose

and said they father much less pain twill give us
    if thou do eat of us thyself didst clothe us
    with this poor flesh and do thou strip it off

i calmed me then not to make them more sad
    that day we all were silent and the next
    ah obdurate earth wherefore didst thou not open

when we had come unto the fourth day gaddo
    threw himself down outstretched before my feet
    saying my father why dost thou not help me

and there he died and as thou seest me
    i saw the three fall one by one between
    the fifth day and the sixth whence i betook me

already blind to groping over each
    and three days called them after they were dead
    then hunger did what sorrow could not do

when he had said this with his eyes distorted
    the wretched skull resumed he with his teeth
    which as a dogs upon the bone were strong

ah pisa thou opprobrium of the people
    of the fair land there where the si doth sound
    since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are

let the capraia and gorgona move
    and make a hedge across the mouth of arno
    that every person in thee it may drown

for if count ugolino had the fame
    of having in thy castles thee betrayed
    thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons

guiltless of any crime thou modern thebes
    their youth made uguccione and brigata
    and the other two my song doth name above

we passed still farther onward where the ice
    another people ruggedly enswathes
    not downward turned but all of them reversed

weeping itself there does not let them weep
    and grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
    turns itself inward to increase the anguish

because the earliest tears a cluster form
    and in the manner of a crystal visor
    fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full

and notwithstanding that as in a callus
    because of cold all sensibility
    its station had abandoned in my face

still it appeared to me i felt some wind
    whence i my master who sets this in motion
    is not below here every vapour quenched

whence he to me full soon shalt thou be where
    thine eye shall answer make to thee of this
    seeing the cause which raineth down the blast

and one of the wretches of the frozen crust
    cried out to us o souls so merciless
    that the last post is given unto you

lift from mine eyes the rigid veils that i
    may vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
    a little eer the weeping recongeal

whence i to him if thou wouldst have me help thee
    say who thou wast and if i free thee not
    may i go to the bottom of the ice

then he replied i am friar alberigo
    he am i of the fruit of the bad garden
    who here a date am getting for my fig

o said i to him now art thou too dead
    and he to me how may my body fare
    up in the world no knowledge i possess

such an advantage has this ptolomaea
    that oftentimes the soul descendeth here
    sooner than atropos in motion sets it

and that thou mayest more willingly remove
    from off my countenance these glassy tears
    know that as soon as any soul betrays

as i have done his body by a demon
    is taken from him who thereafter rules it
    until his time has wholly been revolved

itself down rushes into such a cistern
    and still perchance above appears the body
    of yonder shade that winters here behind me

this thou shouldst know if thou hast just come down
    it is ser branca d oria and many years
    have passed away since he was thus locked up

i think said i to him thou dost deceive me
    for branca d oria is not dead as yet
    and eats and drinks and sleeps and puts on clothes

in moat above said he of malebranche
    there where is boiling the tenacious pitch
    as yet had michel zanche not arrived

when this one left a devil in his stead
    in his own body and one near of kin
    who made together with him the betrayal

but hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith
    open mine eyesand open them i did not
    and to be rude to him was courtesy

ah genoese ye men at variance
    with every virtue full of every vice
    wherefore are ye not scattered from the world

for with the vilest spirit of romagna
    i found of you one such who for his deeds
    in soul already in cocytus bathes

and still above in body seems alive







vexilla regis prodeunt inferni
    towards us therefore look in front of thee
    my master said if thou discernest him

as when there breathes a heavy fog or when
    our hemisphere is darkening into night
    appears far off a mill the wind is turning

methought that such a building then i saw
    and for the wind i drew myself behind
    my guide because there was no other shelter

now was i and with fear in verse i put it
    there where the shades were wholly covered up
    and glimmered through like unto straws in glass

some prone are lying others stand erect
    this with the head and that one with the soles
    another bowlike face to feet inverts

when in advance so far we had proceeded
    that it my master pleased to show to me
    the creature who once had the beauteous semblance

he from before me moved and made me stop
    saying behold dis and behold the place
    where thou with fortitude must arm thyself

how frozen i became and powerless then
    ask it not reader for i write it not
    because all language would be insufficient

i did not die and i alive remained not
    think for thyself now hast thou aught of wit
    what i became being of both deprived

the emperor of the kingdom dolorous
    from his midbreast forth issued from the ice
    and better with a giant i compare

than do the giants with those arms of his
    consider now how great must be that whole
    which unto such a part conforms itself

were he as fair once as he now is foul
    and lifted up his brow against his maker
    well may proceed from him all tribulation

o what a marvel it appeared to me
    when i beheld three faces on his head
    the one in front and that vermilion was

two were the others that were joined with this
    above the middle part of either shoulder
    and they were joined together at the crest

and the righthand one seemed twixt white and yellow
    the left was such to look upon as those
    who come from where the nile falls valleyward

underneath each came forth two mighty wings
    such as befitting were so great a bird
    sails of the sea i never saw so large

 no feathers had they but as of a bat
    their fashion was and he was waving them
    so that three winds proceeded forth therefrom

thereby cocytus wholly was congealed
    with six eyes did he weep and down three chins
    trickled the teardrops and the bloody drivel

at every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
    a sinner in the manner of a brake
    so that he three of them tormented thus

to him in front the biting was as naught
    unto the clawing for sometimes the spine
    utterly stripped of all the skin remained

that soul up there which has the greatest pain
    the master said is judas iscariot
    with head inside he plies his legs without

of the two others who head downward are
    the one who hangs from the black jowl is brutus
    see how he writhes himself and speaks no word

and the other who so stalwart seems is cassius
    but night is reascending and tis time
    that we depart for we have seen the whole

as seemed him good i clasped him round the neck
    and he the vantage seized of time and place
    and when the wings were opened wide apart

he laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides
    from fell to fell descended downward then
    between the thick hair and the frozen crust

when we were come to where the thigh revolves
    exactly on the thickness of the haunch
    the guide with labour and with harddrawn breath

turned round his head where he had had his legs
    and grappled to the hair as one who mounts
    so that to hell i thought we were returning

keep fast thy hold for by such stairs as these
    the master said panting as one fatigued
    must we perforce depart from so much evil

then through the opening of a rock he issued
    and down upon the margin seated me
    then towrds me he outstretched his wary step

i lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
    lucifer in the same way i had left him
    and i beheld him upward hold his legs

and if i then became disquieted
    let stolid people think who do not see
    what the point is beyond which i had passed

rise up the master said upon thy feet
    the way is long and difficult the road
    and now the sun to middletierce returns

it was not any palace corridor
    there where we were but dungeon natural
    with floor uneven and unease of light

ere from the abyss i tear myself away
    my master said i when i had arisen
    to draw me from an error speak a little

where is the ice and how is this one fixed
    thus upside down and how in such short time
    from eve to morn has the sun made his transit

and he to me thou still imaginest
    thou art beyond the centre where i grasped
    the hair of the fell worm who mines the world

that side thou wast so long as i descended
    when round i turned me thou didst pass the point
    to which things heavy draw from every side

and now beneath the hemisphere art come
    opposite that which overhangs the vast
    dryland and neath whose cope was put to death

the man who without sin was born and lived
    thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
    which makes the other face of the judecca

here it is morn when it is evening there
    and he who with his hair a stairway made us
    still fixed remaineth as he was before

upon this side he fell down out of heaven
    and all the land that whilom here emerged
    for fear of him made of the sea a veil

and came to our hemisphere and peradventure
    to flee from him what on this side appears
    left the place vacant here and back recoiled

a place there is below from beelzebub
    as far receding as the tomb extends
    which not by sight is known but by the sound

of a small rivulet that there descendeth
    through chasm within the stone which it has gnawed
    with course that winds about and slightly falls

the guide and i into that hidden road
    now entered to return to the bright world
    and without care of having any rest

we mounted up he first and i the second
    till i beheld through a round aperture
    some of the beauteous things that heaven doth bear

thence we came forth to rebehold the stars






to run oer better waters hoists its sail
    the little vessel of my genius now
    that leaves behind itself a sea so cruel

and of that second kingdom will i sing
    wherein the human spirit doth purge itself
    and to ascend to heaven becometh worthy

but let dead poesy here rise again
    o holy muses since that i am yours
    and here calliope somewhat ascend

my song accompanying with that sound
    of which the miserable magpies felt
    the blow so great that they despaired of pardon

sweet colour of the oriental sapphire
    that was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
    of the pure air as far as the first circle

unto mine eyes did recommence delight
    soon as i issued forth from the dead air
    which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast

the beauteous planet that to love incites
    was making all the orient to laugh
    veiling the fishes that were in her escort

to the right hand i turned and fixed my mind
    upon the other pole and saw four stars
    neer seen before save by the primal people

rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven
    o thou septentrional and widowed site
    because thou art deprived of seeing these

when from regarding them i had withdrawn
    turning a little to the other pole
    there where the wain had disappeared already

i saw beside me an old man alone
    worthy of so much reverence in his look
    that more owes not to father any son

a long beard and with white hair intermingled
    he wore in semblance like unto the tresses
    of which a double list fell on his breast

the rays of the four consecrated stars
    did so adorn his countenance with light
    that him i saw as were the sun before him

who are you ye who counter the blind river
    have fled away from the eternal prison
    moving those venerable plumes he said

who guided you or who has been your lamp
    in issuing forth out of the night profound
    that ever black makes the infernal valley

the laws of the abyss are they thus broken
    or is there changed in heaven some council new
    that being damned ye come unto my crags

then did my leader lay his grasp upon me
    and with his words and with his hands and signs
    reverent he made in me my knees and brow

then answered him i came not of myself
    a lady from heaven descended at whose prayers
    i aided this one with my company

but since it is thy will more be unfolded
    of our condition how it truly is
    mine cannot be that this should be denied thee

this one has never his last evening seen
    but by his folly was so near to it
    that very little time was there to turn

as i have said i unto him was sent
    to rescue him and other way was none
    than this to which i have myself betaken

ive shown him all the people of perdition
    and now those spirits i intend to show
    who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship

how i have brought him would be long to tell thee
    virtue descendeth from on high that aids me
    to lead him to behold thee and to hear thee

now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming
    he seeketh liberty which is so dear
    as knoweth he who life for her refuses

thou knowst it since for her to thee not bitter
    was death in utica where thou didst leave
    the vesture that will shine so the great day

by us the eternal edicts are not broken
    since this one lives and minos binds not me
    but of that circle i where are the chaste

eyes of thy marcia who in looks still prays thee
    o holy breast to hold her as thine own
    for her love then incline thyself to us

permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go
    i will take back this grace from thee to her
    if to be mentioned there below thou deignest

marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes
    while i was on the other side then said he
    that every grace she wished of me i granted

now that she dwells beyond the evil river
    she can no longer move me by that law
    which when i issued forth from there was made

but if a lady of heaven do move and rule thee
    as thou dost say no flattery is needful
    let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me

go then and see thou gird this one about
    with a smooth rush and that thou wash his face
    so that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom

for twere not fitting that the eye oercast
    by any mist should go before the first
    angel who is of those of paradise

this little island round about its base
    below there yonder where the billow beats it
    doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze

no other plant that putteth forth the leaf
    or that doth indurate can there have life
    because it yieldeth not unto the shocks

thereafter be not this way your return
    the sun which now is rising will direct you
    to take the mount by easier ascent

with this he vanished and i raised me up
    without a word and wholly drew myself
    unto my guide and turned mine eyes to him

and he began son follow thou my steps
    let us turn back for on this side declines
    the plain unto its lower boundaries

the dawn was vanquishing the matin hour
    which fled before it so that from afar
    i recognised the trembling of the sea

along the solitary plain we went
    as one who unto the lost road returns
    and till he finds it seems to go in vain

as soon as we were come to where the dew
    fights with the sun and being in a part
    where shadow falls little evaporates

both of his hands upon the grass outspread
    in gentle manner did my master place
    whence i who of his action was aware

extended unto him my tearful cheeks
    there did he make in me uncovered wholly
    that hue which hell had covered up in me

then came we down upon the desert shore
    which never yet saw navigate its waters
    any that afterward had known return

there he begirt me as the other pleased
    o marvellous for even as he culled
    the humble plant such it sprang up again

suddenly there where he uprooted it







already had the sun the horizon reached
    whose circle of meridian covers oer
    jerusalem with its most lofty point

and night that opposite to him revolves
    was issuing forth from ganges with the scales
    that fall from out her hand when she exceedeth

so that the white and the vermilion cheeks
    of beautiful aurora where i was
    by too great age were changing into orange

we still were on the border of the sea
    like people who are thinking of their road
    who go in heart and with the body stay

and lo as when upon the approach of morning
    through the gross vapours mars grows fiery red
    down in the west upon the ocean floor

appeared to memay i again behold it
    a light along the sea so swiftly coming
    its motion by no flight of wing is equalled

from which when i a little had withdrawn
    mine eyes that i might question my conductor
    again i saw it brighter grown and larger

then on each side of it appeared to me
    i knew not what of white and underneath it
    little by little there came forth another

my master yet had uttered not a word
    while the first whiteness into wings unfolded
    but when he clearly recognised the pilot

he cried make haste make haste to bow the knee
    behold the angel of god fold thou thy hands
    henceforward shalt thou see such officers

see how he scorneth human arguments
    so that nor oar he wants nor other sail
    than his own wings between so distant shores

see how he holds them pointed up to heaven
    fanning the air with the eternal pinions
    that do not moult themselves like mortal hair

then as still nearer and more near us came
    the bird divine more radiant he appeared
    so that near by the eye could not endure him

but down i cast it and he came to shore
    with a small vessel very swift and light
    so that the water swallowed naught thereof

upon the stern stood the celestial pilot
    beatitude seemed written in his face
    and more than a hundred spirits sat within

in exitu israel de aegypto
    they chanted all together in one voice
    with whatso in that psalm is after written

then made he sign of holy rood upon them
    whereat all cast themselves upon the shore
    and he departed swiftly as he came

the throng which still remained there unfamiliar
    seemed with the place all round about them gazing
    as one who in new matters makes essay

on every side was darting forth the day
    the sun who had with his resplendent shafts
    from the midheaven chased forth the capricorn

when the new people lifted up their faces
    towards us saying to us if ye know
    show us the way to go unto the mountain

and answer made virgilius ye believe
    perchance that we have knowledge of this place
    but we are strangers even as yourselves

just now we came a little while before you
    another way which was so rough and steep
    that mounting will henceforth seem sport to us

the souls who had from seeing me draw breath
    become aware that i was still alive
    pallid in their astonishment became

and as to messenger who bears the olive
    the people throng to listen to the news
    and no one shows himself afraid of crowding

so at the sight of me stood motionless
    those fortunate spirits all of them as if
    oblivious to go and make them fair

one from among them saw i coming forward
    as to embrace me with such great affection
    that it incited me to do the like

o empty shadows save in aspect only
    three times behind it did i clasp my hands
    as oft returned with them to my own breast

i think with wonder i depicted me
    whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew
    and i pursuing it pressed farther forward

gently it said that i should stay my steps
    then knew i who it was and i entreated
    that it would stop awhile to speak with me

it made reply to me even as i loved thee
    in mortal body so i love thee free
    therefore i stop but wherefore goest thou

my own casella to return once more
    there where i am i make this journey said i
    but how from thee has so much time be taken

and he to me no outrage has been done me
    if he who takes both when and whom he pleases
    has many times denied to me this passage

for of a righteous will his own is made
    he sooth to say for three months past has taken
    whoever wished to enter with all peace

whence i who now had turned unto that shore
    where salt the waters of the tiber grow
    benignantly by him have been received

unto that outlet now his wing is pointed
    because for evermore assemble there
    those who towrds acheron do not descend

and i if some new law take not from thee
    memory or practice of the song of love
    which used to quiet in me all my longings

thee may it please to comfort therewithal
    somewhat this soul of mine that with its body
    hitherward coming is so much distressed

love that within my mind discourses with me
    forthwith began he so melodiously
    the melody within me still is sounding

my master and myself and all that people
    which with him were appeared as satisfied
    as if naught else might touch the mind of any

we all of us were moveless and attentive
    unto his notes and lo the grave old man
    exclaiming what is this ye laggard spirits

what negligence what standing still is this
    run to the mountain to strip off the slough
    that lets not god be manifest to you

even as when collecting grain or tares
    the doves together at their pasture met
    quiet nor showing their accustomed pride

if aught appear of which they are afraid
    upon a sudden leave their food alone
    because they are assailed by greater care

so that fresh company did i behold
    the song relinquish and go towrds the hill
    as one who goes and knows not whitherward

nor was our own departure less in haste







inasmuch as the instantaneous flight
    had scattered them asunder oer the plain
    turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us

i pressed me close unto my faithful comrade
    and how without him had i kept my course
    who would have led me up along the mountain

he seemed to me within himself remorseful
    o noble conscience and without a stain
    how sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee

after his feet had laid aside the haste
    which mars the dignity of every act
    my mind that hitherto had been restrained

let loose its faculties as if delighted
    and i my sight directed to the hill
    that highest towrds the heaven uplifts itself

the sun that in our rear was flaming red
    was broken in front of me into the figure
    which had in me the stoppage of its rays

unto one side i turned me with the fear
    of being left alone when i beheld
    only in front of me the ground obscured

why dost thou still mistrust my comforter
    began to say to me turned wholly round
    dost thou not think me with thee and that i guide thee

tis evening there already where is buried
    the body within which i cast a shadow
    tis from brundusium taen and naples has it

now if in front of me no shadow fall
    marvel not at it more than at the heavens
    because one ray impedeth not another

to suffer torments both of cold and heat
    bodies like this that power provides which wills
    that how it works be not unveiled to us

insane is he who hopeth that our reason
    can traverse the illimitable way
    which the one substance in three persons follows

mortals remain contented at the quia
    for if ye had been able to see all
    no need there were for mary to give birth

and ye have seen desiring without fruit
    those whose desire would have been quieted
    which evermore is given them for a grief

i speak of aristotle and of plato
    and many othersand here bowed his head
    and more he said not and remained disturbed

we came meanwhile unto the mountains foot
    there so precipitate we found the rock
    that nimble legs would there have been in vain

twixt lerici and turbia the most desert
    the most secluded pathway is a stair
    easy and open if compared with that

who knoweth now upon which hand the hill
    slopes down my master said his footsteps staying
    so that who goeth without wings may mount

and while he held his eyes upon the ground
    examining the nature of the path
    and i was looking up around the rock

on the left hand appeared to me a throng
    of souls that moved their feet in our direction
    and did not seem to move they came so slowly

lift up thine eyes i to the master said
    behold on this side who will give us counsel
    if thou of thine own self can have it not

then he looked at me and with frank expression
    replied let us go there for they come slowly
    and thou be steadfast in thy hope sweet son

still was that people as far off from us
    after a thousand steps of ours i say
    as a good thrower with his hand would reach

when they all crowded unto the hard masses
    of the high bank and motionless stood and close
    as he stands still to look who goes in doubt

o happy dead  o spirits elect already
    virgilius made beginning by that peace
    which i believe is waiting for you all

tell us upon what side the mountain slopes
    so that the going up be possible
    for to lose time irks him most who most knows

as sheep come issuing forth from out the fold
    by ones and twos and threes and the others stand
    timidly holding down their eyes and nostrils

and what the foremost does the others do
    huddling themselves against her if she stop
    simple and quiet and the wherefore know not

so moving to approach us thereupon
    i saw the leader of that fortunate flock
    modest in face and dignified in gait

as soon as those in the advance saw broken
    the light upon the ground at my right side
    so that from me the shadow reached the rock

they stopped and backward drew themselves somewhat
    and all the others who came after them
    not knowing why nor wherefore did the same

without your asking i confess to you
    this is a human body which you see
    whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft

marvel ye not thereat but be persuaded
    that not without a power which comes from heaven
    doth he endeavour to surmount this wall

the master thus and said those worthy people
    return ye then and enter in before us
    making a signal with the back o the hand

and one of them began whoeer thou art
    thus going turn thine eyes consider well
    if eer thou saw me in the other world

i turned me towrds him and looked at him closely
    blond was he beautiful and of noble aspect
    but one of his eyebrows had a blow divided

when with humility i had disclaimed
    eer having seen him now behold he said
    and showed me high upon his breast a wound

then said he with a smile i am manfredi
    the grandson of the empress costanza
    therefore when thou returnest i beseech thee

go to my daughter beautiful the mother
    of sicilys honour and of aragons
    and the truth tell her if aught else be told

after i had my body lacerated
    by these two mortal stabs i gave myself
    weeping to him who willingly doth pardon

horrible my iniquities had been
    but infinite goodness hath such ample arms
    that it receives whatever turns to it

had but cosenzas pastor who in chase
    of me was sent by clement at that time
    in god read understandingly this page

the bones of my dead body still would be
    at the bridgehead near unto benevento
    under the safeguard of the heavy cairn

now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind
    beyond the realm almost beside the verde
    where he transported them with tapers quenched

by malison of theirs is not so lost
    eternal love that it cannot return
    so long as hope has anything of green

true is it who in contumacy dies
    of holy church though penitent at last
    must wait upon the outside this bank

thirty times told the time that he has been
    in his presumption unless such decree
    shorter by means of righteous prayers become

see now if thou hast power to make me happy
    by making known unto my good costanza
    how thou hast seen me and this ban beside

for those on earth can much advance us here







whenever by delight or else by pain
    that seizes any faculty of ours
    wholly to that the soul collects itself

it seemeth that no other power it heeds
    and this against that error is which thinks
    one soul above another kindles in us

and hence whenever aught is heard or seen
    which keeps the soul intently bent upon it
    time passes on and we perceive it not

because one faculty is that which listens
    and other that which the soul keeps entire
    this is as if in bonds and that is free

of this i had experience positive
    in hearing and in gazing at that spirit
    for fifty full degrees uprisen was

the sun and i had not perceived it when
    we came to where those souls with one accord
    cried out unto us here is what you ask

a greater opening ofttimes hedges up
    with but a little forkful of his thorns
    the villager what time the grape imbrowns

than was the passageway through which ascended
    only my leader and myself behind him
    after that company departed from us

one climbs sanleo and descends in noli
    and mounts the summit of bismantova
    with feet alone but here one needs must fly

with the swift pinions and the plumes i say
    of great desire conducted after him
    who gave me hope and made a light for me

we mounted upward through the rifted rock
    and on each side the border pressed upon us
    and feet and hands the ground beneath required

when we were come upon the upper rim
    of the high bank out on the open slope
    my master said i what way shall we take

and he to me no step of thine descend
    still up the mount behind me win thy way
    till some sage escort shall appear to us

the summit was so high it vanquished sight
    and the hillside precipitous far more
    than line from middle quadrant to the centre

spent with fatigue was i when i began
    o my sweet father turn thee and behold
    how i remain alone unless thou stay

o son he said up yonder drag thyself
    pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher
    which on that side encircles all the hill

these words of his so spurred me on that i
    strained every nerve behind him scrambling up
    until the circle was beneath my feet

thereon ourselves we seated both of us
    turned to the east from which we had ascended
    for all men are delighted to look back

to the low shores mine eyes i first directed
    then to the sun uplifted them and wondered
    that on the left hand we were smitten by it

the poet well perceived that i was wholly
    bewildered at the chariot of the light
    where twixt us and the aquilon it entered

whereon he said to me if castor and pollux
    were in the company of yonder mirror
    that up and down conducteth with its light

thou wouldst behold the zodiacs jagged wheel
    revolving still more near unto the bears
    unless it swerved aside from its old track

how that may be wouldst thou have power to think
    collected in thyself imagine zion
    together with this mount on earth to stand

so that they both one sole horizon have
    and hemispheres diverse whereby the road
    which phaeton alas knew not to drive

thoult see how of necessity must pass
    this on one side when that upon the other
    if thine intelligence right clearly heed

truly my master said i never yet
    saw i so clearly as i now discern
    there where my wit appeared incompetent

that the midcircle of supernal motion
    which in some art is the equator called
    and aye remains between the sun and winter

for reason which thou sayest departeth hence
    towrds the septentrion what time the hebrews
    beheld it towrds the region of the heat

but if it pleaseth thee i fain would learn
    how far we have to go for the hill rises
    higher than eyes of mine have power to rise

and he to me this mount is such that ever
    at the beginning down below tis tiresome
    and aye the more one climbs the less it hurts

therefore when it shall seem so pleasant to thee
    that going up shall be to thee as easy
    as going down the current in a boat

then at this pathways ending thou wilt be
    there to repose thy panting breath expect
    no more i answer and this i know for true

and as he finished uttering these words
    a voice close by us sounded peradventure
    thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that

at sound thereof each one of us turned round
    and saw upon the left hand a great rock
    which neither i nor he before had noticed

thither we drew and there were persons there
    who in the shadow stood behind the rock
    as one through indolence is wont to stand

and one of them who seemed to me fatigued
    was sitting down and both his knees embraced
    holding his face low down between them bowed

o my sweet lord i said do turn thine eye
    on him who shows himself more negligent
    then even sloth herself his sister were

then he turned round to us and he gave heed
    just lifting up his eyes above his thigh
    and said now go thou up for thou art valiant

then knew i who he was and the distress
    that still a little did my breathing quicken
    my going to him hindered not and after

i came to him he hardly raised his head
    saying hast thou seen clearly how the sun
    oer thy left shoulder drives his chariot

his sluggish attitude and his curt words
    a little unto laughter moved my lips
    then i began belacqua i grieve not

for thee henceforth but tell me wherefore seated
    in this place art thou  waitest thou an escort
    or has thy usual habit seized upon thee

and he o brother whats the use of climbing
    since to my torment would not let me go
    the angel of god who sitteth at the gate

first heaven must needs so long revolve me round
    outside thereof as in my life it did
    since the good sighs i to the end postponed

unless eer that some prayer may bring me aid
    which rises from a heart that lives in grace
    what profit others that in heaven are heard not

meanwhile the poet was before me mounting
    and saying come now see the sun has touched
    meridian and from the shore the night

covers already with her foot morocco







i had already from those shades departed
    and followed in the footsteps of my guide
    when from behind pointing his finger at me

one shouted see it seems as if shone not
    the sunshine on the left of him below
    and like one living seems he to conduct him

mine eyes i turned at utterance of these words
    and saw them watching with astonishment
    but me but me and the light which was broken

why doth thy mind so occupy itself
    the master said that thou thy pace dost slacken
    what matters it to thee what here is whispered

come after me and let the people talk
    stand like a steadfast tower that never wags
    its top for all the blowing of the winds

for evermore the man in whom is springing
    thought upon thought removes from him the mark
    because the force of one the other weakens

what could i say in answer but i come
    i said it somewhat with that colour tinged
    which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy

meanwhile along the mountainside across
    came people in advance of us a little
    singing the miserere verse by verse

when they became aware i gave no place
    for passage of the sunshine through my body
    they changed their song into a long hoarse oh

and two of them in form of messengers
    ran forth to meet us and demanded of us
    of your condition make us cognisant

and said my master ye can go your way
    and carry back again to those who sent you
    that this ones body is of very flesh

if they stood still because they saw his shadow
    as i suppose enough is answered them
    him let them honour it may profit them

vapours enkindled saw i neer so swiftly
    at early nightfall cleave the air serene
    nor at the set of sun the clouds of august

but upward they returned in briefer time
    and on arriving with the others wheeled
    towrds us like troops that run without a rein

this folk that presses unto us is great
    and cometh to implore thee said the poet
    so still go onward and in going listen

o soul that goest to beatitude
    with the same members wherewith thou wast born
    shouting they came a little stay thy steps

look if thou eer hast any of us seen
    so that oer yonder thou bear news of him
    ah why dost thou go on  ah why not stay

long since we all were slain by violence
    and sinners even to the latest hour
    then did a light from heaven admonish us

so that both penitent and pardoning forth
    from life we issued reconciled to god
    who with desire to see him stirs our hearts

and i although i gaze into your faces
    no one i recognize but if may please you
    aught i have power to do ye wellborn spirits

speak ye and i will do it by that peace
    which following the feet of such a guide
    from world to world makes itself sought by me

and one began each one has confidence
    in thy good offices without an oath
    unless the i cannot cut off the i will

whence i who speak alone before the others
    pray thee if ever thou dost see the land
    that twixt romagna lies and that of charles

thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers
    in fano that they pray for me devoutly
    that i may purge away my grave offences

from thence was i but the deep wounds through which
    issued the blood wherein i had my seat
    were dealt me in bosom of the antenori

there where i thought to be the most secure
    twas he of este had it done who held me
    in hatred far beyond what justice willed

but if towards the mira i had fled
    when i was overtaken at oriaco
    i still should be oer yonder where men breathe

i ran to the lagoon and reeds and mire
    did so entangle me i fell and saw there
    a lake made from my veins upon the ground

then said another ah be that desire
    fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain
    as thou with pious pity aidest mine

i was of montefeltro and am buonconte
    giovanna nor none other cares for me
    hence among these i go with downcast front

and i to him what violence or what chance
    led thee astray so far from campaldino
    that never has thy sepulture been known

oh he replied at casentinos foot
    a river crosses named archiano born
    above the hermitage in apennine

there where the name thereof becometh void
    did i arrive pierced through and through the throat
    fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain

there my sight lost i and my utterance
    ceased in the name of mary and thereat
    i fell and tenantless my flesh remained

truth will i speak repeat it to the living
    gods angel took me up and he of hell
    shouted o thou from heaven why dost thou rob me

thou bearest away the eternal part of him
    for one poor little tear that takes him from me
    but with the rest ill deal in other fashion

well knowest thou how in the air is gathered
    that humid vapour which to water turns
    soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it

he joined that evil will which aye seeks evil
    to intellect and moved the mist and wind
    by means of power which his own nature gave

thereafter when the day was spent the valley
    from pratomagno to the great yoke covered
    with fog and made the heaven above intent

so that the pregnant air to water changed
    down fell the rain and to the gullies came
    whateer of it earth tolerated not

and as it mingled with the mighty torrents
    towards the royal river with such speed
    it headlong rushed that nothing held it back

my frozen body near unto its outlet
    the robust archian found and into arno
    thrust it and loosened from my breast the cross

i made of me when agony oercame me
    it rolled me on the banks and on the bottom
    then with its booty covered and begirt me

ah when thou hast returned unto the world
    and rested thee from thy long journeying
    after the second followed the third spirit

do thou remember me who am the pia
    siena made me unmade me maremma
    he knoweth it who had encircled first

espousing me my finger with his gem







wheneer is broken up the game of zara
    he who has lost remains behind despondent
    the throws repeating and in sadness learns

the people with the other all depart
    one goes in front and one behind doth pluck him
    and at his side one brings himself to mind

he pauses not and this and that one hears
    they crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches
    and from the throng he thus defends himself

even such was i in that dense multitude
    turning to them this way and that my face
    and promising i freed myself therefrom

there was the aretine who from the arms
    untamed of ghin di tacco had his death
    and he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned

there was imploring with his hands outstretched
    frederick novello and that one of pisa
    who made the good marzucco seem so strong

i saw count orso and the soul divided
    by hatred and by envy from its body
    as it declared and not for crime committed

pierre de la brosse i say and here provide
    while still on earth the lady of brabant
    so that for this she be of no worse flock

as soon as i was free from all those shades
    who only prayed that some one else may pray
    so as to hasten their becoming holy

began i it appears that thou deniest
    o light of mine expressly in some text
    that orison can bend decree of heaven

and neertheless these people pray for this
    might then their expectation bootless be
    or is to me thy saying not quite clear

and he to me my writing is explicit
    and not fallacious is the hope of these
    if with sane intellect tis well regarded

for top of judgment doth not vail itself
    because the fire of love fulfils at once
    what he must satisfy who here installs him

and there where i affirmed that proposition
    defect was not amended by a prayer
    because the prayer from god was separate

verily in so deep a questioning
    do not decide unless she tell it thee
    who light twixt truth and intellect shall be

i know not if thou understand i speak
    of beatrice her shalt thou see above
    smiling and happy on this mountains top

and i good leader let us make more haste
    for i no longer tire me as before
    and see een now the hill a shadow casts

we will go forward with this day he answered
    as far as now is possible for us
    but otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest

ere thou art up there thou shalt see return
    him who now hides himself behind the hill
    so that thou dost not interrupt his rays

but yonder there behold a soul that stationed
    all all alone is looking hitherward
    it will point out to us the quickest way

we came up unto it o lombard soul
    how lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee
    and grand and slow in moving of thine eyes

nothing whatever did it say to us
    but let us go our way eying us only
    after the manner of a couchant lion

still near to it virgilius drew entreating
    that it would point us out the best ascent
    and it replied not unto his demand

but of our native land and of our life
    it questioned us and the sweet guide began
    mantuaand the shade all in itself recluse

rose towrds him from the place where first it was
    saying o mantuan i am sordello
    of thine own land and one embraced the other

ah servile italy griefs hostelry
    a ship without a pilot in great tempest
    no lady thou of provinces but brothel

that noble soul was so impatient only
    at the sweet sound of his own native land
    to make its citizen glad welcome there

and now within thee are not without war
    thy living ones and one doth gnaw the other
    of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in

search wretched one all round about the shores
    thy seaboard and then look within thy bosom
    if any part of thee enjoyeth peace

what boots it that for thee justinian
    the bridle mend if empty be the saddle
    withouten this the shame would be the less

ah people thou that oughtest to be devout
    and to let caesar sit upon the saddle
    if well thou hearest what god teacheth thee

behold how fell this wild beast has become
    being no longer by the spur corrected
    since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle

o german albert who abandonest
    her that has grown recalcitrant and savage
    and oughtest to bestride her saddlebow

may a just judgment from the stars down fall
    upon thy blood and be it new and open
    that thy successor may have fear thereof

because thy father and thyself have suffered
    by greed of those transalpine lands distrained
    the garden of the empire to be waste

come and behold montecchi and cappelletti
    monaldi and fillippeschi careless man
    those sad already and these doubtdepressed

come cruel one come and behold the oppression
    of thy nobility and cure their wounds
    and thou shalt see how safe is santafiore

come and behold thy rome that is lamenting
    widowed alone and day and night exclaims
    my caesar why hast thou forsaken me

come and behold how loving are the people
    and if for us no pity moveth thee
    come and be made ashamed of thy renown

and if it lawful be o jove supreme
    who upon earth for us wast crucified
    are thy just eyes averted otherwhere

or preparation is t that in the abyss
    of thine own counsel for some good thou makest
    from our perception utterly cut off

for all the towns of italy are full
    of tyrants and becometh a marcellus
    each peasant churl who plays the partisan

my florence well mayst thou contented be
    with this digression which concerns thee not
    thanks to thy people who such forethought take

many at heart have justice but shoot slowly
    that unadvised they come not to the bow
    but on their very lips thy people have it

many refuse to bear the common burden
    but thy solicitous people answereth
    without being asked and crieth i submit

now be thou joyful for thou hast good reason
    thou affluent thou in peace thou full of wisdom
    if i speak true the event conceals it not

athens and lacedaemon they who made
    the ancient laws and were so civilized
    made towards living well a little sign

compared with thee who makest such finespun
    provisions that to middle of november
    reaches not what thou in october spinnest

how oft within the time of thy remembrance
    laws money offices and usages
    hast thou remodelled and renewed thy members

and if thou mind thee well and see the light
    thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman
    who cannot find repose upon her down

but by her tossing wardeth off her pain






after the gracious and glad salutations
    had three and four times been reiterated
    sordello backward drew and said who are you

or ever to this mountain were directed
    the souls deserving to ascend to god
    my bones were buried by octavian

i am virgilius and for no crime else
    did i lose heaven than for not having faith
    in this wise then my leader made reply

as one who suddenly before him sees
    something whereat he marvels who believes
    and yet does not saying it is it is not

so he appeared and then bowed down his brow
    and with humility returned towards him
    and where inferiors embrace embraced him

o glory of the latians thou he said
    through whom our language showed what it could do
    o pride eternal of the place i came from

what merit or what grace to me reveals thee
    if i to hear thy words be worthy tell me
    if thou dost come from hell and from what cloister

through all the circles of the doleful realm
    responded he have i come hitherward
    heavens power impelled me and with that i come

i by not doing not by doing lost
    the sight of that high sun which thou desirest
    and which too late by me was recognized

a place there is below not sad with torments
    but darkness only where the lamentations
    have not the sound of wailing but are sighs

there dwell i with the little innocents
    snatched by the teeth of death or ever they
    were from our human sinfulness exempt

there dwell i among those who the three saintly
    virtues did not put on and without vice
    the others knew and followed all of them

but if thou know and can some indication
    give us by which we may the sooner come
    where purgatory has its right beginning

he answered no fixed place has been assigned us
    tis lawful for me to go up and round
    so far as i can go as guide i join thee

but see already how the day declines
    and to go up by night we are not able
    therefore tis well to think of some fair sojourn

souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn
    if thou permit me i will lead thee to them
    and thou shalt know them not without delight

how is this was the answer should one wish
    to mount by night would he prevented be
    by others or mayhap would not have power

and on the ground the good sordello drew
    his finger saying see this line alone
    thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone

not that aught else would hindrance give however
    to going up save the nocturnal darkness
    this with the want of power the will perplexes

we might indeed therewith return below
    and wandering walk the hillside round about
    while the horizon holds the day imprisoned

thereon my lord as if in wonder said
    do thou conduct us thither where thou sayest
    that we can take delight in tarrying

little had we withdrawn us from that place
    when i perceived the mount was hollowed out
    in fashion as the valleys here are hollowed

thitherward said that shade will we repair
    where of itself the hillside makes a lap
    and there for the new day will we await

twixt hill and plain there was a winding path
    which led us to the margin of that dell
    where dies the border more than half away

gold and fine silver and scarlet and pearlwhite
    the indian wood resplendent and serene
    fresh emerald the moment it is broken

by herbage and by flowers within that hollow
    planted each one in colour would be vanquished
    as by its greater vanquished is the less

nor in that place had nature painted only
    but of the sweetness of a thousand odours
    made there a mingled fragrance and unknown

salve regina on the green and flowers
    there seated singing spirits i beheld
    which were not visible outside the valley

before the scanty sun now seeks his nest
    began the mantuan who had led us thither
    among them do not wish me to conduct you

better from off this ledge the acts and faces
    of all of them will you discriminate
    than in the plain below received among them

he who sits highest and the semblance bears
    of having what he should have done neglected
    and to the others song moves not his lips

rudolph the emperor was who had the power
    to heal the wounds that italy have slain
    so that through others slowly she revives

the other who in look doth comfort him
    governed the region where the water springs
    the moldau bears the elbe and elbe the sea

his name was ottocar and in swaddlingclothes
    far better he than bearded winceslaus
    his son who feeds in luxury and ease

and the smallnosed who close in council seems
    with him that has an aspect so benign
    died fleeing and disflowering the lily

look there how he is beating at his breast
    behold the other one who for his cheek
    sighing has made of his own palm a bed

father and fatherinlaw of frances pest
    are they and know his vicious life and lewd
    and hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them

he who appears so stalwart and chimes in
    singing with that one of the manly nose
    the cord of every valour wore begirt

and if as king had after him remained
    the stripling who in rear of him is sitting
    well had the valour passed from vase to vase

which cannot of the other heirs be said
    frederick and jacomo possess the realms
    but none the better heritage possesses

not oftentimes upriseth through the branches
    the probity of man and this he wills
    who gives it so that we may ask of him

eke to the largenosed reach my words no less
    than to the other pier who with him sings
    whence provence and apulia grieve already

the plant is as inferior to its seed
    as more than beatrice and margaret
    costanza boasteth of her husband still

behold the monarch of the simple life
    harry of england sitting there alone
    he in his branches has a better issue

he who the lowest on the ground among them
    sits looking upward is the marquis william
    for whose sake alessandria and her war

make monferrat and canavese weep







twas now the hour that turneth back desire
    in those who sail the sea and melts the heart
    the day theyve said to their sweet friends farewell

and the new pilgrim penetrates with love
    if he doth hear from far away a bell
    that seemeth to deplore the dying day

when i began to make of no avail
    my hearing and to watch one of the souls
    uprisen that begged attention with its hand

it joined and lifted upward both its palms
    fixing its eyes upon the orient
    as if it said to god naught else i care for

te lucis ante so devoutly issued
    forth from its mouth and with such dulcet notes
    it made me issue forth from my own mind

and then the others sweetly and devoutly
    accompanied it through all the hymn entire
    having their eyes on the supernal wheels

here reader fix thine eyes well on the truth
    for now indeed so subtile is the veil
    surely to penetrate within is easy

i saw that army of the gentleborn
    thereafterward in silence upward gaze
    as if in expectation pale and humble

and from on high come forth and down descend
    i saw two angels with two flaming swords
    truncated and deprived of their points

green as the little leaflets just now born
    their garments were which by their verdant pinions
    beaten and blown abroad they trailed behind

one just above us came to take his station
    and one descended to the opposite bank
    so that the people were contained between them

clearly in them discerned i the blond head
    but in their faces was the eye bewildered
    as faculty confounded by excess

from marys bosom both of them have come
    sordello said as guardians of the valley
    against the serpent that will come anon

whereupon i who knew not by what road
    turned round about and closely drew myself
    utterly frozen to the faithful shoulders

and once again sordello now descend we
    mid the grand shades and we will speak to them
    right pleasant will it be for them to see you

only three steps i think that i descended
    and was below and saw one who was looking
    only at me as if he fain would know me

already now the air was growing dark
    but not so that between his eyes and mine
    it did not show what it before locked up

towrds me he moved and i towrds him did move
    noble judge nino how it me delighted
    when i beheld thee not among the damned

no greeting fair was left unsaid between us
    then asked he how long is it since thou camest
    oer the far waters to the mountains foot

oh said i to him through the dismal places
    i came this morn and am in the first life
    albeit the other going thus i gain

and on the instant my reply was heard
    he and sordello both shrank back from me
    like people who are suddenly bewildered

one to virgilius and the other turned
    to one who sat there crying up currado
    come and behold what god in grace has willed

then turned to me by that especial grace
    thou owest unto him who so conceals
    his own first wherefore that it has no ford

when thou shalt be beyond the waters wide
    tell my giovanna that she pray for me
    where answer to the innocent is made

i do not think her mother loves me more
    since she has laid aside her wimple white
    which she unhappy needs must wish again

through her full easily is comprehended
    how long in woman lasts the fire of love
    if eye or touch do not relight it often

so fair a hatchment will not make for her
    the viper marshalling the milanese
    afield as would have made galluras cock

in this wise spake he with the stamp impressed
    upon his aspect of that righteous zeal
    which measurably burneth in the heart

my greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven
    still to that point where slowest are the stars
    even as a wheel the nearest to its axle

and my conductor son what dost thou gaze at
    up there  and i to him at those three torches
    with which this hither pole is all on fire

and he to me the four resplendent stars
    thou sawest this morning are down yonder low
    and these have mounted up to where those were

as he was speaking to himself sordello
    drew him and said lo there our adversary
    and pointed with his finger to look thither

upon the side on which the little valley
    no barrier hath a serpent was perchance
    the same which gave to eve the bitter food

twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak
    turning at times its head about and licking
    its back like to a beast that smoothes itself

i did not see and therefore cannot say
    how the celestial falcons gan to move
    but well i saw that they were both in motion

hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings
    the serpent fled and round the angels wheeled
    up to their stations flying back alike

the shade that to the judge had near approached
    when he had called throughout that whole assault
    had not a moment loosed its gaze on me

so may the light that leadeth thee on high
    find in thine own freewill as much of wax
    as needful is up to the highest azure

began it if some true intelligence
    of valdimagra or its neighbourhood
    thou knowest tell it me who once was great there

currado malaspina was i called
    im not the elder but from him descended
    to mine i bore the love which here refineth

o said i unto him through your domains
    i never passed but where is there a dwelling
    throughout all europe where they are not known

that fame which doeth honour to your house
    proclaims its signors and proclaims its land
    so that he knows of them who neer was there

and as i hope for heaven i swear to you
    your honoured family in naught abates
    the glory of the purse and of the sword

it is so privileged by use and nature
    that though a guilty head misguide the world
    sole it goes right and scorns the evil way

and he now go for the sun shall not lie
    seven times upon the pillow which the ram
    with all his four feet covers and bestrides

before that such a courteous opinion
    shall in the middle of thy head be nailed
    with greater nails than of anothers speech

unless the course of justice standeth still







the concubine of old tithonus now
    gleamed white upon the eastern balcony
    forth from the arms of her sweet paramour

with gems her forehead all relucent was
    set in the shape of that cold animal
    which with its tail doth smite amain the nations

and of the steps with which she mounts the night
    had taken two in that place where we were
    and now the third was bending down its wings

when i who something had of adam in me
    vanquished by sleep upon the grass reclined
    there were all five of us already sat

just at the hour when her sad lay begins
    the little swallow near unto the morning
    perchance in memory of her former woes

and when the mind of man a wanderer
    more from the flesh and less by thought imprisoned
    almost prophetic in its visions is

in dreams it seemed to me i saw suspended
    an eagle in the sky with plumes of gold
    with wings wide open and intent to stoop

and this it seemed to me was where had been
    by ganymede his kith and kin abandoned
    when to the high consistory he was rapt

i thought within myself perchance he strikes
    from habit only here and from elsewhere
    disdains to bear up any in his feet

then wheeling somewhat more it seemed to me
    terrible as the lightning he descended
    and snatched me upward even to the fire

therein it seemed that he and i were burning
    and the imagined fire did scorch me so
    that of necessity my sleep was broken

not otherwise achilles started up
    around him turning his awakened eyes
    and knowing not the place in which he was

what time from chiron stealthily his mother
    carried him sleeping in her arms to scyros
    wherefrom the greeks withdrew him afterwards

than i upstarted when from off my face
    sleep fled away and pallid i became
    as doth the man who freezes with affright

only my comforter was at my side
    and now the sun was more than two hours high
    and turned towards the seashore was my face

be not intimidated said my lord
    be reassured for all is well with us
    do not restrain but put forth all thy strength

thou hast at length arrived at purgatory
    see there the cliff that closes it around
    see there the entrance where it seems disjoined

whilom at dawn which doth precede the day
    when inwardly thy spirit was asleep
    upon the flowers that deck the land below

there came a lady and said i am lucia
    let me take this one up who is asleep
    so will i make his journey easier for him

sordello and the other noble shapes
    remained she took thee and as day grew bright
    upward she came and i upon her footsteps

she laid thee here and first her beauteous eyes
    that open entrance pointed out to me
    then she and sleep together went away

in guise of one whose doubts are reassured
    and who to confidence his fear doth change
    after the truth has been discovered to him

so did i change and when without disquiet
    my leader saw me up along the cliff
    he moved and i behind him towrd the height

reader thou seest well how i exalt
    my theme and therefore if with greater art
    i fortify it marvel not thereat

nearer approached we and were in such place
    that there where first appeared to me a rift
    like to a crevice that disparts a wall

i saw a portal and three stairs beneath
    diverse in colour to go up to it
    and a gatekeeper who yet spake no word

and as i opened more and more mine eyes
    i saw him seated on the highest stair
    such in the face that i endured it not

and in his hand he had a naked sword
    which so reflected back the sunbeams towrds us
    that oft in vain i lifted up mine eyes

tell it from where you are what ist you wish
    began he to exclaim where is the escort
    take heed your coming hither harm you not

a lady of heaven with these things conversant
    my master answered him but even now
    said to us thither go there is the portal

and may she speed your footsteps in all good
    again began the courteous janitor
    come forward then unto these stairs of ours

thither did we approach and the first stair
    was marble white so polished and so smooth
    i mirrored myself therein as i appear

the second tinct of deeper hue than perse
    was of a calcined and uneven stone
    cracked all asunder lengthwise and across

the third that uppermost rests massively
    porphyry seemed to me as flaming red
    as blood that from a vein is spirting forth

both of his feet was holding upon this
    the angel of god upon the threshold seated
    which seemed to me a stone of diamond

along the three stairs upward with good will
    did my conductor draw me saying ask
    humbly that he the fastening may undo

devoutly at the holy feet i cast me
    for mercys sake besought that he would open
    but first upon my breast three times i smote

seven ps upon my forehead he described
    with the swords point and take heed that thou wash
    these wounds when thou shalt be within he said

ashes or earth that dry is excavated
    of the same colour were with his attire
    and from beneath it he drew forth two keys

one was of gold and the other was of silver
    first with the white and after with the yellow
    plied he the door so that i was content

whenever faileth either of these keys
    so that it turn not rightly in the lock
    he said to us this entrance doth not open

more precious one is but the other needs
    more art and intellect ere it unlock
    for it is that which doth the knot unloose

from peter i have them and he bade me err
    rather in opening than in keeping shut
    if people but fall down before my feet

then pushed the portals of the sacred door
    exclaiming enter but i give you warning
    that forth returns whoever looks behind

and when upon their hinges were turned round
    the swivels of that consecrated gate
    which are of metal massive and sonorous

roared not so loud nor so discordant seemed
    tarpeia when was taen from it the good
    metellus wherefore meagre it remained

at the first thunderpeal i turned attentive
    and te deum laudamus seemed to hear
    in voices mingled with sweet melody

exactly such an image rendered me
    that which i heard as we are wont to catch
    when people singing with the organ stand

for now we hear and now hear not the words







when we had crossed the threshold of the door
    which the perverted love of souls disuses
    because it makes the crooked way seem straight

reechoing i heard it closed again
    and if i had turned back mine eyes upon it
    what for my failing had been fit excuse

we mounted upward through a rifted rock
    which undulated to this side and that
    even as a wave receding and advancing

here it behoves us use a little art
    began my leader to adapt ourselves
    now here now there to the receding side

and this our footsteps so infrequent made
    that sooner had the moons decreasing disk
    regained its bed to sink again to rest

than we were forth from out that needles eye
    but when we free and in the open were
    there where the mountain backward piles itself

i wearied out and both of us uncertain
    about our way we stopped upon a plain
    more desolate than roads across the deserts

from where its margin borders on the void
    to foot of the high bank that ever rises
    a human body three times told would measure

and far as eye of mine could wing its flight
    now on the left and on the right flank now
    the same this cornice did appear to me

thereon our feet had not been moved as yet
    when i perceived the embankment round about
    which all right of ascent had interdicted

to be of marble white and so adorned
    with sculptures that not only polycletus
    but natures self had there been put to shame

the angel who came down to earth with tidings
    of peace that had been wept for many a year
    and opened heaven from its long interdict

in front of us appeared so truthfully
    there sculptured in a gracious attitude
    he did not seem an image that is silent

one would have sworn that he was saying ave
    for she was there in effigy portrayed
    who turned the key to ope the exalted love

and in her mien this language had impressed
    ecce ancilla dei as distinctly
    as any figure stamps itself in wax

keep not thy mind upon one place alone
    the gentle master said who had me standing
    upon that side where people have their hearts

whereat i moved mine eyes and i beheld
    in rear of mary and upon that side
    where he was standing who conducted me

another story on the rock imposed
    wherefore i passed virgilius and drew near
    so that before mine eyes it might be set

there sculptured in the selfsame marble were
    the cart and oxen drawing the holy ark
    wherefore one dreads an office not appointed

people appeared in front and all of them
    in seven choirs divided of two senses
    made one say no the other yes they sing

likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense
    which there was imaged forth the eyes and nose
    were in the yes and no discordant made

preceded there the vessel benedight
    dancing with girded loins the humble psalmist
    and more and less than king was he in this

opposite represented at the window
    of a great palace michal looked upon him
    even as a woman scornful and afflicted

i moved my feet from where i had been standing
    to examine near at hand another story
    which after michal glimmered white upon me

there the high glory of the roman prince
    was chronicled whose great beneficence
    moved gregory to his great victory

tis of the emperor trajan i am speaking
    and a poor widow at his bridle stood
    in attitude of weeping and of grief

around about him seemed it thronged and full
    of cavaliers and the eagles in the gold
    above them visibly in the wind were moving

the wretched woman in the midst of these
    seemed to be saying give me vengeance lord
    for my dead son for whom my heart is breaking

and he to answer her now wait until
    i shall return  and she my lord like one
    in whom grief is impatient shouldst thou not

return  and he who shall be where i am
    will give it thee  and she good deed of others
    what boots it thee if thou neglect thine own

whence he now comfort thee for it behoves me
    that i discharge my duty ere i move
    justice so wills and pity doth retain me

he who on no new thing has ever looked
    was the creator of this visible language
    novel to us for here it is not found

while i delighted me in contemplating
    the images of such humility
    and dear to look on for their makers sake

behold upon this side but rare they make
    their steps the poet murmured many people
    these will direct us to the lofty stairs

mine eyes that in beholding were intent
    to see new things of which they curious are
    in turning round towards him were not slow

but still i wish not reader thou shouldst swerve
    from thy good purposes because thou hearest
    how god ordaineth that the debt be paid

attend not to the fashion of the torment
    think of what follows think that at the worst
    it cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence

master began i that which i behold
    moving towards us seems to me not persons
    and what i know not so in sight i waver

and he to me the grievous quality
    of this their torment bows them so to earth
    that my own eyes at first contended with it

but look there fixedly and disentangle
    by sight what cometh underneath those stones
    already canst thou see how each is stricken

o ye proud christians wretched weary ones
    who in the vision of the mind infirm
    confidence have in your backsliding steps

do ye not comprehend that we are worms
    born to bring forth the angelic butterfly
    that flieth unto judgment without screen

why floats aloft your spirit high in air
    like are ye unto insects undeveloped
    even as the worm in whom formation fails

as to sustain a ceiling or a roof
    in place of corbel oftentimes a figure
    is seen to join its knees unto its breast

which makes of the unreal real anguish
    arise in him who sees it fashioned thus
    beheld i those when i had taen good heed

true is it they were more or less bent down
    according as they more or less were laden
    and he who had most patience in his looks

weeping did seem to say i can no more






our father thou who dwellest in the heavens
    not circumscribed but from the greater love
    thou bearest to the first effects on high

praised be thy name and thine omnipotence
    by every creature as befitting is
    to render thanks to thy sweet effluence

come unto us the peace of thy dominion
    for unto it we cannot of ourselves
    if it come not with all our intellect

even as thine own angels of their will
    make sacrifice to thee hosanna singing
    so may all men make sacrifice of theirs

give unto us this day our daily manna
    withouten which in this rough wilderness
    backward goes he who toils most to advance

and even as we the trespass we have suffered
    pardon in one another pardon thou
    benignly and regard not our desert

our virtue which is easily oercome
    put not to proof with the old adversary
    but thou from him who spurs it so deliver

this last petition verily dear lord
    not for ourselves is made who need it not
    but for their sake who have remained behind us

thus for themselves and us good furtherance
    those shades imploring went beneath a weight
    like unto that of which we sometimes dream

unequally in anguish round and round
    and weary all upon that foremost cornice
    purging away the smokestains of the world

if there good words are always said for us
    what may not here be said and done for them
    by those who have a good root to their will

well may we help them wash away the marks
    that hence they carried so that clean and light
    they may ascend unto the starry wheels

ah so may pity and justice you disburden
    soon that ye may have power to move the wing
    that shall uplift you after your desire

show us on which hand towrd the stairs the way
    is shortest and if more than one the passes
    point us out that which least abruptly falls

for he who cometh with me through the burden
    of adams flesh wherewith he is invested
    against his will is chary of his climbing

the words of theirs which they returned to those
    that he whom i was following had spoken
    it was not manifest from whom they came

but it was said to the right hand come with us
    along the bank and ye shall find a pass
    possible for living person to ascend

and were i not impeded by the stone
    which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate
    whence i am forced to hold my visage down

him who still lives and does not name himself
    would i regard to see if i may know him
    and make him piteous unto this burden

a latian was i and born of a great tuscan
    guglielmo aldobrandeschi was my father
    i know not if his name were ever with you

the ancient blood and deeds of gallantry
    of my progenitors so arrogant made me
    that thinking not upon the common mother

all men i held in scorn to such extent
    i died therefor as know the sienese
    and every child in campagnatico

i am omberto and not to me alone
    has pride done harm but all my kith and kin
    has with it dragged into adversity

and here must i this burden bear for it
    till god be satisfied since i did not
    among the living here among the dead

listening i downward bent my countenance
    and one of them not this one who was speaking
    twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him

and looked at me and knew me and called out
    keeping his eyes laboriously fixed
    on me who all bowed down was going with them

o asked i him art thou not oderisi
    agobbios honour and honour of that art
    which is in paris called illuminating

brother said he more laughing are the leaves
    touched by the brush of franco bolognese
    all his the honour now and mine in part

in sooth i had not been so courteous
    while i was living for the great desire
    of excellence on which my heart was bent

here of such pride is paid the forfeiture
    and yet i should not be here were it not
    that having power to sin i turned to god

o thou vain glory of the human powers
    how little green upon thy summit lingers
    ift be not followed by an age of grossness

in painting cimabue thought that he
    should hold the field now giotto has the cry
    so that the others fame is growing dim

so has one guido from the other taken
    the glory of our tongue and he perchance
    is born who from the nest shall chase them both

naught is this mundane rumour but a breath
    of wind that comes now this way and now that
    and changes name because it changes side

what fame shalt thou have more if old peel off
    from thee thy flesh than if thou hadst been dead
    before thou left the pappo and the dindi

ere pass a thousand years which is a shorter
    space to the eterne than twinkling of an eye
    unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest

with him who takes so little of the road
    in front of me all tuscany resounded
    and now he scarce is lisped of in siena

where he was lord what time was overthrown
    the florentine delirium that superb
    was at that day as now tis prostitute

your reputation is the colour of grass
    which comes and goes and that discolours it
    by which it issues green from out the earth

and i thy true speech fills my heart with good
    humility and great tumour thou assuagest
    but who is he of whom just now thou spakest

that he replied is provenzan salvani
    and he is here because he had presumed
    to bring siena all into his hands

he has gone thus and goeth without rest
    eer since he died such money renders back
    in payment he who is on earth too daring

and i if every spirit who awaits
    the verge of life before that he repent
    remains below there and ascends not hither


    until as much time as he lived be passed
    how was the coming granted him in largess

when he in greatest splendour lived said he
    freely upon the campo of siena
    all shame being laid aside he placed himself

and there to draw his friend from the duress
    which in the prisonhouse of charles he suffered
    he brought himself to tremble in each vein

i say no more and know that i speak darkly
    yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours
    will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it

this action has released him from those confines







abreast like oxen going in a yoke
    i with that heavyladen soul went on
    as long as the sweet pedagogue permitted

but when he said leave him and onward pass
    for here tis good that with the sail and oars
    as much as may be each push on his barque

upright as walking wills it i redressed
    my person notwithstanding that my thoughts
    remained within me downcast and abashed

i had moved on and followed willingly
    the footsteps of my master and we both
    already showed how light of foot we were

when unto me he said cast down thine eyes
    twere well for thee to alleviate the way
    to look upon the bed beneath thy feet

as that some memory may exist of them
    above the buried dead their tombs in earth
    bear sculptured on them what they were before

whence often there we weep for them afresh
    from pricking of remembrance which alone
    to the compassionate doth set its spur

so saw i there but of a better semblance
    in point of artifice with figures covered
    whateer as pathway from the mount projects

i saw that one who was created noble
    more than all other creatures down from heaven
    flaming with lightnings fall upon one side

i saw briareus smitten by the dart
    celestial lying on the other side
    heavy upon the earth by mortal frost

i saw thymbraeus pallas saw and mars
    still clad in armour round about their father
    gaze at the scattered members of the giants

i saw at foot of his great labour nimrod
    as if bewildered looking at the people
    who had been proud with him in sennaar

o niobe with what afflicted eyes
    thee i beheld upon the pathway traced
    between thy seven and seven children slain

o saul how fallen upon thy proper sword
    didst thou appear there lifeless in gilboa
    that felt thereafter neither rain nor dew

o mad arachne so i thee beheld
    een then half spider sad upon the shreds
    of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee

o rehoboam no more seems to threaten
    thine image there but full of consternation
    a chariot bears it off when none pursues

displayed moreoer the adamantine pavement
    how unto his own mother made alcmaeon
    costly appear the luckless ornament

displayed how his own sons did throw themselves
    upon sennacherib within the temple
    and how he being dead they left him there

displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage
    that tomyris wrought when she to cyrus said
    blood didst thou thirst for and with blood i glut thee

displayed how routed fled the assyrians
    after that holofernes had been slain
    and likewise the remainder of that slaughter

i saw there troy in ashes and in caverns
    o ilion thee how abject and debased
    displayed the image that is there discerned

whoeer of pencil master was or stile
    that could portray the shades and traits which there
    would cause each subtile genius to admire

dead seemed the dead the living seemed alive
    better than i saw not who saw the truth
    all that i trod upon while bowed i went

now wax ye proud and on with looks uplifted
    ye sons of eve and bow not down your faces
    so that ye may behold your evil ways

more of the mount by us was now encompassed
    and far more spent the circuit of the sun
    than had the mind preoccupied imagined

when he who ever watchful in advance
    was going on began lift up thy head
    tis no more time to go thus meditating

lo there an angel who is making haste
    to come towards us lo returning is
    from service of the day the sixth handmaiden

with reverence thine acts and looks adorn
    so that he may delight to speed us upward
    think that this day will never dawn again

i was familiar with his admonition
    ever to lose no time so on this theme
    he could not unto me speak covertly

towards us came the being beautiful
    vested in white and in his countenance
    such as appears the tremulous morning star

his arms he opened and opened then his wings
    come said he near at hand here are the steps
    and easy from henceforth is the ascent

at this announcement few are they who come
    o human creatures born to soar aloft
    why fall ye thus before a little wind

he led us on to where the rock was cleft
    there smote upon my forehead with his wings
    then a safe passage promised unto me

as on the right hand to ascend the mount
    where seated is the church that lordeth it
    oer the wellguided above rubaconte

the bold abruptness of the ascent is broken
    by stairways that were made there in the age
    when still were safe the ledger and the stave

een thus attempered is the bank which falls
    sheer downward from the second circle there
    but on this side and that the high rock graze

as we were turning thitherward our persons
    beati pauperes spiritu voices
    sang in such wise that speech could tell it not

ah me how different are these entrances
    from the infernal for with anthems here
    one enters and below with wild laments

we now were hunting up the sacred stairs
    and it appeared to me by far more easy
    than on the plain it had appeared before

whence i my master say what heavy thing
    has been uplifted from me so that hardly
    aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking

he answered when the ps which have remained
    still on thy face almost obliterate
    shall wholly as the first is be erased

thy feet will be so vanquished by good will
    that not alone they shall not feel fatigue
    but urging up will be to them delight

then did i even as they do who are going
    with something on the head to them unknown
    unless the signs of others make them doubt

wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful
    and seeks and finds and doth fulfill the office
    which cannot be accomplished by the sight

and with the fingers of the right hand spread
    i found but six the letters that had carved
    upon my temples he who bore the keys

upon beholding which my leader smiled







we were upon the summit of the stairs
    where for the second time is cut away
    the mountain which ascending shriveth all

there in like manner doth a cornice bind
    the hill all round about as does the first
    save that its arc more suddenly is curved

shade is there none nor sculpture that appears
    so seems the bank and so the road seems smooth
    with but the livid colour of the stone

if to inquire we wait for people here
    the poet said i fear that peradventure
    too much delay will our election have

then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed
    made his right side the centre of his motion
    and turned the left part of himself about

o thou sweet light with trust in whom i enter
    upon this novel journey do thou lead us
    said he as one within here should be led

thou warmest the world thou shinest over it
    if other reason prompt not otherwise
    thy rays should evermore our leaders be

as much as here is counted for a mile
    so much already there had we advanced
    in little time by dint of ready will

and towrds us there were heard to fly albeit
    they were not visible spirits uttering
    unto loves table courteous invitations

the first voice that passed onward in its flight
    vinum non habent said in accents loud
    and went reiterating it behind us

and ere it wholly grew inaudible
    because of distance passed another crying
    i am orestes and it also stayed not

o said i father these what voices are they
    and even as i asked behold the third
    saying love those from whom ye have had evil

and the good master said this circle scourges
    the sin of envy and on that account
    are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge

the bridle of another sound shall be
    i think that thou wilt hear it as i judge
    before thou comest to the pass of pardon

but fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast
    and people thou wilt see before us sitting
    and each one close against the cliff is seated

then wider than at first mine eyes i opened
    i looked before me and saw shades with mantles
    not from the colour of the stone diverse

and when we were a little farther onward
    i heard a cry of mary pray for us
    a cry of michael peter and all saints

i do not think there walketh still on earth
    a man so hard that he would not be pierced
    with pity at what afterward i saw

for when i had approached so near to them
    that manifest to me their acts became
    drained was i at the eyes by heavy grief

covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me
    and one sustained the other with his shoulder
    and all of them were by the bank sustained

thus do the blind in want of livelihood
    stand at the doors of churches asking alms
    and one upon another leans his head

so that in others pity soon may rise
    not only at the accent of their words
    but at their aspect which no less implores

and as unto the blind the sun comes not
    so to the shades of whom just now i spake
    heavens light will not be bounteous of itself

for all their lids an iron wire transpierces
    and sews them up as to a sparhawk wild
    is done because it will not quiet stay

to me it seemed in passing to do outrage
    seeing the others without being seen
    wherefore i turned me to my counsel sage

well knew he what the mute one wished to say
    and therefore waited not for my demand
    but said speak and be brief and to the point

i had virgilius upon that side
    of the embankment from which one may fall
    since by no border tis engarlanded

upon the other side of me i had
    the shades devout who through the horrible seam
    pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks

to them i turned me and o people certain
    began i of beholding the high light
    which your desire has solely in its care

so may grace speedily dissolve the scum
    upon your consciences that limpidly
    through them descend the river of the mind

tell me for dear twill be to me and gracious
    if any soul among you here is latian
    and twill perchance be good for him i learn it

o brother mine each one is citizen
    of one true city but thy meaning is
    who may have lived in italy a pilgrim

by way of answer this i seemed to hear
    a little farther on than where i stood
    whereat i made myself still nearer heard

among the rest i saw a shade that waited
    in aspect and should any one ask how
    its chin it lifted upward like a blind man

spirit i said who stoopest to ascend
    if thou art he who did reply to me
    make thyself known to me by place or name

sienese was i it replied and with
    the others here recleanse my guilty life
    weeping to him to lend himself to us

sapient i was not although i sapia
    was called and i was at anothers harm
    more happy far than at my own good fortune

and that thou mayst not think that i deceive thee
    hear if i was as foolish as i tell thee
    the arc already of my years descending

my fellowcitizens near unto colle
    were joined in battle with their adversaries
    and i was praying god for what he willed

routed were they and turned into the bitter
    passes of flight and i the chase beholding
    a joy received unequalled by all others

so that i lifted upward my bold face
    crying to god henceforth i fear thee not
    as did the blackbird at the little sunshine

peace i desired with god at the extreme
    of my existence and as yet would not
    my debt have been by penitence discharged

had it not been that in remembrance held me
    pier pettignano in his holy prayers
    who out of charity was grieved for me

but who art thou that into our conditions
    questioning goest and hast thine eyes unbound
    as i believe and breathing dost discourse

mine eyes i said will yet be here taen from me
    but for short space for small is the offence
    committed by their being turned with envy

far greater is the fear wherein suspended
    my soul is of the torment underneath
    for even now the load down there weighs on me

and she to me who led thee then among us
    up here if to return below thou thinkest
    and i he who is with me and speaks not

and living am i therefore ask of me
    spirit elect if thou wouldst have me move
    oer yonder yet my mortal feet for thee

o this is such a novel thing to hear
    she answered that great sign it is god loves thee
    therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me

and i implore by what thou most desirest
    if eer thou treadest the soil of tuscany
    well with my kindred reinstate my fame

them wilt thou see among that people vain
    who hope in talamone and will lose there
    more hope than in discovering the diana

but there still more the admirals will lose







who is this one that goes about our mountain
    or ever death has given him power of flight
    and opes his eyes and shuts them at his will

i know not who but know hes not alone
    ask him thyself for thou art nearer to him
    and gently so that he may speak accost him

thus did two spirits leaning towrds each other
    discourse about me there on the right hand
    then held supine their faces to address me

and said the one o soul that fastened still
    within the body towrds the heaven art going
    for charity console us and declare

whence comest and who art thou for thou makst us
    as much to marvel at this grace of thine
    as must a thing that never yet has been

and i through midst of tuscany there wanders
    a streamlet that is born in falterona
    and not a hundred miles of course suffice it

from thereupon do i this body bring
    to tell you who i am were speech in vain
    because my name as yet makes no great noise

if well thy meaning i can penetrate
    with intellect of mine then answered me
    he who first spake thou speakest of the arno

and said the other to him why concealed
    this one the appellation of that river
    even as a man doth of things horrible

and thus the shade that questioned was of this
    himself acquitted i know not but truly
    tis fit the name of such a valley perish

for from its fountainhead 

to where it yields itself in restoration
    of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up
    whence have the rivers that which goes with them

virtue is like an enemy avoided
    by all as is a serpent through misfortune
    of place or through bad habit that impels them

on which account have so transformed their nature
    the dwellers in that miserable valley
    it seems that circe had them in her pasture

mid ugly swine of acorns worthier
    than other food for human use created
    it first directeth its impoverished way

curs findeth it thereafter coming downward
    more snarling than their puissance demands
    and turns from them disdainfully its muzzle

it goes on falling and the more it grows
    the more it finds the dogs becoming wolves
    this maledict and misadventurous ditch

descended then through many a hollow gulf
    it finds the foxes so replete with fraud
    they fear no cunning that may master them

nor will i cease because another hears me
    and well twill be for him if still he mind him
    of what a truthful spirit to me unravels

thy grandson i behold who doth become
    a hunter of those wolves upon the bank
    of the wild stream and terrifies them all

he sells their flesh it being yet alive
    thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves
    many of life himself of praise deprives

bloodstained he issues from the dismal forest
    he leaves it such a thousand years from now
    in its primeval state tis not rewooded

as at the announcement of impending ills
    the face of him who listens is disturbed
    from whateer side the peril seize upon him

so i beheld that other soul which stood
    turned round to listen grow disturbed and sad
    when it had gathered to itself the word

the speech of one and aspect of the other
    had me desirous made to know their names
    and question mixed with prayers i made thereof

whereat the spirit which first spake to me
    began again thou wishest i should bring me
    to do for thee what thoult not do for me

but since god willeth that in thee shine forth
    such grace of his ill not be chary with thee
    know then that i guido del duca am

my blood was so with envy set on fire
    that if i had beheld a man make merry
    thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled oer with pallor

from my own sowing such the straw i reap
    o human race why dost thou set thy heart
    where interdict of partnership must be

this is renier this is the boast and honour
    of the house of calboli where no one since
    has made himself the heir of his desert

and not alone his blood is made devoid
    twixt po and mount and seashore and the reno
    of good required for truth and for diversion

for all within these boundaries is full
    of venomous roots so that too tardily
    by cultivation now would they diminish

where is good lizio and arrigo manardi
    pier traversaro and guido di carpigna
    o romagnuoli into bastards turned

when in bologna will a fabbro rise
    when in faenza a bernardin di fosco
    the noble scion of ignoble seed

be not astonished tuscan if i weep
    when i remember with guido da prata
    ugolin d azzo who was living with us

frederick tignoso and his company
    the house of traversara and th anastagi
    and one race and the other is extinct

the dames and cavaliers the toils and ease
    that filled our souls with love and courtesy
    there where the hearts have so malicious grown

o brettinoro why dost thou not flee
    seeing that all thy family is gone
    and many people not to be corrupted

bagnacaval does well in not begetting
    and ill does castrocaro and conio worse
    in taking trouble to beget such counts

will do well the pagani when their devil
    shall have departed but not therefore pure
    will testimony of them eer remain

o ugolin de fantoli secure
    thy name is since no longer is awaited
    one who degenerating can obscure it

but go now tuscan for it now delights me
    to weep far better than it does to speak
    so much has our discourse my mind distressed

we were aware that those beloved souls
    heard us depart therefore by keeping silent
    they made us of our pathway confident

when we became alone by going onward
    thunder when it doth cleave the air appeared
    a voice that counter to us came exclaiming

shall slay me whosoever findeth me
    and fled as the reverberation dies
    if suddenly the cloud asunder bursts

as soon as hearing had a truce from this
    behold another with so great a crash
    that it resembled thunderings following fast

i am aglaurus who became a stone
    and then to press myself close to the poet
    i backward and not forward took a step

already on all sides the air was quiet
    and said he to me that was the hard curb
    that ought to hold a man within his bounds

but you take in the bait so that the hook
    of the old adversary draws you to him
    and hence availeth little curb or call

the heavens are calling you and wheel around you
    displaying to you their eternal beauties
    and still your eye is looking on the ground

whence he who all discerns chastises you







as much as twixt the close of the third hour
    and dawn of day appeareth of that sphere
    which aye in fashion of a child is playing

so much it now appeared towards the night
    was of his course remaining to the sun
    there it was evening and twas midnight here

and the rays smote the middle of our faces
    because by us the mount was so encircled
    that straight towards the west we now were going

when i perceived my forehead overpowered
    beneath the splendour far more than at first
    and stupor were to me the things unknown

whereat towards the summit of my brow
    i raised my hands and made myself the visor
    which the excessive glare diminishes

as when from off the water or a mirror
    the sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side
    ascending upward in the selfsame measure

that it descends and deviates as far
    from falling of a stone in line direct
    

so it appeared to me that by a light
    refracted there before me i was smitten
    on which account my sight was swift to flee

what is that father sweet from which i cannot
    so fully screen my sight that it avail me
    said i and seems towards us to be moving

marvel thou not if dazzle thee as yet
    the family of heaven he answered me
    an angel tis who comes to invite us upward

soon will it be that to behold these things
    shall not be grievous but delightful to thee
    as much as nature fashioned thee to feel

when we had reached the angel benedight
    with joyful voice he said here enter in
    to stairway far less steep than are the others

we mounting were already thence departed
    and beati misericordes was
    behind us sung rejoice thou that oercomest

my master and myself we two alone
    were going upward and i thought in going
    some profit to acquire from words of his

and i to him directed me thus asking
    what did the spirit of romagna mean
    mentioning interdict and partnership

whence he to me of his own greatest failing
    he knows the harm and therefore wonder not
    if he reprove us that we less may rue it

because are thither pointed your desires
    where by companionship each share is lessened
    envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs

but if the love of the supernal sphere
    should upwardly direct your aspiration
    there would not be that fear within your breast

for there as much the more as one says our
    so much the more of good each one possesses
    and more of charity in that cloister burns

i am more hungering to be satisfied
    i said than if i had before been silent
    and more of doubt within my mind i gather

how can it be that boon distributed
    the more possessors can more wealthy make
    therein than if by few it be possessed

and he to me because thou fixest still
    thy mind entirely upon earthly things
    thou pluckest darkness from the very light

that goodness infinite and ineffable
    which is above there runneth unto love
    as to a lucid body comes the sunbeam

so much it gives itself as it finds ardour
    so that as far as charity extends
    oer it increases the eternal valour

and the more people thitherward aspire
    more are there to love well and more they love there
    and as a mirror one reflects the other

and if my reasoning appease thee not
    thou shalt see beatrice and she will fully
    take from thee this and every other longing

endeavour then that soon may be extinct
    as are the two already the five wounds
    that close themselves again by being painful

even as i wished to say thou dost appease me
    i saw that i had reached another circle
    so that my eager eyes made me keep silence

there it appeared to me that in a vision
    ecstatic on a sudden i was rapt
    and in a temple many persons saw

and at the door a woman with the sweet
    behaviour of a mother saying son
    why in this manner hast thou dealt with us

lo sorrowing thy father and myself
    were seeking for theeand as here she ceased
    that which appeared at first had disappeared

then i beheld another with those waters
    adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever
    from great disdain of others it is born

and saying if of that city thou art lord
    for whose name was such strife among the gods
    and whence doth every science scintillate

avenge thyself on those audacious arms
    that clasped our daughter o pisistratus
    and the lord seemed to me benign and mild

to answer her with aspect temperate
    what shall we do to those who wish us ill
    if he who loves us be by us condemned

then saw i people hot in fire of wrath
    with stones a young man slaying clamorously
    still crying to each other kill him kill him

and him i saw bow down because of death
    that weighed already on him to the earth
    but of his eyes made ever gates to heaven

imploring the high lord in so great strife
    that he would pardon those his persecutors
    with such an aspect as unlocks compassion

soon as my soul had outwardly returned
    to things external to it which are true
    did i my not false errors recognize

my leader who could see me bear myself
    like to a man that rouses him from sleep
    exclaimed what ails thee that thou canst not stand

but hast been coming more than half a league
    veiling thine eyes and with thy legs entangled
    in guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues

o my sweet father if thou listen to me
    ill tell thee said i what appeared to me
    when thus from me my legs were taen away

and he if thou shouldst have a hundred masks
    upon thy face from me would not be shut
    thy cogitations howsoever small

what thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail
    to ope thy heart unto the waters of peace
    which from the eternal fountain are diffused

i did not ask what ails thee as he does
    who only looketh with the eyes that see not
    when of the soul bereft the body lies

but asked it to give vigour to thy feet
    thus must we needs urge on the sluggards slow
    to use their wakefulness when it returns

we passed along athwart the twilight peering
    forward as far as ever eye could stretch
    against the sunbeams serotine and lucent

and lo by slow degrees a smoke approached
    in our direction sombre as the night
    nor was there place to hide ones self therefrom

this of our eyes and the pure air bereft us







darkness of hell and of a night deprived
    of every planet under a poor sky
    as much as may be tenebrous with cloud

neer made unto my sight so thick a veil
    as did that smoke which there enveloped us
    nor to the feeling of so rough a texture

for not an eye it suffered to stay open
    whereat mine escort faithful and sagacious
    drew near to me and offered me his shoulder

een as a blind man goes behind his guide
    lest he should wander or should strike against
    aught that may harm or peradventure kill him

so went i through the bitter and foul air
    listening unto my leader who said only
    look that from me thou be not separated

voices i heard and every one appeared
    to supplicate for peace and misericord
    the lamb of god who takes away our sins

still agnus dei their exordium was
    one word there was in all and metre one
    so that all harmony appeared among them

master i said are spirits those i hear
    and he to me thou apprehendest truly
    and they the knot of anger go unloosing

now who art thou that cleavest through our smoke
    and art discoursing of us even as though
    thou didst by calends still divide the time

after this manner by a voice was spoken
    whereon my master said do thou reply
    and ask if on this side the way go upward

and i o creature that dost cleanse thyself
    to return beautiful to him who made thee
    thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me

thee will i follow far as is allowed me
    he answered and if smoke prevent our seeing
    hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof

thereon began i with that swathing band
    which death unwindeth am i going upward
    and hither came i through the infernal anguish

and if god in his grace has me infolded
    so that he wills that i behold his court
    by method wholly out of modern usage

conceal not from me who ere death thou wast
    but tell it me and tell me if i go
    right for the pass and be thy words our escort

lombard was i and i was marco called
    the world i knew and loved that excellence
    at which has each one now unbent his bow

for mounting upward thou art going right
    thus he made answer and subjoined i pray thee
    to pray for me when thou shalt be above

and i to him my faith i pledge to thee
    to do what thou dost ask me but am bursting
    inly with doubt unless i rid me of it

first it was simple and is now made double
    by thy opinion which makes certain to me
    here and elsewhere that which i couple with it

the world forsooth is utterly deserted
    by every virtue as thou tellest me
    and with iniquity is big and covered

but i beseech thee point me out the cause
    that i may see it and to others show it
    for one in the heavens and here below one puts it

a sigh profound that grief forced into ai
    he first sent forth and then began he brother
    the world is blind and sooth thou comest from it

ye who are living every cause refer
    still upward to the heavens as if all things
    they of necessity moved with themselves

if this were so in you would be destroyed
    free will nor any justice would there be
    in having joy for good or grief for evil

the heavens your movements do initiate
    i say not all but granting that i say it
    light has been given you for good and evil

and free volition which if some fatigue
    in the first battles with the heavens it suffers
    afterwards conquers all if well tis nurtured

to greater force and to a better nature
    though free ye subject are and that creates
    the mind in you the heavens have not in charge

hence if the present world doth go astray
    in you the cause is be it sought in you
    and i therein will now be thy true spy

forth from the hand of him who fondles it
    before it is like to a little girl
    weeping and laughing in her childish sport

issues the simple soul that nothing knows
    save that proceeding from a joyous maker
    gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure

of trivial good at first it tastes the savour
    is cheated by it and runs after it
    if guide or rein turn not aside its love

hence it behoved laws for a rein to place
    behoved a king to have who at the least
    of the true city should discern the tower

the laws exist but who sets hand to them
    no one because the shepherd who precedes
    can ruminate but cleaveth not the hoof

wherefore the people that perceives its guide
    strike only at the good for which it hankers
    feeds upon that and farther seeketh not

clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance
    the cause is that has made the world depraved
    and not that nature is corrupt in you

rome that reformed the world accustomed was
    two suns to have which one road and the other
    of god and of the world made manifest

one has the other quenched and to the crosier
    the sword is joined and ill beseemeth it
    that by main force one with the other go

because being joined one feareth not the other
    if thou believe not think upon the grain
    for by its seed each herb is recognized

in the land laved by po and adige
    valour and courtesy used to be found
    before that frederick had his controversy

now in security can pass that way
    whoever will abstain through sense of shame
    from speaking with the good or drawing near them

true three old men are left in whom upbraids
    the ancient age the new and late they deem it
    that god restore them to the better life

currado da palazzo and good gherardo
    and guido da castel who better named is
    in fashion of the french the simple lombard

say thou henceforward that the church of rome
    confounding in itself two governments
    falls in the mire and soils itself and burden

o marco mine i said thou reasonest well
    and now discern i why the sons of levi
    have been excluded from the heritage

but what gherardo is it who as sample
    of a lost race thou sayest has remained
    in reprobation of the barbarous age

either thy speech deceives me or it tempts me
    he answered me for speaking tuscan to me
    it seems of good gherardo naught thou knowest

by other surname do i know him not
    unless i take it from his daughter gaia
    may god be with you for i come no farther

behold the dawn that through the smoke rays out
    already whitening and i must depart
    yonder the angel isere he appear

thus did he speak and would no farther hear me







remember reader if eer in the alps
    a mist oertook thee through which thou couldst see
    not otherwise than through its membrane mole

how when the vapours humid and condensed
    begin to dissipate themselves the sphere
    of the sun feebly enters in among them

and thy imagination will be swift
    in coming to perceive how i resaw
    the sun at first that was already setting

thus to the faithful footsteps of my master
    mating mine own i issued from that cloud
    to rays already dead on the low shores

o thou imagination that dost steal us
    so from without sometimes that man perceives not
    although around may sound a thousand trumpets

who moveth thee if sense impel thee not
    moves thee a light which in the heaven takes form
    by self or by a will that downward guides it

of her impiety who changed her form
    into the bird that most delights in singing
    in my imagining appeared the trace

and hereupon my mind was so withdrawn
    within itself that from without there came
    nothing that then might be received by it

then reigned within my lofty fantasy
    one crucified disdainful and ferocious
    in countenance and even thus was dying

around him were the great ahasuerus
    esther his wife and the just mordecai
    who was in word and action so entire

and even as this image burst asunder
    of its own self in fashion of a bubble
    in which the water it was made of fails

there rose up in my vision a young maiden
    bitterly weeping and she said o queen
    why hast thou wished in anger to be naught

thoust slain thyself lavinia not to lose
    now hast thou lost me i am she who mourns
    mother at thine ere at anothers ruin

as sleep is broken when upon a sudden
    new light strikes in upon the eyelids closed
    and broken quivers ere it dieth wholly

so this imagining of mine fell down
    as soon as the effulgence smote my face
    greater by far than what is in our wont

i turned me round to see where i might be
    when said a voice here is the passage up
    which from all other purposes removed me

and made my wish so full of eagerness
    to look and see who was it that was speaking
    it never rests till meeting face to face

but as before the sun which quells the sight
    and in its own excess its figure veils
    even so my power was insufficient here

this is a spirit divine who in the way
    of going up directs us without asking
    and who with his own light himself conceals

he does with us as man doth with himself
    for he who sees the need and waits the asking
    malignly leans already towrds denial

accord we now our feet to such inviting
    let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark
    for then we could not till the day return

thus my conductor said and i and he
    together turned our footsteps to a stairway
    and i as soon as the first step i reached

near me perceived a motion as of wings
    and fanning in the face and saying beati
    pacifici who are without ill anger

already over us were so uplifted
    the latest sunbeams which the night pursues
    that upon many sides the stars appeared

o manhood mine why dost thou vanish so
    i said within myself for i perceived
    the vigour of my legs was put in truce

we at the point were where no more ascends
    the stairway upward and were motionless
    even as a ship which at the shore arrives

and i gave heed a little if i might hear
    aught whatsoever in the circle new
    then to my master turned me round and said

say my sweet father what delinquency
    is purged here in the circle where we are
    although our feet may pause pause not thy speech

and he to me the love of good remiss
    in what it should have done is here restored
    here plied again the illbelated oar

but still more openly to understand
    turn unto me thy mind and thou shalt gather
    some profitable fruit from our delay

neither creator nor a creature ever
    son he began was destitute of love
    natural or spiritual and thou knowest it

the natural was ever without error
    but err the other may by evil object
    or by too much or by too little vigour

while in the first it well directed is
    and in the second moderates itself
    it cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure

but when to ill it turns and with more care
    or lesser than it ought runs after good
    gainst the creator works his own creation

hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be
    the seed within yourselves of every virtue
    and every act that merits punishment

now inasmuch as never from the welfare
    of its own subject can love turn its sight
    from their own hatred all things are secure

and since we cannot think of any being
    standing alone nor from the first divided
    of hating him is all desire cut off

hence if discriminating i judge well
    the evil that one loves is of ones neighbour
    and this is born in three modes in your clay

there are who by abasement of their neighbour
    hope to excel and therefore only long
    that from his greatness he may be cast down

there are who power grace honour and renown
    fear they may lose because another rises
    thence are so sad that the reverse they love

and there are those whom injury seems to chafe
    so that it makes them greedy for revenge
    and such must needs shape out anothers harm

this threefold love is wept for down below
    now of the other will i have thee hear
    that runneth after good with measure faulty

each one confusedly a good conceives
    wherein the mind may rest and longeth for it
    therefore to overtake it each one strives

if languid love to look on this attract you
    or in attaining unto it this cornice
    after just penitence torments you for it

theres other good that does not make man happy
    tis not felicity tis not the good
    essence of every good the fruit and root

the love that yields itself too much to this
    above us is lamented in three circles
    but how tripartite it may be described

i say not that thou seek it for thyself







an end had put unto his reasoning
    the lofty teacher and attent was looking
    into my face if i appeared content

and i whom a new thirst still goaded on
    without was mute and said within perchance
    the too much questioning i make annoys him

but that true father who had comprehended
    the timid wish that opened not itself
    by speaking gave me hardihood to speak

whence i my sight is master vivified
    so in thy light that clearly i discern
    whateer thy speech importeth or describes

therefore i thee entreat sweet father dear
    to teach me love to which thou dost refer
    every good action and its contrary

direct he said towards me the keen eyes
    of intellect and clear will be to thee
    the error of the blind who would be leaders

the soul which is created apt to love
    is mobile unto everything that pleases
    soon as by pleasure she is waked to action

your apprehension from some real thing
    an image draws and in yourselves displays it
    so that it makes the soul turn unto it

and if when turned towards it she incline
    love is that inclination it is nature
    which is by pleasure bound in you anew

then even as the fire doth upward move
    by its own form which to ascend is born
    where longest in its matter it endures

so comes the captive soul into desire
    which is a motion spiritual and neer rests
    until she doth enjoy the thing beloved

now may apparent be to thee how hidden
    the truth is from those people who aver
    all love is in itself a laudable thing

because its matter may perchance appear
    aye to be good but yet not each impression
    is good albeit good may be the wax

thy words and my sequacious intellect
    i answered him have love revealed to me
    but that has made me more impregned with doubt

for if love from without be offered us
    and with another foot the soul go not
    if right or wrong she go tis not her merit

and he to me what reason seeth here
    myself can tell thee beyond that await
    for beatrice since tis a work of faith

every substantial form that segregate
    from matter is and with it is united
    specific power has in itself collected

which without act is not perceptible
    nor shows itself except by its effect
    as life does in a plant by the green leaves

but still whence cometh the intelligence
    of the first notions man is ignorant
    and the affection for the first allurements

which are in you as instinct in the bee
    to make its honey and this first desire
    merit of praise or blame containeth not

now that to this all others may be gathered
    innate within you is the power that counsels
    and it should keep the threshold of assent

this is the principle from which is taken
    occasion of desert in you according
    as good and guilty loves it takes and winnows

those who in reasoning to the bottom went
    were of this innate liberty aware
    therefore bequeathed they ethics to the world

supposing then that from necessity
    springs every love that is within you kindled
    within yourselves the power is to restrain it

the noble virtue beatrice understands
    by the free will and therefore see that thou
    bear it in mind if she should speak of it

the moon belated almost unto midnight
    now made the stars appear to us more rare
    formed like a bucket that is all ablaze

and counter to the heavens ran through those paths
    which the sun sets aflame when he of rome
    sees it twixt sardes and corsicans go down

and that patrician shade for whom is named
    pietola more than any mantuan town
    had laid aside the burden of my lading

whence i who reason manifest and plain
    in answer to my questions had received
    stood like a man in drowsy reverie

but taken from me was this drowsiness
    suddenly by a people that behind
    our backs already had come round to us

and as of old ismenus and asopus
    beside them saw at night the rush and throng
    if but the thebans were in need of bacchus

so they along that circle curve their step
    from what i saw of those approaching us
    who by goodwill and righteous love are ridden

full soon they were upon us because running
    moved onward all that mighty multitude
    and two in the advance cried out lamenting

mary in haste unto the mountain ran
    and caesar that he might subdue ilerda
    thrust at marseilles and then ran into spain

quick quick so that the time may not be lost
    by little love forthwith the others cried
    for ardour in welldoing freshens grace

o folk in whom an eager fervour now
    supplies perhaps delay and negligence
    put by you in welldoing through lukewarmness

this one who lives and truly i lie not
    would fain go up if but the sun relight us
    so tell us where the passage nearest is

these were the words of him who was my guide
    and some one of those spirits said come on
    behind us and the opening shalt thou find

so full of longing are we to move onward
    that stay we cannot therefore pardon us
    if thou for churlishness our justice take

i was san zenos abbot at verona
    under the empire of good barbarossa
    of whom still sorrowing milan holds discourse

and he has one foot in the grave already
    who shall erelong lament that monastery
    and sorry be of having there had power

because his son in his whole body sick
    and worse in mind and who was evilborn
    he put into the place of its true pastor

if more he said or silent was i know not
    he had already passed so far beyond us
    but this i heard and to retain it pleased me

and he who was in every need my succour
    said turn thee hitherward see two of them
    come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth

in rear of all they shouted sooner were
    the people dead to whom the sea was opened
    than their inheritors the jordan saw

and those who the fatigue did not endure
    unto the issue with anchises son
    themselves to life withouten glory offered

then when from us so separated were
    those shades that they no longer could be seen
    within me a new thought did entrance find

whence others many and diverse were born
    and so i lapsed from one into another
    that in a reverie mine eyes i closed

and meditation into dream transmuted







it was the hour when the diurnal heat
    no more can warm the coldness of the moon
    vanquished by earth or peradventure saturn

when geomancers their fortuna major
    see in the orient before the dawn
    rise by a path that long remains not dim

there came to me in dreams a stammering woman
    squint in her eyes and in her feet distorted
    with hands dissevered and of sallow hue

i looked at her and as the sun restores
    the frigid members which the night benumbs
    even thus my gaze did render voluble

her tongue and made her all erect thereafter
    in little while and the lost countenance
    as love desires it so in her did colour

when in this wise she had her speech unloosed
    she gan to sing so that with difficulty
    could i have turned my thoughts away from her

i am she sang i am the siren sweet
    who mariners amid the main unman
    so full am i of pleasantness to hear

i drew ulysses from his wandering way
    unto my song and he who dwells with me
    seldom departs so wholly i content him

her mouth was not yet closed again before
    appeared a lady saintly and alert
    close at my side to put her to confusion

virgilius o virgilius who is this
    sternly she said and he was drawing near
    with eyes still fixed upon that modest one

she seized the other and in front laid open
    rending her garments and her belly showed me
    this waked me with the stench that issued from it

i turned mine eyes and good virgilius said
    at least thrice have i called thee rise and come
    find we the opening by which thou mayst enter

i rose and full already of high day
    were all the circles of the sacred mountain
    and with the new sun at our back we went

following behind him i my forehead bore
    like unto one who has it laden with thought
    who makes himself the half arch of a bridge

when i heard say come here the passage is
    spoken in a manner gentle and benign
    such as we hear not in this mortal region

with open wings which of a swan appeared
    upward he turned us who thus spake to us
    between the two walls of the solid granite

he moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us
    affirming those qui lugent to be blessed
    for they shall have their souls with comfort filled

what aileth thee that aye to earth thou gazest
    to me my guide began to say we both
    somewhat beyond the angel having mounted

and i with such misgiving makes me go
    a vision new which bends me to itself
    so that i cannot from the thought withdraw me

didst thou behold he said that old enchantress
    who sole above us henceforth is lamented
    didst thou behold how man is freed from her

suffice it thee and smite earth with thy heels
    thine eyes lift upward to the lure that whirls
    the eternal king with revolutions vast

even as the hawk that first his feet surveys
    then turns him to the call and stretches forward
    through the desire of food that draws him thither

such i became and such as far as cleaves
    the rock to give a way to him who mounts
    went on to where the circling doth begin

on the fifth circle when i had come forth
    people i saw upon it who were weeping
    stretched prone upon the ground all downward turned

adhaesit pavimento anima mea
    i heard them say with sighings so profound
    that hardly could the words be understood

o ye elect of god whose sufferings
    justice and hope both render less severe
    direct ye us towards the high ascents

if ye are come secure from this prostration
    and wish to find the way most speedily
    let your right hands be evermore outside

thus did the poet ask and thus was answered
    by them somewhat in front of us whence i
    in what was spoken divined the rest concealed

and unto my lords eyes mine eyes i turned
    whence he assented with a cheerful sign
    to what the sight of my desire implored

when of myself i could dispose at will
    above that creature did i draw myself
    whose words before had caused me to take note

saying o spirit in whom weeping ripens
    that without which to god we cannot turn
    suspend awhile for me thy greater care

who wast thou and why are your backs turned upwards
    tell me and if thou wouldst that i procure thee
    anything there whence living i departed

and he to me wherefore our backs the heaven
    turns to itself know shalt thou but beforehand
    scias quod ego fui successor petri

between siestri and chiaveri descends
    a river beautiful and of its name
    the title of my blood its summit makes

a month and little more essayed i how
    weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it
    for all the other burdens seem a feather

tardy ah woe is me was my conversion
    but when the roman shepherd i was made
    then i discovered life to be a lie

i saw that there the heart was not at rest
    nor farther in that life could one ascend
    whereby the love of this was kindled in me

until that time a wretched soul and parted
    from god was i and wholly avaricious
    now as thou seest i here am punished for it

what avarice does is here made manifest
    in the purgation of these souls converted
    and no more bitter pain the mountain has

even as our eye did not uplift itself
    aloft being fastened upon earthly things
    so justice here has merged it in the earth

as avarice had extinguished our affection
    for every good whereby was action lost
    so justice here doth hold us in restraint

bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands
    and so long as it pleases the just lord
    shall we remain immovable and prostrate

i on my knees had fallen and wished to speak
    but even as i began and he was ware
    only by listening of my reverence

what cause he said has downward bent thee thus
    and i to him for your own dignity
    standing my conscience stung me with remorse

straighten thy legs and upward raise thee brother
    he answered err not fellowservant am i
    with thee and with the others to one power

if eer that holy evangelic sound
    which sayeth neque nubent thou hast heard
    well canst thou see why in this wise i speak

now go no longer will i have thee linger
    because thy stay doth incommode my weeping
    with which i ripen that which thou hast said

on earth i have a grandchild named alagia
    good in herself unless indeed our house
    malevolent may make her by example

and she alone remains to me on earth







ill strives the will against a better will
    therefore to pleasure him against my pleasure
    i drew the sponge not saturate from the water

onward i moved and onward moved my leader
    through vacant places skirting still the rock
    as on a wall close to the battlements

for they that through their eyes pour drop by drop
    the malady which all the world pervades
    on the other side too near the verge approach

accursed mayst thou be thou old shewolf
    that more than all the other beasts hast prey
    because of hunger infinitely hollow

o heaven in whose gyrations some appear
    to think conditions here below are changed
    when will he come through whom she shall depart

onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce
    and i attentive to the shades i heard
    piteously weeping and bemoaning them

and i by peradventure heard sweet mary
    uttered in front of us amid the weeping
    even as a woman does who is in childbirth

and in continuance how poor thou wast
    is manifested by that hostelry
    where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down

thereafterward i heard o good fabricius
    virtue with poverty didst thou prefer
    to the possession of great wealth with vice

so pleasurable were these words to me
    that i drew farther onward to have knowledge
    touching that spirit whence they seemed to come

he furthermore was speaking of the largess
    which nicholas unto the maidens gave
    in order to conduct their youth to honour

o soul that dost so excellently speak
    tell me who wast thou said i and why only
    thou dost renew these praises well deserved

not without recompense shall be thy word
    if i return to finish the short journey
    of that life which is flying to its end

and he ill tell thee not for any comfort
    i may expect from earth but that so much
    grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead

i was the root of that malignant plant
    which overshadows all the christian world
    so that good fruit is seldom gathered from it

but if douay and ghent and lille and bruges
    had power soon vengeance would be taken on it
    and this i pray of him who judges all

hugh capet was i called upon the earth
    from me were born the louises and philips
    by whom in later days has france been governed

i was the son of a parisian butcher
    what time the ancient kings had perished all
    excepting one contrite in cloth of gray

i found me grasping in my hands the rein
    of the realms government and so great power
    of new acquest and so with friends abounding

that to the widowed diadem promoted
    the head of mine own offspring was from whom
    the consecrated bones of these began

so long as the great dowry of provence
    out of my blood took not the sense of shame
    twas little worth but still it did no harm

then it began with falsehood and with force
    its rapine and thereafter for amends
    took ponthieu normandy and gascony

charles came to italy and for amends
    a victim made of conradin and then
    thrust thomas back to heaven for amends

a time i see not very distant now
    which draweth forth another charles from france
    the better to make known both him and his

unarmed he goes and only with the lance
    that judas jousted with and that he thrusts
    so that he makes the paunch of florence burst

he thence not land but sin and infamy
    shall gain so much more grievous to himself
    as the more light such damage he accounts

the other now gone forth taen in his ship
    see i his daughter sell and chaffer for her
    as corsairs do with other female slaves

what more o avarice canst thou do to us
    since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn
    it careth not for its own proper flesh

that less may seem the future ill and past
    i see the flowerdeluce alagna enter
    and christ in his own vicar captive made

i see him yet another time derided
    i see renewed the vinegar and gall
    and between living thieves i see him slain

i see the modern pilate so relentless
    this does not sate him but without decretal
    he to the temple bears his sordid sails

when o my lord shall i be joyful made
    by looking on the vengeance which concealed
    makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy

what i was saying of that only bride
    of the holy ghost and which occasioned thee
    to turn towards me for some commentary

so long has been ordained to all our prayers
    as the day lasts but when the night comes on
    contrary sound we take instead thereof

at that time we repeat pygmalion
    of whom a traitor thief and parricide
    made his insatiable desire of gold

and the misery of avaricious midas
    that followed his inordinate demand
    at which forevermore one needs but laugh

the foolish achan each one then records
    and how he stole the spoils so that the wrath
    of joshua still appears to sting him here

then we accuse sapphira with her husband
    we laud the hoofbeats heliodorus had
    and the whole mount in infamy encircles

polymnestor who murdered polydorus
    here finally is cried o crassus tell us
    for thou dost know what is the taste of gold

sometimes we speak one loud another low
    according to desire of speech that spurs us
    to greater now and now to lesser pace

but in the good that here by day is talked of
    erewhile alone i was not yet near by
    no other person lifted up his voice

from him already we departed were
    and made endeavour to oercome the road
    as much as was permitted to our power

when i perceived like something that is falling
    the mountain tremble whence a chill seized on me
    as seizes him who to his death is going

certes so violently shook not delos
    before latona made her nest therein
    to give birth to the two eyes of the heaven

then upon all sides there began a cry
    such that the master drew himself towards me
    saying fear not while i am guiding thee

gloria in excelsis deo all
    were saying from what near i comprehended
    where it was possible to hear the cry

we paused immovable and in suspense
    even as the shepherds who first heard that song
    until the trembling ceased and it was finished

then we resumed again our holy path
    watching the shades that lay upon the ground
    already turned to their accustomed plaint

no ignorance ever with so great a strife
    had rendered me importunate to know
    if erreth not in this my memory

as meditating then i seemed to have
    nor out of haste to question did i dare
    nor of myself i there could aught perceive

so i went onward timorous and thoughtful







the natural thirst that neer is satisfied
    excepting with the water for whose grace
    the woman of samaria besought

put me in travail and haste goaded me
    along the encumbered path behind my leader
    and i was pitying that righteous vengeance

and lo in the same manner as luke writeth
    that christ appeared to two upon the way
    from the sepulchral cave already risen

a shade appeared to us and came behind us
    down gazing on the prostrate multitude
    nor were we ware of it until it spake

saying my brothers may god give you peace
    we turned us suddenly and virgilius rendered
    to him the countersign thereto conforming

thereon began he in the blessed council
    thee may the court veracious place in peace
    that me doth banish in eternal exile

how said he and the while we went with speed
    if ye are shades whom god deigns not on high
    who up his stairs so far has guided you

and said my teacher if thou note the marks
    which this one bears and which the angel traces
    well shalt thou see he with the good must reign

but because she who spinneth day and night
    for him had not yet drawn the distaff off
    which clotho lays for each one and compacts

his soul which is thy sister and my own
    in coming upwards could not come alone
    by reason that it sees not in our fashion

whence i was drawn from out the ample throat
    of hell to be his guide and i shall guide him
    as far on as my school has power to lead

but tell us if thou knowest why such a shudder
    erewhile the mountain gave and why together
    all seemed to cry as far as its moist feet

in asking he so hit the very eye
    of my desire that merely with the hope
    my thirst became the less unsatisfied

naught is there he began that without order
    may the religion of the mountain feel
    nor aught that may be foreign to its custom

free is it here from every permutation
    what from itself heaven in itself receiveth
    can be of this the cause and naught beside

because that neither rain nor hail nor snow
    nor dew nor hoarfrost any higher falls
    than the short little stairway of three steps

dense clouds do not appear nor rarefied
    nor coruscation nor the daughter of thaumas
    that often upon earth her region shifts

no arid vapour any farther rises
    than to the top of the three steps i spake of
    whereon the vicar of peter has his feet

lower down perchance it trembles less or more
    but for the wind that in the earth is hidden
    i know not how up here it never trembled

it trembles here whenever any soul
    feels itself pure so that it soars or moves
    to mount aloft and such a cry attends it

of purity the will alone gives proof
    which being wholly free to change its convent
    takes by surprise the soul and helps it fly

first it wills well but the desire permits not
    which divine justice with the selfsame will
    there was to sin upon the torment sets

and i who have been lying in this pain
    five hundred years and more but just now felt
    a free volition for a better seat

therefore thou heardst the earthquake and the pious
    spirits along the mountain rendering praise
    unto the lord that soon he speed them upwards

so said he to him and since we enjoy
    as much in drinking as the thirst is great
    i could not say how much it did me good

and the wise leader now i see the net
    that snares you here and how ye are set free
    why the earth quakes and wherefore ye rejoice

now who thou wast be pleased that i may know
    and why so many centuries thou hast here
    been lying let me gather from thy words

in days when the good titus with the aid
    of the supremest king avenged the wounds
    whence issued forth the blood by judas sold

under the name that most endures and honours
    was i on earth that spirit made reply
    greatly renowned but not with faith as yet

my vocal spirit was so sweet that rome
    me a thoulousian drew unto herself
    where i deserved to deck my brows with myrtle

statius the people name me still on earth
    i sang of thebes and then of great achilles
    but on the way fell with my second burden

the seeds unto my ardour were the sparks
    of that celestial flame which heated me
    whereby more than a thousand have been fired

of the aeneid speak i which to me
    a mother was and was my nurse in song
    without this weighed i not a drachmas weight

and to have lived upon the earth what time
    virgilius lived i would accept one sun
    more than i must ere issuing from my ban

these words towards me made virgilius turn
    with looks that in their silence said be silent
    but yet the power that wills cannot do all things

for tears and laughter are such pursuivants
    unto the passion from which each springs forth
    in the most truthful least the will they follow

i only smiled as one who gives the wink
    whereat the shade was silent and it gazed
    into mine eyes where most expression dwells

and as thou well mayst consummate a labour
    so great it said why did thy face just now
    display to me the lightning of a smile

now am i caught on this side and on that
    one keeps me silent one to speak conjures me
    wherefore i sigh and i am understood

speak said my master and be not afraid
    of speaking but speak out and say to him
    what he demands with such solicitude

whence i thou peradventure marvellest
    o antique spirit at the smile i gave
    but i will have more wonder seize upon thee

this one who guides on high these eyes of mine
    is that virgilius from whom thou didst learn
    to sing aloud of men and of the gods

if other cause thou to my smile imputedst
    abandon it as false and trust it was
    those words which thou hast spoken concerning him

already he was stooping to embrace
    my teachers feet but he said to him brother
    do not for shade thou art and shade beholdest

and he uprising now canst thou the sum
    of love which warms me to thee comprehend
    when this our vanity i disremember

treating a shadow as substantial thing







already was the angel left behind us
    the angel who to the sixth round had turned us
    having erased one mark from off my face

and those who have in justice their desire
    had said to us beati in their voices
    with sitio and without more ended it

and i more light than through the other passes
    went onward so that without any labour
    i followed upward the swiftfooted spirits

when thus virgilius began the love
    kindled by virtue aye another kindles
    provided outwardly its flame appear

hence from the hour that juvenal descended
    among us into the infernal limbo
    who made apparent to me thy affection

my kindliness towards thee was as great
    as ever bound one to an unseen person
    so that these stairs will now seem short to me

but tell me and forgive me as a friend
    if too great confidence let loose the rein
    and as a friend now hold discourse with me

how was it possible within thy breast
    for avarice to find place mid so much wisdom
    as thou wast filled with by thy diligence

these words excited statius at first
    somewhat to laughter afterward he answered
    each word of thine is loves dear sign to me

verily oftentimes do things appear
    which give fallacious matter to our doubts
    instead of the true causes which are hidden

thy question shows me thy belief to be
    that i was niggard in the other life
    it may be from the circle where i was

therefore know thou that avarice was removed
    too far from me and this extravagance
    thousands of lunar periods have punished

and were it not that i my thoughts uplifted
    when i the passage heard where thou exclaimest
    as if indignant unto human nature

to what impellest thou not o cursed hunger
    of gold the appetite of mortal men
    revolving i should feel the dismal joustings

then i perceived the hands could spread too wide
    their wings in spending and repented me
    as well of that as of my other sins

how many with shorn hair shall rise again
    because of ignorance which from this sin
    cuts off repentance living and in death

and know that the transgression which rebuts
    by direct opposition any sin
    together with it here its verdure dries

therefore if i have been among that folk
    which mourns its avarice to purify me
    for its opposite has this befallen me

now when thou sangest the relentless weapons
    of the twofold affliction of jocasta
    the singer of the songs bucolic said

from that which clio there with thee preludes
    it does not seem that yet had made thee faithful
    that faith without which no good works suffice

if this be so what candles or what sun
    scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim
    thy sails behind the fisherman thereafter

and he to him thou first directedst me
    towards parnassus in its grots to drink
    and first concerning god didst me enlighten

thou didst as he who walketh in the night
    who bears his light behind which helps him not
    but wary makes the persons after him

when thou didst say the age renews itself
    justice returns and mans primeval time
    and a new progeny descends from heaven

through thee i poet was through thee a christian
    but that thou better see what i design
    to colour it will i extend my hand

already was the world in every part
    pregnant with the true creed disseminated
    by messengers of the eternal kingdom

and thy assertion spoken of above
    with the new preachers was in unison
    whence i to visit them the custom took

then they became so holy in my sight
    that when domitian persecuted them
    not without tears of mine were their laments

and all the while that i on earth remained
    them i befriended and their upright customs
    made me disparage all the other sects

and ere i led the greeks unto the rivers
    of thebes in poetry i was baptized
    but out of fear was covertly a christian

for a long time professing paganism
    and this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle
    to circuit round more than four centuries

thou therefore who hast raised the covering
    that hid from me whatever good i speak of
    while in ascending we have time to spare

tell me in what place is our friend terentius
    caecilius plautus varro if thou knowest
    tell me if they are damned and in what alley

these persius and myself and others many
    replied my leader with that grecian are
    whom more than all the rest the muses suckled

in the first circle of the prison blind
    ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse
    which has our nurses ever with itself

euripides is with us antiphon
    simonides agatho and many other
    greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked

there some of thine own people may be seen
    antigone deiphile and argia
    and there ismene mournful as of old

there she is seen who pointed out langia
    there is tiresias daughter and there thetis
    and there deidamia with her sisters

silent already were the poets both
    attent once more in looking round about
    from the ascent and from the walls released

and four handmaidens of the day already
    were left behind and at the pole the fifth
    was pointing upward still its burning horn

what time my guide i think that towrds the edge
    our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn
    circling the mount as we are wont to do

thus in that region custom was our ensign
    and we resumed our way with less suspicion
    for the assenting of that worthy soul

they in advance went on and i alone
    behind them and i listened to their speech
    which gave me lessons in the art of song

but soon their sweet discourses interrupted
    a tree which midway in the road we found
    with apples sweet and grateful to the smell

and even as a firtree tapers upward
    from bough to bough so downwardly did that
    i think in order that no one might climb it

on that side where our pathway was enclosed
    fell from the lofty rock a limpid water
    and spread itself abroad upon the leaves

the poets twain unto the tree drew near
    and from among the foliage a voice
    cried of this food ye shall have scarcity

then said more thoughtful mary was of making
    the marriage feast complete and honourable
    than of her mouth which now for you responds

and for their drink the ancient roman women
    with water were content and daniel
    disparaged food and understanding won

the primal age was beautiful as gold
    acorns it made with hunger savorous
    and nectar every rivulet with thirst

honey and locusts were the aliments
    that fed the baptist in the wilderness
    whence he is glorious and so magnified

as by the evangel is revealed to you







the while among the verdant leaves mine eyes
    i riveted as he is wont to do
    who wastes his life pursuing little birds

my more than father said unto me son
    come now because the time that is ordained us
    more usefully should be apportioned out

i turned my face and no less soon my steps
    unto the sages who were speaking so
    they made the going of no cost to me

and lo were heard a song and a lament
    labia mea domine in fashion
    such that delight and dolence it brought forth

o my sweet father what is this i hear
    began i and he answered shades that go
    perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt

in the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do
    who unknown people on the road oertaking
    turn themselves round to them and do not stop

even thus behind us with a swifter motion
    coming and passing onward gazed upon us
    a crowd of spirits silent and devout

each in his eyes was dark and cavernous
    pallid in face and so emaciate
    that from the bones the skin did shape itself

i do not think that so to merest rind
    could erisichthon have been withered up
    by famine when most fear he had of it

thinking within myself i said behold
    this is the folk who lost jerusalem
    when mary made a prey of her own son

their sockets were like rings without the gems
    whoever in the face of men reads omo
    might well in these have recognised the m

who would believe the odour of an apple
    begetting longing could consume them so
    and that of water without knowing how

i still was wondering what so famished them
    for the occasion not yet manifest
    of their emaciation and sad squalor

and lo from out the hollow of his head
    his eyes a shade turned on me and looked keenly
    then cried aloud what grace to me is this

never should i have known him by his look
    but in his voice was evident to me
    that which his aspect had suppressed within it

this spark within me wholly reenkindled
    my recognition of his altered face
    and i recalled the features of forese

ah do not look at this dry leprosy
    entreated he which doth my skin discolour
    nor at default of flesh that i may have

but tell me truth of thee and who are those
    two souls that yonder make for thee an escort
    do not delay in speaking unto me

that face of thine which dead i once bewept
    gives me for weeping now no lesser grief
    i answered him beholding it so changed

but tell me for gods sake what thus denudes you
    make me not speak while i am marvelling
    for ill speaks he whos full of other longings

and he to me from the eternal council
    falls power into the water and the tree
    behind us left whereby i grow so thin

all of this people who lamenting sing
    for following beyond measure appetite
    in hunger and thirst are here resanctified

desire to eat and drink enkindles in us
    the scent that issues from the appletree
    and from the spray that sprinkles oer the verdure

and not a single time alone this ground
    encompassing is refreshed our pain
    i say our pain and ought to say our solace

for the same wish doth lead us to the tree
    which led the christ rejoicing to say eli
    when with his veins he liberated us

and i to him forese from that day
    when for a better life thou changedst worlds
    up to this time five years have not rolled round

if sooner were the power exhausted in thee
    of sinning more than thee the hour surprised
    of that good sorrow which to god reweds us

how hast thou come up hitherward already
    i thought to find thee down there underneath
    where time for time doth restitution make

and he to me thus speedily has led me
    to drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments
    my nella with her overflowing tears

she with her prayers devout and with her sighs
    has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits
    and from the other circles set me free

so much more dear and pleasing is to god
    my little widow whom so much i loved
    as in good works she is the more alone

for the barbagia of sardinia
    by far more modest in its women is
    than the barbagia i have left her in

o brother sweet what wilt thou have me say
    a future time is in my sight already
    to which this hour will not be very old

when from the pulpit shall be interdicted
    to the unblushing womankind of florence
    to go about displaying breast and paps

what savages were eer what saracens
    who stood in need to make them covered go
    of spiritual or other discipline

but if the shameless women were assured
    of what swift heaven prepares for them already
    wide open would they have their mouths to howl

for if my foresight here deceive me not
    they shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks
    who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby

o brother now no longer hide thee from me
    see that not only i but all these people
    are gazing there where thou dost veil the sun

whence i to him if thou bring back to mind
    what thou with me hast been and i with thee
    the present memory will be grievous still

out of that life he turned me back who goes
    in front of me two days agone when round
    the sister of him yonder showed herself

and to the sun i pointed  through the deep
    night of the truly dead has this one led me
    with this true flesh that follows after him

thence his encouragements have led me up
    ascending and still circling round the mount
    that you doth straighten whom the world made crooked

he says that he will bear me company
    till i shall be where beatrice will be
    there it behoves me to remain without him

this is virgilius who thus says to me
    and him i pointed at the other is
    that shade for whom just now shook every slope

your realm that from itself discharges him







nor speech the going nor the going that
    slackened but talking we went bravely on
    even as a vessel urged by a good wind

and shadows that appeared things doubly dead
    from out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed
    wonder at me aware that i was living

and i continuing my colloquy
    said peradventure he goes up more slowly
    than he would do for other peoples sake

but tell me if thou knowest where is piccarda
    tell me if any one of note i see
    among this folk that gazes at me so

my sister who twixt beautiful and good
    i know not which was more triumphs rejoicing
    already in her crown on high olympus

so said he first and then tis not forbidden
    to name each other here so milked away
    is our resemblance by our dieting

this pointing with his finger is buonagiunta
    buonagiunta of lucca and that face
    beyond him there more peaked than the others

has held the holy church within his arms
    from tours was he and purges by his fasting
    bolsenas eels and the vernaccia wine

he named me many others one by one
    and all contented seemed at being named
    so that for this i saw not one dark look

i saw for hunger bite the empty air
    ubaldin dalla pila and boniface
    who with his crook had pastured many people

i saw messer marchese who had leisure
    once at forli for drinking with less dryness
    and he was one who neer felt satisfied

but as he does who scans and then doth prize
    one more than others did i him of lucca
    who seemed to take most cognizance of me

he murmured and i know not what gentucca
    from that place heard i where he felt the wound
    of justice that doth macerate them so

o soul i said that seemest so desirous
    to speak with me do so that i may hear thee
    and with thy speech appease thyself and me

a maid is born and wears not yet the veil
    began he who to thee shall pleasant make
    my city howsoever men may blame it

thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision
    if by my murmuring thou hast been deceived
    true things hereafter will declare it to thee

but say if him i here behold who forth
    evoked the newinvented rhymes beginning
    ladies that have intelligence of love

and i to him one am i who whenever
    love doth inspire me note and in that measure
    which he within me dictates singing go

o brother now i see he said the knot
    which me the notary and guittone held
    short of the sweet new style that now i hear

i do perceive full clearly how your pens
    go closely following after him who dictates
    which with our own forsooth came not to pass

and he who sets himself to go beyond
    no difference sees from one style to another
    and as if satisfied he held his peace

even as the birds that winter towrds the nile
    sometimes into a phalanx form themselves
    then fly in greater haste and go in file

in such wise all the people who were there
    turning their faces hurried on their steps
    both by their leanness and their wishes light

and as a man who weary is with trotting
    lets his companions onward go and walks
    until he vents the panting of his chest

so did forese let the holy flock
    pass by and came with me behind it saying
    when will it be that i again shall see thee

how long i answered i may live i know not
    yet my return will not so speedy be
    but i shall sooner in desire arrive

because the place where i was set to live
    from day to day of good is more depleted
    and unto dismal ruin seems ordained

now go he said for him most guilty of it
    at a beasts tail behold i dragged along
    towards the valley where is no repentance

faster at every step the beast is going
    increasing evermore until it smites him
    and leaves the body vilely mutilated

not long those wheels shall turn and he uplifted
    his eyes to heaven ere shall be clear to thee
    that which my speech no farther can declare

now stay behind because the time so precious
    is in this kingdom that i lose too much
    by coming onward thus abreast with thee

as sometimes issues forth upon a gallop
    a cavalier from out a troop that ride
    and seeks the honour of the first encounter

so he with greater strides departed from us
    and on the road remained i with those two
    who were such mighty marshals of the world

and when before us he had gone so far
    mine eyes became to him such pursuivants
    as was my understanding to his words

appeared to me with laden and living boughs
    another appletree and not far distant
    from having but just then turned thitherward

people i saw beneath it lift their hands
    and cry i know not what towards the leaves
    like little children eager and deluded

who pray and he they pray to doth not answer
    but to make very keen their appetite
    holds their desire aloft and hides it not

then they departed as if undeceived
    and now we came unto the mighty tree
    which prayers and tears so manifold refuses

pass farther onward without drawing near
    the tree of which eve ate is higher up
    and out of that one has this tree been raised

thus said i know not who among the branches
    whereat virgilius statius and myself
    went crowding forward on the side that rises

be mindful said he of the accursed ones
    formed of the cloudrack who inebriate
    combated theseus with their double breasts

and of the jews who showed them soft in drinking
    whence gideon would not have them for companions
    when he towrds midian the hills descended

thus closely pressed to one of the two borders
    on passed we hearing sins of gluttony
    followed forsooth by miserable gains

then set at large upon the lonely road
    a thousand steps and more we onward went
    in contemplation each without a word

what go ye thinking thus ye three alone
    said suddenly a voice whereat i started
    as terrified and timid beasts are wont

i raised my head to see who this might be
    and never in a furnace was there seen
    metals or glass so lucent and so red

as one i saw who said if it may please you
    to mount aloft here it behoves you turn
    this way goes he who goeth after peace

his aspect had bereft me of my sight
    so that i turned me back unto my teachers
    like one who goeth as his hearing guides him

and as the harbinger of early dawn
    the air of may doth move and breathe out fragrance
    impregnate all with herbage and with flowers

so did i feel a breeze strike in the midst
    my front and felt the moving of the plumes
    that breathed around an odour of ambrosia

and heard it said blessed are they whom grace
    so much illumines that the love of taste
    excites not in their breasts too great desire

hungering at all times so far as is just







now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked
    because the sun had his meridian circle
    to taurus left and night to scorpio

wherefore as doth a man who tarries not
    but goes his way whateer to him appear
    if of necessity the sting transfix him

in this wise did we enter through the gap
    taking the stairway one before the other
    which by its narrowness divides the climbers

and as the little stork that lifts its wing
    with a desire to fly and does not venture
    to leave the nest and lets it downward droop

even such was i with the desire of asking
    kindled and quenched unto the motion coming
    he makes who doth address himself to speak

not for our pace though rapid it might be
    my father sweet forbore but said let fly
    the bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn

with confidence i opened then my mouth
    and i began how can one meagre grow
    there where the need of nutriment applies not

if thou wouldst call to mind how meleager
    was wasted by the wasting of a brand
    this would not said he be to thee so sour

and wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion
    trembles within a mirror your own image
    that which seems hard would mellow seem to thee

but that thou mayst content thee in thy wish
    lo statius here and him i call and pray
    he now will be the healer of thy wounds

if i unfold to him the eternal vengeance
    responded statius where thou present art
    be my excuse that i can naught deny thee

then he began son if these words of mine
    thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive
    theyll be thy light unto the how thou sayest

the perfect blood which never is drunk up
    into the thirsty veins and which remaineth
    like food that from the table thou removest

takes in the heart for all the human members
    virtue informative as being that
    which to be changed to them goes through the veins

again digest descends it where tis better
    silent to be than say and then drops thence
    upon anothers blood in natural vase

there one together with the other mingles
    one to be passive meant the other active
    by reason of the perfect place it springs from

and being conjoined begins to operate
    coagulating first then vivifying
    what for its matter it had made consistent

the active virtue being made a soul
    as of a plant 

then works so much that now it moves and feels
    like a seafungus and then undertakes
    to organize the powers whose seed it is

now son dilates and now distends itself
    the virtue from the generators heart
    where nature is intent on all the members

but how from animal it man becomes
    thou dost not see as yet this is a point
    which made a wiser man than thou once err

so far that in his doctrine separate
    he made the soul from possible intellect
    for he no organ saw by this assumed

open thy breast unto the truth thats coming
    and know that just as soon as in the foetus
    the articulation of the brain is perfect

the primal motor turns to it well pleased
    at so great art of nature and inspires
    a spirit new with virtue all replete

which what it finds there active doth attract
    into its substance and becomes one soul
    which lives and feels and on itself revolves

and that thou less may wonder at my word
    behold the suns heat which becometh wine
    joined to the juice that from the vine distils

whenever lachesis has no more thread
    it separates from the flesh and virtually
    bears with itself the human and divine

the other faculties are voiceless all
    the memory the intelligence and the will
    in action far more vigorous than before

without a pause it falleth of itself
    in marvellous way on one shore or the other
    there of its roads it first is cognizant

soon as the place there circumscribeth it
    the virtue informative rays round about
    as and as much as in the living members

and even as the air when full of rain
    by alien rays that are therein reflected
    with divers colours shows itself adorned

so there the neighbouring air doth shape itself
    into that form which doth impress upon it
    virtually the soul that has stood still

and then in manner of the little flame
    which followeth the fire whereer it shifts
    after the spirit followeth its new form

since afterwards it takes from this its semblance
    it is called shade and thence it organizes
    thereafter every sense even to the sight

thence is it that we speak and thence we laugh
    thence is it that we form the tears and sighs
    that on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard

according as impress us our desires
    and other affections so the shade is shaped
    and this is cause of what thou wonderest at

and now unto the last of all the circles
    had we arrived and to the right hand turned
    and were attentive to another care

there the embankment shoots forth flames of fire
    and upward doth the cornice breathe a blast
    that drives them back and from itself sequesters

hence we must needs go on the open side
    and one by one and i did fear the fire
    on this side and on that the falling down

my leader said along this place one ought
    to keep upon the eyes a tightened rein
    seeing that one so easily might err

summae deus clementiae in the bosom
    of the great burning chanted then i heard
    which made me no less eager to turn round

and spirits saw i walking through the flame
    wherefore i looked to my own steps and theirs
    apportioning my sight from time to time

after the close which to that hymn is made
    aloud they shouted virum non cognosco
    then recommenced the hymn with voices low

this also ended cried they to the wood
    diana ran and drove forth helice
    therefrom who had of venus felt the poison

then to their song returned they then the wives
    they shouted and the husbands who were chaste
    as virtue and the marriage vow imposes

and i believe that them this mode suffices
    for all the time the fire is burning them
    with such care is it needful and such food

that the last wound of all should be closed up







while on the brink thus one before the other
    we went upon our way oft the good master
    said take thou heed suffice it that i warn thee

on the right shoulder smote me now the sun
    that raying out already the whole west
    changed from its azure aspect into white

and with my shadow did i make the flame
    appear more red and even to such a sign
    shades saw i many as they went give heed

this was the cause that gave them a beginning
    to speak of me and to themselves began they
    to say that seems not a factitious body

then towards me as far as they could come
    came certain of them always with regard
    not to step forth where they would not be burned

o thou who goest not from being slower
    but reverent perhaps behind the others
    answer me who in thirst and fire am burning

nor to me only is thine answer needful
    for all of these have greater thirst for it
    than for cold water ethiop or indian

tell us how is it that thou makest thyself
    a wall unto the sun as if thou hadst not
    entered as yet into the net of death

thus one of them addressed me and i straight
    should have revealed myself were i not bent
    on other novelty that then appeared

for through the middle of the burning road
    there came a people face to face with these
    which held me in suspense with gazing at them

there see i hastening upon either side
    each of the shades and kissing one another
    without a pause content with brief salute

thus in the middle of their brown battalions
    muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another
    perchance to spy their journey or their fortune

no sooner is the friendly greeting ended
    or ever the first footstep passes onward
    each one endeavours to outcry the other

the newcome people sodom and gomorrah
    the rest into the cow pasiphae enters
    so that the bull unto her lust may run

then as the cranes that to riphaean mountains
    might fly in part and part towards the sands
    these of the frost those of the sun avoidant

one folk is going and the other coming
    and weeping they return to their first songs
    and to the cry that most befitteth them

and close to me approached even as before
    the very same who had entreated me
    attent to listen in their countenance

i who their inclination twice had seen
    began o souls secure in the possession
    wheneer it may be of a state of peace

neither unripe nor ripened have remained
    my members upon earth but here are with me
    with their own blood and their articulations

i go up here to be no longer blind
    a lady is above who wins this grace
    whereby the mortal through your world i bring

but as your greatest longing satisfied
    may soon become so that the heaven may house you
    which full of love is and most amply spreads

tell me that i again in books may write it
    who are you and what is that multitude
    which goes upon its way behind your backs

not otherwise with wonder is bewildered
    the mountaineer and staring round is dumb
    when rough and rustic to the town he goes

than every shade became in its appearance
    but when they of their stupor were disburdened
    which in high hearts is quickly quieted

blessed be thou who of our borderlands
    he recommenced who first had questioned us
    experience freightest for a better life

the folk that comes not with us have offended
    in that for which once caesar triumphing
    heard himself called in contumely queen

therefore they separate exclaiming sodom
    themselves reproving even as thou hast heard
    and add unto their burning by their shame

our own transgression was hermaphrodite
    but because we observed not human law
    following like unto beasts our appetite

in our opprobrium by us is read
    when we part company the name of her
    who bestialized herself in bestial wood

now knowest thou our acts and what our crime was
    wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are
    there is not time to tell nor could i do it

thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted
    im guido guinicelli and now purge me
    having repented ere the hour extreme

the same that in the sadness of lycurgus
    two sons became their mother rebeholding
    such i became but rise not to such height

the moment i heard name himself the father
    of me and of my betters who had ever
    practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love

and without speech and hearing thoughtfully
    for a long time i went beholding him
    nor for the fire did i approach him nearer

when i was fed with looking utterly
    myself i offered ready for his service
    with affirmation that compels belief

and he to me thou leavest footprints such
    in me from what i hear and so distinct
    lethe cannot efface them nor make dim

but if thy words just now the truth have sworn
    tell me what is the cause why thou displayest
    in word and look that dear thou holdest me

and i to him those dulcet lays of yours
    which long as shall endure our modern fashion
    shall make for ever dear their very ink

o brother said he he whom i point out
    and here he pointed at a spirit in front
    was of the mother tongue a better smith

verses of love and proses of romance
    he mastered all and let the idiots talk
    who think the lemosin surpasses him

to clamour more than truth they turn their faces
    and in this way establish their opinion
    ere art or reason has by them been heard

thus many ancients with guittone did
    from cry to cry still giving him applause
    until the truth has conquered with most persons

now if thou hast such ample privilege
    tis granted thee to go unto the cloister
    wherein is christ the abbot of the college

to him repeat for me a paternoster
    so far as needful to us of this world
    where power of sinning is no longer ours

then to give place perchance to one behind
    whom he had near he vanished in the fire
    as fish in water going to the bottom

i moved a little towrds him pointed out
    and said that to his name my own desire
    an honourable place was making ready

he of his own free will began to say
    tan m abellis vostre cortes deman
    que jeu nom puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire

jeu sui arnaut que plor e vai chantan
    consiros vei la passada folor
    e vei jauzen lo jorn qu esper denan

ara vus prec per aquella valor
    que vus condus al som de la scalina
    sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor

then hid him in the fire that purifies them

 so pleases me your courteous demand
    i cannot and i will not hide me from you
i am arnaut who weep and singing go
    contrite i see the folly of the past
    and joyous see the hopedfor day before me
therefore do i implore you by that power
    which guides you to the summit of the stairs
    be mindful to assuage my suffering







as when he vibrates forth his earliest rays
    in regions where his maker shed his blood
    
    so stood the sun hence was the day departing
    when the glad angel of god appeared to us

outside the flame he stood upon the verge
    and chanted forth beati mundo corde
    in voice by far more living than our own

then no one farther goes souls sanctified
    if first the fire bite not within it enter
    and be not deaf unto the song beyond

when we were close beside him thus he said
    wherefore een such became i when i heard him
    as he is who is put into the grave

upon my clasped hands i straightened me
    scanning the fire and vividly recalling
    the human bodies i had once seen burned

towards me turned themselves my good conductors
    and unto me virgilius said my son
    here may indeed be torment but not death

remember thee remember and if i
    on geryon have safely guided thee
    what shall i do now i am nearer god

believe for certain shouldst thou stand a full
    millennium in the bosom of this flame
    it could not make thee bald a single hair

and if perchance thou think that i deceive thee
    draw near to it and put it to the proof
    with thine own hands upon thy garments hem

now lay aside now lay aside all fear
    turn hitherward and onward come securely
    and i still motionless and gainst my conscience

seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn
    somewhat disturbed he said now look thou son
    twixt beatrice and thee there is this wall

as at the name of thisbe oped his lids
    the dying pyramus and gazed upon her
    what time the mulberry became vermilion

even thus my obduracy being softened
    i turned to my wise guide hearing the name
    that in my memory evermore is welling

whereat he wagged his head and said how now
    shall we stay on this side then smiled as one
    does at a child whos vanquished by an apple

then into the fire in front of me he entered
    beseeching statius to come after me
    who a long way before divided us

when i was in it into molten glass
    i would have cast me to refresh myself
    so without measure was the burning there

and my sweet father to encourage me
    discoursing still of beatrice went on
    saying her eyes i seem to see already

a voice that on the other side was singing
    directed us and we attent alone
    on that came forth where the ascent began

venite benedicti patris mei
    sounded within a splendour which was there
    such it oercame me and i could not look

the sun departs it added and night cometh
    tarry ye not but onward urge your steps
    so long as yet the west becomes not dark

straight forward through the rock the path ascended
    in such a way that i cut off the rays
    before me of the sun that now was low

and of few stairs we yet had made assay
    ere by the vanished shadow the suns setting
    behind us we perceived i and my sages

and ere in all its parts immeasurable
    the horizon of one aspect had become
    and night her boundless dispensation held

each of us of a stair had made his bed
    because the nature of the mount took from us
    the power of climbing more than the delight

even as in ruminating passive grow
    the goats who have been swift and venturesome
    upon the mountaintops ere they were fed

hushed in the shadow while the sun is hot
    watched by the herdsman who upon his staff
    is leaning and in leaning tendeth them

and as the shepherd lodging out of doors
    passes the night beside his quiet flock
    watching that no wild beast may scatter it

such at that hour were we all three of us
    i like the goat and like the herdsmen they
    begirt on this side and on that by rocks

little could there be seen of things without
    but through that little i beheld the stars
    more luminous and larger than their wont

thus ruminating and beholding these
    sleep seized upon mesleep that oftentimes
    before a deed is done has tidings of it

it was the hour i think when from the east
    first on the mountain citherea beamed
    who with the fire of love seems always burning

youthful and beautiful in dreams methought
    i saw a lady walking in a meadow
    gathering flowers and singing she was saying

know whosoever may my name demand
    that i am leah and go moving round
    my beauteous hands to make myself a garland

to please me at the mirror here i deck me
    but never does my sister rachel leave
    her lookingglass and sitteth all day long

to see her beauteous eyes as eager is she
    as i am to adorn me with my hands
    her seeing and me doing satisfies

and now before the antelucan splendours
    that unto pilgrims the more grateful rise
    as homereturning less remote they lodge

the darkness fled away on every side
    and slumber with it whereupon i rose
    seeing already the great masters risen

that apple sweet which through so many branches
    the care of mortals goeth in pursuit of
    today shall put in peace thy hungerings

speaking to me virgilius of such words
    as these made use and never were there guerdons
    that could in pleasantness compare with these

such longing upon longing came upon me
    to be above that at each step thereafter
    for flight i felt in me the pinions growing

when underneath us was the stairway all
    run oer and we were on the highest step
    virgilius fastened upon me his eyes

and said the temporal fire and the eternal
    son thou hast seen and to a place art come
    where of myself no farther i discern

by intellect and art i here have brought thee
    take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth
    beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou

behold the sun that shines upon thy forehead
    behold the grass the flowerets and the shrubs
    which of itself alone this land produces

until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes
    which weeping caused me to come unto thee
    thou canst sit down and thou canst walk among them

expect no more or word or sign from me
    free and upright and sound is thy freewill
    and error were it not to do its bidding

thee oer thyself i therefore crown and mitre






eager already to search in and round
    the heavenly forest dense and livinggreen
    which tempered to the eyes the newborn day

withouten more delay i left the bank
    taking the level country slowly slowly
    over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance

a softlybreathing air that no mutation
    had in itself upon the forehead smote me
    no heavier blow than of a gentle wind

whereat the branches lightly tremulous
    did all of them bow downward toward that side
    where its first shadow casts the holy mountain

yet not from their upright direction swayed
    so that the little birds upon their tops
    should leave the practice of each art of theirs

but with full ravishment the hours of prime
    singing received they in the midst of leaves
    that ever bore a burden to their rhymes

such as from branch to branch goes gathering on
    through the pine forest on the shore of chiassi
    when eolus unlooses the sirocco

already my slow steps had carried me
    into the ancient wood so far that i
    could not perceive where i had entered it

and lo my further course a stream cut off
    which towrd the left hand with its little waves
    bent down the grass that on its margin sprang

all waters that on earth most limpid are
    would seem to have within themselves some mixture
    compared with that which nothing doth conceal

although it moves on with a brown brown current
    under the shade perpetual that never
    ray of the sun lets in nor of the moon

with feet i stayed and with mine eyes i passed
    beyond the rivulet to look upon
    the great variety of the fresh may

and there appeared to me 

a lady all alone who went along
    singing and culling floweret after floweret
    with which her pathway was all painted over

ah beauteous lady who in rays of love
    dost warm thyself if i may trust to looks
    which the hearts witnesses are wont to be

may the desire come unto thee to draw
    near to this rivers bank i said to her
    so much that i might hear what thou art singing

thou makest me remember where and what
    proserpina that moment was when lost
    her mother her and she herself the spring

as turns herself with feet together pressed
    and to the ground a lady who is dancing
    and hardly puts one foot before the other

on the vermilion and the yellow flowerets
    she turned towards me not in other wise
    than maiden who her modest eyes casts down

and my entreaties made to be content
    so near approaching that the dulcet sound
    came unto me together with its meaning

as soon as she was where the grasses are
    bathed by the waters of the beauteous river
    to lift her eyes she granted me the boon

i do not think there shone so great a light
    under the lids of venus when transfixed
    by her own son beyond his usual custom

erect upon the other bank she smiled
    bearing full many colours in her hands
    which that high land produces without seed

apart three paces did the river make us
    but hellespont where xerxes passed across
    

more hatred from leander did not suffer
    for rolling between sestos and abydos
    than that from me because it oped not then

ye are newcomers and because i smile
    began she peradventure in this place
    elect to human nature for its nest

some apprehension keeps you marvelling
    but the psalm delectasti giveth light
    which has the power to uncloud your intellect

and thou who foremost art and didst entreat me
    speak if thou wouldst hear more for i came ready
    to all thy questionings as far as needful

the water said i and the forests sound
    are combating within me my new faith
    in something which i heard opposed to this

whence she i will relate how from its cause
    proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder
    and purge away the cloud that smites upon thee

the good supreme sole in itself delighting
    created man good and this goodly place
    gave him as hansel of eternal peace

by his default short while he sojourned here
    by his default to weeping and to toil
    he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play

that the disturbance which below is made
    by exhalations of the land and water
    

might not upon mankind wage any war
    this mount ascended towrds the heaven so high
    and is exempt from there where it is locked

now since the universal atmosphere
    turns in a circuit with the primal motion
    unless the circle is broken on some side

upon this height that all is disengaged
    in living ether doth this motion strike
    and make the forest sound for it is dense

and so much power the stricken plant possesses
    that with its virtue it impregns the air
    and this revolving scatters it around

and yonder earth according as tis worthy
    in self or in its clime conceives and bears
    of divers qualities the divers trees

it should not seem a marvel then on earth
    this being heard whenever any plant
    without seed manifest there taketh root

and thou must know this holy tableland
    in which thou art is full of every seed
    and fruit has in it never gathered there

the water which thou seest springs not from vein
    restored by vapour that the cold condenses
    like to a stream that gains or loses breath

but issues from a fountain safe and certain
    which by the will of god as much regains
    as it discharges open on two sides

upon this side with virtue it descends
    which takes away all memory of sin
    on that of every good deed done restores it

here lethe as upon the other side
    eunoe it is called and worketh not
    if first on either side it be not tasted

this every other savour doth transcend
    and notwithstanding slaked so far may be
    thy thirst that i reveal to thee no more

ill give thee a corollary still in grace
    nor think my speech will be to thee less dear
    if it spread out beyond my promise to thee

those who in ancient times have feigned in song
    the age of gold and its felicity
    dreamed of this place perhaps upon parnassus

here was the human race in innocence
    here evermore was spring and every fruit
    this is the nectar of which each one speaks

then backward did i turn me wholly round
    unto my poets and saw that with a smile
    they had been listening to these closing words

then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes







singing like unto an enamoured lady
    she with the ending of her words continued
    beati quorum tecta sunt peccata

and even as nymphs that wandered all alone
    among the sylvan shadows sedulous
    one to avoid and one to see the sun

she then against the stream moved onward going
    along the bank and i abreast of her
    her little steps with little steps attending

between her steps and mine were not a hundred
    when equally the margins gave a turn
    in such a way that to the east i faced

nor even thus our way continued far
    before the lady wholly turned herself
    unto me saying brother look and listen

and lo a sudden lustre ran across
    on every side athwart the spacious forest
    such that it made me doubt if it were lightning

but since the lightning ceases as it comes
    and that continuing brightened more and more
    within my thought i said what thing is this

and a delicious melody there ran
    along the luminous air whence holy zeal
    made me rebuke the hardihood of eve

for there where earth and heaven obedient were
    the woman only and but just created
    could not endure to stay neath any veil

underneath which had she devoutly stayed
    i sooner should have tasted those delights
    ineffable and for a longer time

while mid such manifold firstfruits i walked
    of the eternal pleasure all enrapt
    and still solicitous of more delights

in front of us like an enkindled fire
    became the air beneath the verdant boughs
    and the sweet sound as singing now was heard

o virgins sacrosanct if ever hunger
    vigils or cold for you i have endured
    the occasion spurs me their reward to claim

now helicon must needs pour forth for me
    and with her choir urania must assist me
    to put in verse things difficult to think

a little farther on seven trees of gold
    in semblance the long space still intervening
    between ourselves and them did counterfeit

but when i had approached so near to them
    the common object which the sense deceives
    lost not by distance any of its marks

the faculty that lends discourse to reason
    did apprehend that they were candlesticks
    and in the voices of the song hosanna

above them flamed the harness beautiful
    far brighter than the moon in the serene
    of midnight at the middle of her month

i turned me round with admiration filled
    to good virgilius and he answered me
    with visage no less full of wonderment

then back i turned my face to those high things
    which moved themselves towards us so sedately
    they had been distanced by newwedded brides

the lady chid me why dost thou burn only
    so with affection for the living lights
    and dost not look at what comes after them

then saw i people as behind their leaders
    coming behind them garmented in white
    and such a whiteness never was on earth

the water on my left flank was resplendent
    and back to me reflected my left side
    een as a mirror if i looked therein

when i upon my margin had such post
    that nothing but the stream divided us
    better to see i gave my steps repose

and i beheld the flamelets onward go
    leaving behind themselves the air depicted
    and they of trailing pennons had the semblance

so that it overhead remained distinct
    with sevenfold lists all of them of the colours
    whence the suns bow is made and delias girdle

these standards to the rearward longer were
    than was my sight and as it seemed to me
    ten paces were the outermost apart

under so fair a heaven as i describe
    the four and twenty elders two by two
    came on incoronate with flowerdeluce

they all of them were singing blessed thou
    among the daughters of adam art and blessed
    for evermore shall be thy loveliness

after the flowers and other tender grasses
    in front of me upon the other margin
    were disencumbered of that race elect

even as in heaven star followeth after star
    there came close after them four animals
    incoronate each one with verdant leaf

plumed with six wings was every one of them
    the plumage full of eyes the eyes of argus
    if they were living would be such as these

reader to trace their forms no more i waste
    my rhymes for other spendings press me so
    that i in this cannot be prodigal

but read ezekiel who depicteth them
    as he beheld them from the region cold
    coming with cloud with whirlwind and with fire

and such as thou shalt find them in his pages
    such were they here saving that in their plumage
    john is with me and differeth from him

the interval between these four contained
    a chariot triumphal on two wheels
    which by a griffins neck came drawn along

and upward he extended both his wings
    between the middle list and three and three
    so that he injured none by cleaving it

so high they rose that they were lost to sight
    his limbs were gold so far as he was bird
    and white the others with vermilion mingled

not only rome with no such splendid car
    eer gladdened africanus or augustus
    but poor to it that of the sun would be

that of the sun which swerving was burnt up
    at the importunate orison of earth
    when jove was so mysteriously just

three maidens at the right wheel in a circle
    came onward dancing one so very red
    that in the fire she hardly had been noted

the second was as if her flesh and bones
    had all been fashioned out of emerald
    the third appeared as snow but newly fallen

and now they seemed conducted by the white
    now by the red and from the song of her
    the others took their step or slow or swift

upon the left hand four made holiday
    vested in purple following the measure
    of one of them with three eyes m her head

in rear of all the group here treated of
    two old men i beheld unlike in habit
    but like in gait each dignified and grave

one showed himself as one of the disciples
    of that supreme hippocrates whom nature
    made for the animals she holds most dear

contrary care the other manifested
    with sword so shining and so sharp it caused
    terror to me on this side of the river

thereafter four i saw of humble aspect
    and behind all an aged man alone
    walking in sleep with countenance acute

and like the foremost company these seven
    were habited yet of the flowerdeluce
    no garland round about the head they wore

but of the rose and other flowers vermilion
    at little distance would the sight have sworn
    that all were in a flame above their brows

and when the car was opposite to me
    thunder was heard and all that folk august
    seemed to have further progress interdicted

there with the vanward ensigns standing still







when the septentrion of the highest heaven
    

motionless halted the veracious people
    that came at first between it and the griffin
    turned themselves to the car as to their peace

and one of them as if by heaven commissioned
    singing veni sponsa de libano
    shouted three times and all the others after

even as the blessed at the final summons
    shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern
    uplifting light the reinvested flesh

so upon that celestial chariot
    a hundred rose ad vocem tanti senis
    ministers and messengers of life eternal

they all were saying benedictus qui venis
    and scattering flowers above and round about
    manibus o date lilia plenis

ere now have i beheld as day began
    the eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose
    and the other heaven with fair serene adorned

and the suns face uprising overshadowed
    so that by tempering influence of vapours
    for a long interval the eye sustained it

thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers
    which from those hands angelical ascended
    and downward fell again inside and out

over her snowwhite veil with olive cinct
    appeared a lady under a green mantle
    vested in colour of the living flame

and my own spirit that already now
    so long a time had been that in her presence
    trembling with awe it had not stood abashed

without more knowledge having by mine eyes
    through occult virtue that from her proceeded
    of ancient love the mighty influence felt

as soon as on my vision smote the power
    sublime that had already pierced me through
    ere from my boyhood i had yet come forth

to the left hand i turned with that reliance
    with which the little child runs to his mother
    when he has fear or when he is afflicted

to say unto virgilius not a drachm
    of blood remains in me that does not tremble
    i know the traces of the ancient flame

but us virgilius of himself deprived
    had left virgilius sweetest of all fathers
    virgilius to whom i for safety gave me

nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother
    availed my cheeks now purified from dew
    that weeping they should not again be darkened

dante because virgilius has departed
    do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile
    for by another sword thou needst must weep

een as an admiral who on poop and prow
    comes to behold the people that are working
    in other ships and cheers them to welldoing

upon the left hand border of the car
    when at the sound i turned of my own name
    which of necessity is here recorded

i saw the lady who erewhile appeared
    veiled underneath the angelic festival
    direct her eyes to me across the river

although the veil that from her head descended
    encircled with the foliage of minerva
    did not permit her to appear distinctly

in attitude still royally majestic
    continued she like unto one who speaks
    and keeps his warmest utterance in reserve

look at me well in sooth im beatrice
    how didst thou deign to come unto the mountain
    didst thou not know that man is happy here

mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain
    but seeing myself therein i sought the grass
    so great a shame did weigh my forehead down

as to the son the mother seems superb
    so she appeared to me for somewhat bitter
    tasteth the savour of severe compassion

silent became she and the angels sang
    suddenly in te domine speravi
    but beyond pedes meos did not pass

even as the snow among the living rafters
    upon the back of italy congeals
    blown on and drifted by sclavonian winds

and then dissolving trickles through itself
    wheneer the land that loses shadow breathes
    so that it seems a fire that melts a taper

een thus was i without a tear or sigh
    before the song of those who sing for ever
    after the music of the eternal spheres

but when i heard in their sweet melodies
    compassion for me more than had they said
    o wherefore lady dost thou thus upbraid him

the ice that was about my heart congealed
    to air and water changed and in my anguish
    through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast

she on the righthand border of the car
    still firmly standing to those holy beings
    thus her discourse directed afterwards

ye keep your watch in the eternal day
    so that nor night nor sleep can steal from you
    one step the ages make upon their path

therefore my answer is with greater care
    that he may hear me who is weeping yonder
    so that the sin and dole be of one measure

not only by the work of those great wheels
    that destine every seed unto some end
    according as the stars are in conjunction

but by the largess of celestial graces
    which have such lofty vapours for their rain
    that near to them our sight approaches not

such had this man become in his new life
    potentially that every righteous habit
    would have made admirable proof in him

but so much more malignant and more savage
    becomes the land untilled and with bad seed
    the more good earthly vigour it possesses

some time did i sustain him with my look
    revealing unto him my youthful eyes
    i led him with me turned in the right way

as soon as ever of my second age
    i was upon the threshold and changed life
    himself from me he took and gave to others

when from the flesh to spirit i ascended
    and beauty and virtue were in me increased
    i was to him less dear and less delightful

and into ways untrue he turned his steps
    pursuing the false images of good
    that never any promises fulfil

nor prayer for inspiration me availed
    by means of which in dreams and otherwise
    i called him back so little did he heed them

so low he fell that all appliances
    for his salvation were already short
    save showing him the people of perdition

for this i visited the gates of death
    and unto him who so far up has led him
    my intercessions were with weeping borne

gods lofty fiat would be violated
    if lethe should be passed and if such viands
    should tasted be withouten any scot

of penitence that gushes forth in tears







o thou who art beyond the sacred river
    turning to me the point of her discourse
    that edgewise even had seemed to me so keen

she recommenced continuing without pause
    say say if this be true to such a charge
    thy own confession needs must be conjoined

my faculties were in so great confusion
    that the voice moved but sooner was extinct
    than by its organs it was set at large

awhile she waited then she said what thinkest
    answer me for the mournful memories
    in thee not yet are by the waters injured

confusion and dismay together mingled
    forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight
    was needful to the understanding of it

even as a crossbow breaks when tis discharged
    too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow
    and with less force the arrow hits the mark

so i gave way beneath that heavy burden
    outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs
    and the voice flagged upon its passage forth

whence she to me in those desires of mine
    which led thee to the loving of that good
    beyond which there is nothing to aspire to

what trenches lying traverse or what chains
    didst thou discover that of passing onward
    thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope

and what allurements or what vantages
    upon the forehead of the others showed
    that thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them

after the heaving of a bitter sigh
    hardly had i the voice to make response
    and with fatigue my lips did fashion it

weeping i said the things that present were
    with their false pleasure turned aside my steps
    soon as your countenance concealed itself

and she shouldst thou be silent or deny
    what thou confessest not less manifest
    would be thy fault by such a judge tis known

but when from ones own cheeks comes bursting forth
    the accusal of the sin in our tribunal
    against the edge the wheel doth turn itself

but still that thou mayst feel a greater shame
    for thy transgression and another time
    hearing the sirens thou mayst be more strong

cast down the seed of weeping and attend
    so shalt thou hear how in an opposite way
    my buried flesh should have directed thee

never to thee presented art or nature
    pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein
    i was enclosed which scattered are in earth

and if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee
    by reason of my death what mortal thing
    should then have drawn thee into its desire

thou oughtest verily at the first shaft
    of things fallacious to have risen up
    to follow me who was no longer such

thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward
    to wait for further blows or little girl
    or other vanity of such brief use

the callow birdlet waits for two or three
    but to the eyes of those already fledged
    in vain the net is spread or shaft is shot

even as children silent in their shame
    stand listening with their eyes upon the ground
    and conscious of their fault and penitent

so was i standing and she said if thou
    in hearing sufferest pain lift up thy beard
    and thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing

with less resistance is a robust holm
    uprooted either by a native wind
    or else by that from regions of iarbas

than i upraised at her command my chin
    and when she by the beard the face demanded
    well i perceived the venom of her meaning

and as my countenance was lifted up
    mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful
    had rested from the strewing of the flowers

and still but little reassured mine eyes
    saw beatrice turned round towards the monster
    that is one person only in two natures

beneath her veil beyond the margent green
    she seemed to me far more her ancient self
    to excel than others here when she was here

so pricked me then the thorn of penitence
    that of all other things the one which turned me
    most to its love became the most my foe

such selfconviction stung me at the heart
    oerpowered i fell and what i then became
    she knoweth who had furnished me the cause

then when the heart restored my outward sense
    the lady i had found alone above me
    i saw and she was saying hold me hold me

up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me
    and dragging me behind her she was moving
    upon the water lightly as a shuttle

when i was near unto the blessed shore
    asperges me i heard so sweetly sung
    remember it i cannot much less write it

the beautiful lady opened wide her arms
    embraced my head and plunged me underneath
    where i was forced to swallow of the water

then forth she drew me and all dripping brought
    into the dance of the four beautiful
    and each one with her arm did cover me

we here are nymphs and in the heaven are stars
    ere beatrice descended to the world
    we as her handmaids were appointed her

well lead thee to her eyes but for the pleasant
    light that within them is shall sharpen thine
    the three beyond who more profoundly look

thus singing they began and afterwards
    unto the griffins breast they led me with them
    where beatrice was standing turned towards us

see that thou dost not spare thine eyes they said
    before the emeralds have we stationed thee
    whence love aforetime drew for thee his weapons

a thousand longings hotter than the flame
    fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent
    that still upon the griffin steadfast stayed

as in a glass the sun not otherwise
    within them was the twofold monster shining
    now with the one now with the other nature

think reader if within myself i marvelled
    when i beheld the thing itself stand still
    and in its image it transformed itself

while with amazement filled and jubilant
    my soul was tasting of the food that while
    it satisfies us makes us hunger for it

themselves revealing of the highest rank
    in bearing did the other three advance
    singing to their angelic saraband

turn beatrice o turn thy holy eyes
    such was their song unto thy faithful one
    who has to see thee taen so many steps

in grace do us the grace that thou unveil
    thy face to him so that he may discern
    the second beauty which thou dost conceal

o splendour of the living light eternal
    who underneath the shadow of parnassus
    has grown so pale or drunk so at its cistern

he would not seem to have his mind encumbered
    striving to paint thee as thou didst appear
    where the harmonious heaven oershadowed thee

when in the open air thou didst unveil







so steadfast and attentive were mine eyes
    in satisfying their decennial thirst
    that all my other senses were extinct

and upon this side and on that they had
    walls of indifference so the holy smile
    drew them unto itself with the old net

when forcibly my sight was turned away
    towards my left hand by those goddesses
    because i heard from them a too intently

and that condition of the sight which is
    in eyes but lately smitten by the sun
    bereft me of my vision some short while

but to the less when sight reshaped itself
    i say the less in reference to the greater
    splendour from which perforce i had withdrawn

i saw upon its right wing wheeled about
    the glorious host returning with the sun
    and with the sevenfold flames upon their faces

as underneath its shields to save itself
    a squadron turns and with its banner wheels
    before the whole thereof can change its front

that soldiery of the celestial kingdom
    which marched in the advance had wholly passed us
    before the chariot had turned its pole

then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves
    and the griffin moved his burden benedight
    but so that not a feather of him fluttered

the lady fair who drew me through the ford
    followed with statius and myself the wheel
    which made its orbit with the lesser arc

so passing through the lofty forest vacant
    by fault of her who in the serpent trusted
    angelic music made our steps keep time

perchance as great a space had in three flights
    an arrow loosened from the string oerpassed
    as we had moved when beatrice descended

i heard them murmur altogether adam
    then circled they about a tree despoiled
    of blooms and other leafage on each bough

its tresses which so much the more dilate
    as higher they ascend had been by indians
    among their forests marvelled at for height

blessed art thou o griffin who dost not
    pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste
    since appetite by this was turned to evil

after this fashion round the tree robust
    the others shouted and the twofold creature
    thus is preserved the seed of all the just

and turning to the pole which he had dragged
    he drew it close beneath the widowed bough
    and what was of it unto it left bound

in the same manner as our trees 

begin to swell and then renew themselves
    each one with its own colour ere the sun
    harness his steeds beneath another star

less than of rose and more than violet
    a hue disclosing was renewed the tree
    that had erewhile its boughs so desolate

i never heard nor here below is sung
    the hymn which afterward that people sang
    nor did i bear the melody throughout

had i the power to paint how fell asleep
    those eyes compassionless of syrinx hearing
    those eyes to which more watching cost so dear

even as a painter who from model paints
    i would portray how i was lulled asleep
    he may who well can picture drowsihood

therefore i pass to what time i awoke
    and say a splendour rent from me the veil
    of slumber and a calling rise what dost thou

as to behold the appletree in blossom
    which makes the angels greedy for its fruit
    and keeps perpetual bridals in the heaven

peter and john and james conducted were
    and overcome recovered at the word
    by which still greater slumbers have been broken

and saw their school diminished by the loss
    not only of elias but of moses
    and the apparel of their master changed

so i revived and saw that piteous one
    above me standing who had been conductress
    aforetime of my steps beside the river

and all in doubt i said wheres beatrice
    and she behold her seated underneath
    the leafage new upon the root of it

behold the company that circles her
    the rest behind the griffin are ascending
    with more melodious song and more profound

and if her speech were more diffuse i know not
    because already in my sight was she
    who from the hearing of aught else had shut me

alone she sat upon the very earth
    left there as guardian of the chariot
    which i had seen the biform monster fasten

encircling her a cloister made themselves
    the seven nymphs with those lights in their hands
    which are secure from aquilon and auster

short while shalt thou be here a forester
    and thou shalt be with me for evermore
    a citizen of that rome where christ is roman

therefore for that worlds good which liveth ill
    fix on the car thine eyes and what thou seest
    having returned to earth take heed thou write

thus beatrice and i who at the feet
    of her commandments all devoted was
    my mind and eyes directed where she willed

never descended with so swift a motion
    fire from a heavy cloud when it is raining
    from out the region which is most remote

as i beheld the bird of jove descend
    down through the tree rending away the bark
    as well as blossoms and the foliage new

and he with all his might the chariot smote
    whereat it reeled like vessel in a tempest
    tossed by the waves now starboard and now larboard

thereafter saw i leap into the body
    of the triumphal vehicle a fox
    that seemed unfed with any wholesome food

but for his hideous sins upbraiding him
    my lady put him to as swift a flight
    as such a fleshless skeleton could bear

then by the way that it before had come
    into the chariots chest i saw the eagle
    descend and leave it feathered with his plumes

and such as issues from a heart that mourns
    a voice from heaven there issued and it said
    my little bark how badly art thou freighted

methought then that the earth did yawn between
    both wheels and i saw rise from it a dragon
    who through the chariot upward fixed his tail

and as a wasp that draweth back its sting
    drawing unto himself his tail malign
    drew out the floor and went his way rejoicing

that which remained behind even as with grass
    a fertile region with the feathers offered
    perhaps with pure intention and benign

reclothed itself and with them were reclothed
    the pole and both the wheels so speedily
    a sigh doth longer keep the lips apart

transfigured thus the holy edifice
    thrust forward heads upon the parts of it
    three on the pole and one at either corner

the first were horned like oxen but the four
    had but a single horn upon the forehead
    a monster such had never yet been seen

firm as a rock upon a mountain high
    seated upon it there appeared to me
    a shameless whore with eyes swift glancing round

and as if not to have her taken from him
    upright beside her i beheld a giant
    and ever and anon they kissed each other

but because she her wanton roving eye
    turned upon me her angry paramour
    did scourge her from her head unto her feet

then full of jealousy and fierce with wrath
    he loosed the monster and across the forest
    dragged it so far he made of that alone

a shield unto the whore and the strange beast






deus venerunt gentes alternating
    now three now four melodious psalmody
    the maidens in the midst of tears began

and beatrice compassionate and sighing
    listened to them with such a countenance
    that scarce more changed was mary at the cross

but when the other virgins place had given
    for her to speak uprisen to her feet
    with colour as of fire she made response

modicum et non videbitis me
    et iterum my sisters predilect
    modicum et vos videbitis me

then all the seven in front of her she placed
    and after her by beckoning only moved
    me and the lady and the sage who stayed

so she moved onward and i do not think
    that her tenth step was placed upon the ground
    when with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote

and with a tranquil aspect come more quickly
    to me she said that if i speak with thee
    to listen to me thou mayst be well placed

as soon as i was with her as i should be
    she said to me why brother dost thou not
    venture to question now in coming with me

as unto those who are too reverential
    speaking in presence of superiors
    who drag no living utterance to their teeth

it me befell that without perfect sound
    began i my necessity madonna
    you know and that which thereunto is good

and she to me of fear and bashfulness
    henceforward i will have thee strip thyself
    so that thou speak no more as one who dreams

know that the vessel which the serpent broke
    was and is not but let him who is guilty
    think that gods vengeance does not fear a sop

without an heir shall not for ever be
    the eagle that left his plumes upon the car
    whence it became a monster then a prey

for verily i see and hence narrate it
    the stars already near to bring the time
    from every hindrance safe and every bar

within which a fivehundred ten and five
    one sent from god shall slay the thievish woman
    and that same giant who is sinning with her

and peradventure my dark utterance
    like themis and the sphinx may less persuade thee
    since in their mode it clouds the intellect

but soon the facts shall be the naiades
    who shall this difficult enigma solve
    without destruction of the flocks and harvests

note thou and even as by me are uttered
    these words so teach them unto those who live
    that life which is a running unto death

and bear in mind wheneer thou writest them
    not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant
    that twice already has been pillaged here

whoever pillages or shatters it
    with blasphemy of deed offendeth god
    who made it holy for his use alone

for biting that in pain and in desire
    five thousand years and more the firstborn soul
    craved him who punished in himself the bite

thy genius slumbers if it deem it not
    for special reason so preeminent
    in height and so inverted in its summit

and if thy vain imaginings had not been
    water of elsa round about thy mind
    and pyramus to the mulberry their pleasure

thou by so many circumstances only
    the justice of the interdict of god
    morally in the tree wouldst recognize

but since i see thee in thine intellect
    converted into stone and stained with sin
    so that the light of my discourse doth daze thee

i will too if not written at least painted
    thou bear it back within thee for the reason
    that cinct with palm the pilgrims staff is borne

and i as by a signet is the wax
    which does not change the figure stamped upon it
    my brain is now imprinted by yourself

but wherefore so beyond my power of sight
    soars your desirable discourse that aye
    the more i strive so much the more i lose it

that thou mayst recognize she said the school
    which thou hast followed and mayst see how far
    its doctrine follows after my discourse

and mayst behold your path from the divine
    distant as far as separated is
    from earth the heaven that highest hastens on

whence her i answered i do not remember
    that ever i estranged myself from you
    nor have i conscience of it that reproves me

and if thou art not able to remember
    smiling she answered recollect thee now
    that thou this very day hast drunk of lethe

and if from smoke a fire may be inferred
    such an oblivion clearly demonstrates
    some error in thy will elsewhere intent

truly from this time forward shall my words
    be naked so far as it is befitting
    to lay them open unto thy rude gaze

and more coruscant and with slower steps
    the sun was holding the meridian circle
    which with the point of view shifts here and there

when halted 

the ladies seven at a dark shadows edge
    such as beneath green leaves and branches black
    the alp upon its frigid border wears

in front of them the tigris and euphrates
    methought i saw forth issue from one fountain
    and slowly part like friends from one another

o light o glory of the human race
    what stream is this which here unfolds itself
    from out one source and from itself withdraws

for such a prayer twas said unto me pray
    matilda that she tell thee and here answered
    as one does who doth free himself from blame

the beautiful lady this and other things
    were told to him by me and sure i am
    the water of lethe has not hid them from him

and beatrice perhaps a greater care
    which oftentimes our memory takes away
    has made the vision of his mind obscure

but eunoe behold that yonder rises
    lead him to it and as thou art accustomed
    revive again the halfdead virtue in him

like gentle soul that maketh no excuse
    but makes its own will of anothers will
    as soon as by a sign it is disclosed

even so when she had taken hold of me
    the beautiful lady moved and unto statius
    said in her womanly manner come with him

if reader i possessed a longer space
    for writing it i yet would sing in part
    of the sweet draught that neer would satiate me

but inasmuch as full are all the leaves
    made ready for this second canticle
    the curb of art no farther lets me go

from the most holy water i returned
    regenerate in the manner of new trees
    that are renewed with a new foliage

pure and disposed to mount unto the stars











the glory of him who moveth everything
    doth penetrate the universe and shine
    in one part more and in another less

within that heaven which most his light receives
    was i and things beheld which to repeat
    nor knows nor can who from above descends

because in drawing near to its desire
    our intellect ingulphs itself so far
    that after it the memory cannot go

truly whatever of the holy realm
    i had the power to treasure in my mind
    shall now become the subject of my song

o good apollo for this last emprise
    make of me such a vessel of thy power
    as giving the beloved laurel asks

one summit of parnassus hitherto
    has been enough for me but now with both
    i needs must enter the arena left

enter into my bosom thou and breathe
    as at the time when marsyas thou didst draw
    out of the scabbard of those limbs of his

o power divine lendst thou thyself to me
    so that the shadow of the blessed realm
    stamped in my brain i can make manifest

thoult see me come unto thy darling tree
    and crown myself thereafter with those leaves
    of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy

so seldom father do we gather them
    for triumph or of caesar or of poet
    

that the peneian foliage should bring forth
    joy to the joyous delphic deity
    when any one it makes to thirst for it

a little spark is followed by great flame
    perchance with better voices after me
    shall prayer be made that cyrrha may respond

to mortal men by passages diverse
    uprises the worlds lamp but by that one
    which circles four uniteth with three crosses

with better course and with a better star
    conjoined it issues and the mundane wax
    tempers and stamps more after its own fashion

almost that passage had made morning there
    and evening here and there was wholly white
    that hemisphere and black the other part

when beatrice towards the lefthand side
    i saw turned round and gazing at the sun
    never did eagle fasten so upon it

and even as a second ray is wont
    to issue from the first and reascend
    like to a pilgrim who would fain return

thus of her action through the eyes infused
    in my imagination mine i made
    and sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont

there much is lawful which is here unlawful
    unto our powers by virtue of the place
    made for the human species as its own

not long i bore it nor so little while
    but i beheld it sparkle round about
    like iron that comes molten from the fire

and suddenly it seemed that day to day
    was added as if he who has the power
    had with another sun the heaven adorned

with eyes upon the everlasting wheels
    stood beatrice all intent and i on her
    fixing my vision from above removed

such at her aspect inwardly became
    as glaucus tasting of the herb that made him
    peer of the other gods beneath the sea

to represent transhumanise in words
    impossible were the example then suffice
    him for whom grace the experience reserves

if i was merely what of me thou newly
    createdst love who governest the heaven
    thou knowest who didst lift me with thy light

when now the wheel which thou dost make eternal
    desiring thee made me attentive to it
    by harmony thou dost modulate and measure

then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled
    by the suns flame that neither rain nor river
    eer made a lake so widely spread abroad

the newness of the sound and the great light
    kindled in me a longing for their cause
    never before with such acuteness felt

whence she who saw me as i saw myself
    to quiet in me my perturbed mind
    opened her mouth ere i did mine to ask

and she began thou makest thyself so dull
    with false imagining that thou seest not
    what thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off

thou art not upon earth as thou believest
    but lightning fleeing its appropriate site
    neer ran as thou who thitherward returnest

if of my former doubt i was divested
    by these brief little words more smiled than spoken
    i in a new one was the more ensnared

and said already did i rest content
    from great amazement but am now amazed
    in what way i transcend these bodies light

whereupon she after a pitying sigh
    her eyes directed towrds me with that look
    a mother casts on a delirious child

and she began all things whateer they be
    have order among themselves and this is form
    that makes the universe resemble god

here do the higher creatures see the footprints
    of the eternal power which is the end
    whereto is made the law already mentioned

in the order that i speak of are inclined
    all natures by their destinies diverse
    more or less near unto their origin

hence they move onward unto ports diverse
    oer the great sea of being and each one
    with instinct given it which bears it on

this bears away the fire towards the moon
    this is in mortal hearts the motive power
    this binds together and unites the earth

nor only the created things that are
    without intelligence this bow shoots forth
    but those that have both intellect and love

the providence that regulates all this
    makes with its light the heaven forever quiet
    wherein that turns which has the greatest haste

and thither now as to a site decreed
    bears us away the virtue of that cord
    which aims its arrows at a joyous mark

true is it that as oftentimes the form
    accords not with the intention of the art
    because in answering is matter deaf

so likewise from this course doth deviate
    sometimes the creature who the power possesses
    though thus impelled to swerve some other way

 if the first impetus
    earthward is wrested by some false delight

thou shouldst not wonder more if well i judge
    at thine ascent than at a rivulet
    from some high mount descending to the lowland

marvel it would be in thee if deprived
    of hindrance thou wert seated down below
    as if on earth the living fire were quiet

thereat she heavenward turned again her face







o ye who in some pretty little boat
    eager to listen have been following
    behind my ship that singing sails along

turn back to look again upon your shores
    do not put out to sea lest peradventure
    in losing me you might yourselves be lost

the sea i sail has never yet been passed
    minerva breathes and pilots me apollo
    and muses nine point out to me the bears

ye other few who have the neck uplifted
    betimes to th bread of angels upon which
    one liveth here and grows not sated by it

well may you launch upon the deep saltsea
    your vessel keeping still my wake before you
    upon the water that grows smooth again

those glorious ones who unto colchos passed
    were not so wonderstruck as you shall be
    when jason they beheld a ploughman made

the concreated and perpetual thirst
    for the realm deiform did bear us on
    as swift almost as ye the heavens behold

upward gazed beatrice and i at her
    and in such space perchance as strikes a bolt
    and flies and from the notch unlocks itself

arrived i saw me where a wondrous thing
    drew to itself my sight and therefore she
    from whom no care of mine could be concealed

towards me turning blithe as beautiful
    said unto me fix gratefully thy mind
    on god who unto the first star has brought us

it seemed to me a cloud encompassed us
    luminous dense consolidate and bright
    as adamant on which the sun is striking

into itself did the eternal pearl
    receive us even as water doth receive
    a ray of light remaining still unbroken

if i was body 

more the desire should be enkindled in us
    that essence to behold wherein is seen
    how god and our own nature were united

there will be seen what we receive by faith
    not demonstrated but selfevident
    in guise of the first truth that man believes

i made reply madonna as devoutly
    as most i can do i give thanks to him
    who has removed me from the mortal world

but tell me what the dusky spots may be
    upon this body which below on earth
    make people tell that fabulous tale of cain

somewhat she smiled and then if the opinion
    of mortals be erroneous she said
    whereer the key of sense doth not unlock

certes the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee
    now forasmuch as following the senses
    thou seest that the reason has short wings

but tell me what thou thinkst of it thyself
    and i what seems to us up here diverse
    is caused i think by bodies rare and dense

and she right truly shalt thou see immersed
    in error thy belief if well thou hearest
    the argument that i shall make against it

lights many the eighth sphere displays to you
    which in their quality and quantity
    may noted be of aspects different

if this were caused by rare and dense alone
    one only virtue would there be in all
    or more or less diffused or equally

virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits
    of formal principles and these save one
    of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed

besides if rarity were of this dimness
    the cause thou askest either through and through
    this planet thus attenuate were of matter

or else as in a body is apportioned
    the fat and lean so in like manner this
    would in its volume interchange the leaves

were it the former in the suns eclipse
    it would be manifest by the shining through
    of light as through aught tenuous interfused

this is not so hence we must scan the other
    and if it chance the other i demolish
    then falsified will thy opinion be

but if this rarity go not through and through
    there needs must be a limit beyond which
    its contrary prevents the further passing

and thence the foreign radiance is reflected
    even as a colour cometh back from glass
    the which behind itself concealeth lead

now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself
    more dimly there than in the other parts
    by being there reflected farther back

from this reply experiment will free thee
    if eer thou try it which is wont to be
    the fountain to the rivers of your arts

three mirrors shalt thou take and two remove
    alike from thee the other more remote
    between the former two shall meet thine eyes

turned towards these cause that behind thy back
    be placed a light illuming the three mirrors
    and coming back to thee by all reflected

though in its quantity be not so ample
    the image most remote there shalt thou see
    how it perforce is equally resplendent

now as beneath the touches of warm rays
    naked the subject of the snow remains
    both of its former colour and its cold

thee thus remaining in thy intellect
    will i inform with such a living light
    that it shall tremble in its aspect to thee

within the heaven of the divine repose
    revolves a body in whose virtue lies
    the being of whatever it contains

the following heaven that has so many eyes
    divides this being by essences diverse
    distinguished from it and by it contained

the other spheres by various differences
    all the distinctions which they have within them
    dispose unto their ends and their effects

thus do these organs of the world proceed
    as thou perceivest now from grade to grade
    since from above they take and act beneath

observe me well how through this place i come
    unto the truth thou wishest that hereafter
    thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford

the power and motion of the holy spheres
    as from the artisan the hammers craft
    forth from the blessed motors must proceed

the heaven which lights so manifold make fair
    from the intelligence profound which turns it
    the image takes and makes of it a seal

and even as the soul within your dust
    through members different and accommodated
    to faculties diverse expands itself

so likewise this intelligence diffuses
    its virtue multiplied among the stars
    itself revolving on its unity

virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage
    make with the precious body that it quickens
    in which as life in you it is combined

from the glad nature whence it is derived
    the mingled virtue through the body shines
    even as gladness through the living pupil

from this proceeds whateer from light to light
    appeareth different not from dense and rare
    this is the formal principle that produces

according to its goodness dark and bright







that sun which erst with love my bosom warmed
    of beauteous truth had unto me discovered
    by proving and reproving the sweet aspect

and that i might confess myself convinced
    and confident so far as was befitting
    i lifted more erect my head to speak

but there appeared a vision which withdrew me
    so close to it in order to be seen
    that my confession i remembered not

such as through polished and transparent glass
    or waters crystalline and undisturbed
    but not so deep as that their bed be lost

come back again the outlines of our faces
    so feeble that a pearl on forehead white
    comes not less speedily unto our eyes

such saw i many faces prompt to speak
    so that i ran in error opposite
    to that which kindled love twixt man and fountain

as soon as i became aware of them
    esteeming them as mirrored semblances
    to see of whom they were mine eyes i turned

and nothing saw and once more turned them forward
    direct into the light of my sweet guide
    who smiling kindled in her holy eyes

marvel thou not she said to me because
    i smile at this thy puerile conceit
    since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot

but turns thee as tis wont on emptiness
    true substances are these which thou beholdest
    here relegate for breaking of some vow

therefore speak with them listen and believe
    for the true light which giveth peace to them
    permits them not to turn from it their feet

and i unto the shade that seemed most wishful
    to speak directed me and i began
    as one whom too great eagerness bewilders

o wellcreated spirit who in the rays
    of life eternal dost the sweetness taste
    which being untasted neer is comprehended

grateful twill be to me if thou content me
    both with thy name and with your destiny
    whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes

our charity doth never shut the doors
    against a just desire except as one
    who wills that all her court be like herself

i was a virgin sister in the world
    and if thy mind doth contemplate me well
    the being more fair will not conceal me from thee

but thou shalt recognise i am piccarda
    who stationed here among these other blessed
    myself am blessed in the slowest sphere

all our affections that alone inflamed
    are in the pleasure of the holy ghost
    rejoice at being of his order formed

and this allotment which appears so low
    therefore is given us because our vows
    have been neglected and in some part void

whence i to her in your miraculous aspects
    there shines i know not what of the divine
    which doth transform you from our first conceptions

therefore i was not swift in my remembrance
    but what thou tellest me now aids me so
    that the refiguring is easier to me

but tell me ye who in this place are happy
    are you desirous of a higher place
    to see more or to make yourselves more friends

first with those other shades she smiled a little
    thereafter answered me so full of gladness
    she seemed to burn in the first fire of love

brother our will is quieted by virtue
    of charity that makes us wish alone
    for what we have nor gives us thirst for more

if to be more exalted we aspired
    discordant would our aspirations be
    unto the will of him who here secludes us

which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles
    if being in charity is needful here
    and if thou lookest well into its nature

nay tis essential to this blest existence
    to keep itself within the will divine
    whereby our very wishes are made one

so that as we are station above station
    throughout this realm to all the realm tis pleasing
    as to the king who makes his will our will

and his will is our peace this is the sea
    to which is moving onward whatsoever
    it doth create and all that nature makes

then it was clear to me how everywhere
    in heaven is paradise although the grace
    of good supreme there rain not in one measure

but as it comes to pass if one food sates
    and for another still remains the longing
    we ask for this and that decline with thanks

een thus did i with gesture and with word
    to learn from her what was the web wherein
    she did not ply the shuttle to the end

a perfect life and merit high inheaven
    a lady oer us said she by whose rule
    down in your world they vest and veil themselves

that until death they may both watch and sleep
    beside that spouse who every vow accepts
    which charity conformeth to his pleasure

to follow her in girlhood from the world
    i fled and in her habit shut myself
    and pledged me to the pathway of her sect

then men accustomed unto evil more
    than unto good from the sweet cloister tore me
    god knows what afterward my life became

this other splendour which to thee reveals
    itself on my right side and is enkindled
    with all the illumination of our sphere

what of myself i say applies to her
    a nun was she and likewise from her head
    was taen the shadow of the sacred wimple

but when she too was to the world returned
    against her wishes and against good usage
    of the hearts veil she never was divested

of great costanza this is the effulgence
    who from the second wind of suabia
    brought forth the third and latest puissance

thus unto me she spake and then began
    ave maria singing and in singing
    vanished as through deep water something heavy

my sight that followed her as long a time
    as it was possible when it had lost her
    turned round unto the mark of more desire

and wholly unto beatrice reverted
    but she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes
    that at the first my sight endured it not

and this in questioning more backward made me







between two viands equally removed
    and tempting a free man would die of hunger
    ere either he could bring unto his teeth

so would a lamb between the ravenings
    of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike
    and so would stand a dog between two does

hence if i held my peace myself i blame not
    impelled in equal measure by my doubts
    since it must be so nor do i commend

i held my peace but my desire was painted
    upon my face and questioning with that
    more fervent far than by articulate speech

beatrice did as daniel had done
    relieving nebuchadnezzar from the wrath
    which rendered him unjustly merciless

and said well see i how attracteth thee
    one and the other wish so that thy care
    binds itself so that forth it does not breathe

thou arguest if good will be permanent
    the violence of others for what reason
    doth it decrease the measure of my merit

again for doubting furnish thee occasion
    souls seeming to return unto the stars
    according to the sentiment of plato

these are the questions which upon thy wish
    are thrusting equally and therefore first
    will i treat that which hath the most of gall

he of the seraphim most absorbed in god
    moses and samuel and whichever john
    thou mayst select i say and even mary

have not in any other heaven their seats
    than have those spirits that just appeared to thee
    nor of existence more or fewer years

but all make beautiful the primal circle
    and have sweet life in different degrees
    by feeling more or less the eternal breath

they showed themselves here not because allotted
    this sphere has been to them but to give sign
    of the celestial which is least exalted

to speak thus is adapted to your mind
    since only through the sense it apprehendeth
    what then it worthy makes of intellect

on this account the scripture condescends
    unto your faculties and feet and hands
    to god attributes and means something else

and holy church under an aspect human
    gabriel and michael represent to you
    and him who made tobias whole again

that which timaeus argues of the soul
    doth not resemble that which here is seen
    because it seems that as he speaks he thinks

he says the soul unto its star returns
    believing it to have been severed thence
    whenever nature gave it as a form

perhaps his doctrine is of other guise
    than the words sound and possibly may be
    with meaning that is not to be derided

if he doth mean that to these wheels return
    the honour of their influence and the blame
    perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth

this principle ill understood once warped
    the whole world nearly till it went astray
    invoking jove and mercury and mars

the other doubt which doth disquiet thee
    less venom has for its malevolence
    could never lead thee otherwhere from me

that as unjust our justice should appear
    in eyes of mortals is an argument
    of faith and not of sin heretical

but still that your perception may be able
    to thoroughly penetrate this verity
    as thou desirest i will satisfy thee

if it be violence when he who suffers
    cooperates not with him who uses force
    these souls were not on that account excused

for will is never quenched unless it will
    but operates as nature doth in fire
    if violence a thousand times distort it

hence if it yieldeth more or less it seconds
    the force and these have done so having power
    of turning back unto the holy place

if their will had been perfect like to that
    which lawrence fast upon his gridiron held
    and mutius made severe to his own hand

it would have urged them back along the road
    whence they were dragged as soon as they were free
    but such a solid will is all too rare

and by these words if thou hast gathered them
    as thou shouldst do the argument is refuted
    that would have still annoyed thee many times

but now another passage runs across
    before thine eyes and such that by thyself
    thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary

i have for certain put into thy mind
    that soul beatified could never lie
    for it is near the primal truth

and then thou from piccarda mightst have heard
    costanza kept affection for the veil
    so that she seemeth here to contradict me

many times brother has it come to pass
    that to escape from peril with reluctance
    that has been done it was not right to do

een as alcmaeon 
    not to lose pity pitiless became

at this point i desire thee to remember
    that force with will commingles and they cause
    that the offences cannot be excused

will absolute consenteth not to evil
    but in so far consenteth as it fears
    if it refrain to fall into more harm

hence when piccarda uses this expression
    she meaneth the will absolute and i
    the other so that both of us speak truth

such was the flowing of the holy river
    that issued from the fount whence springs all truth
    this put to rest my wishes one and all

o love of the first lover o divine
    said i forthwith whose speech inundates me
    and warms me so it more and more revives me

my own affection is not so profound
    as to suffice in rendering grace for grace
    let him who sees and can thereto respond

well i perceive that never sated is
    our intellect unless the truth illume it
    beyond which nothing true expands itself

it rests therein as wild beast in his lair
    when it attains it and it can attain it
    if not then each desire would frustrate be

therefore springs up in fashion of a shoot
    doubt at the foot of truth and this is nature
    which to the top from height to height impels us

this doth invite me this assurance give me
    with reverence lady to inquire of you
    another truth which is obscure to me

i wish to know if man can satisfy you
    for broken vows with other good deeds so
    that in your balance they will not be light

beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes
    full of the sparks of love and so divine
    that overcome my power i turned my back

and almost lost myself with eyes downcast







if in the heat of love i flame upon thee
    beyond the measure that on earth is seen
    so that the valour of thine eyes i vanquish

marvel thou not thereat for this proceeds
    from perfect sight which as it apprehends
    to the good apprehended moves its feet

well i perceive how is already shining
    into thine intellect the eternal light
    that only seen enkindles always love

and if some other thing your love seduce
    tis nothing but a vestige of the same
    ill understood which there is shining through

thou fain wouldst know if with another service
    for broken vow can such return be made
    as to secure the soul from further claim

this canto thus did beatrice begin
    and as a man who breaks not off his speech
    continued thus her holy argument

the greatest gift that in his largess god
    creating made and unto his own goodness
    nearest conformed and that which he doth prize

most highly is the freedom of the will
    wherewith the creatures of intelligence
    both all and only were and are endowed

now wilt thou see if thence thou reasonest
    the high worth of a vow if it he made
    so that when thou consentest god consents

for closing between god and man the compact
    a sacrifice is of this treasure made
    such as i say and made by its own act

what can be rendered then as compensation
    thinkst thou to make good use of what thoust offered
    with gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed

now art thou certain of the greater point
    but because holy church in this dispenses
    which seems against the truth which i have shown thee

behoves thee still to sit awhile at table
    because the solid food which thou hast taken
    requireth further aid for thy digestion

open thy mind to that which i reveal
    and fix it there within for tis not knowledge
    the having heard without retaining it

in the essence of this sacrifice two things
    convene together and the one is that
    of which tis made the other is the agreement

this last for evermore is cancelled not
    unless complied with and concerning this
    with such precision has above been spoken

therefore it was enjoined upon the hebrews
    to offer still though sometimes what was offered
    might be commuted as thou oughtst to know

the other which is known to thee as matter
    may well indeed be such that one errs not
    if it for other matter be exchanged

but let none shift the burden on his shoulder
    at his arbitrament without the turning
    both of the white and of the yellow key

and every permutation deem as foolish
    if in the substitute the thing relinquished
    as the four is in six be not contained

therefore whatever thing has so great weight
    in value that it drags down every balance
    cannot be satisfied with other spending

let mortals never take a vow in jest
    be faithful and not blind in doing that
    as jephthah was in his first offering

whom more beseemed to say i have done wrong
    than to do worse by keeping and as foolish
    thou the great leader of the greeks wilt find

whence wept iphigenia her fair face
    and made for her both wise and simple weep
    who heard such kind of worship spoken of

christians be ye more serious in your movements
    be ye not like a feather at each wind
    and think not every water washes you

ye have the old and the new testament
    and the pastor of the church who guideth you
    let this suffice you unto your salvation

if evil appetite cry aught else to you
    be ye as men and not as silly sheep
    so that the jew among you may not mock you

be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon
    its mothers milk and frolicsome and simple
    combats at its own pleasure with itself

thus beatrice to me even as i write it
    then all desireful turned herself again
    to that part where the world is most alive

her silence and her change of countenance
    silence imposed upon my eager mind
    that had already in advance new questions

and as an arrow that upon the mark
    strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become
    so did we speed into the second realm

my lady there so joyful i beheld
    as into the brightness of that heaven she entered
    more luminous thereat the planet grew

and if the star itself was changed and smiled
    what became i who by my nature am
    exceeding mutable in every guise

as in a fishpond which is pure and tranquil
    the fishes draw to that which from without
    comes in such fashion that their food they deem it

so i beheld more than a thousand splendours
    drawing towards us and in each was heard
    lo this is she who shall increase our love

and as each one was coming unto us
    full of beatitude the shade was seen
    by the effulgence clear that issued from it

think reader if what here is just beginning
    no farther should proceed how thou wouldst have
    an agonizing need of knowing more

and of thyself thoult see how i from these
    was in desire of hearing their conditions
    as they unto mine eyes were manifest

o thou wellborn unto whom grace concedes
    to see the thrones of the eternal triumph
    or ever yet the warfare be abandoned

with light that through the whole of heaven is spread
    kindled are we and hence if thou desirest
    to know of us at thine own pleasure sate thee

thus by some one among those holy spirits
    was spoken and by beatrice speak speak
    securely and believe them even as gods

well i perceive how thou dost nest thyself
    in thine own light and drawest it from thine eyes
    because they coruscate when thou dost smile

but know not who thou art nor why thou hast
    spirit august thy station in the sphere
    that veils itself to men in alien rays

this said i in direction of the light
    which first had spoken to me whence it became
    by far more lucent than it was before

even as the sun that doth conceal himself
    by too much light when heat has worn away
    the tempering influence of the vapours dense

by greater rapture thus concealed itself
    in its own radiance the figure saintly
    and thus close close enfolded answered me

in fashion as the following canto sings






after that constantine the eagle turned
    against the course of heaven which it had followed
    behind the ancient who lavinia took

two hundred years and more the bird of god
    in the extreme of europe held itself
    near to the mountains whence it issued first

and under shadow of the sacred plumes
    it governed there the world from hand to hand
    and changing thus upon mine own alighted

caesar i was and am justinian
    who by the will of primal love i feel
    took from the laws the useless and redundant

and ere unto the work i was attent
    one nature to exist in christ not more
    believed and with such faith was i contented

but blessed agapetus he who was
    the supreme pastor to the faith sincere
    pointed me out the way by words of his

him i believed and what was his assertion
    i now see clearly even as thou seest
    each contradiction to be false and true

as soon as with the church i moved my feet
    god in his grace it pleased with this high task
    to inspire me and i gave me wholly to it

and to my belisarius i commended
    the arms to which was heavens right hand so joined
    it was a signal that i should repose

now here to the first question terminates
    my answer but the character thereof
    constrains me to continue with a sequel

in order that thou see with how great reason
    men move against the standard sacrosanct
    both who appropriate and who oppose it

behold how great a power has made it worthy
    of reverence beginning from the hour
    when pallas died to give it sovereignty

thou knowest it made in alba its abode
    three hundred years and upward till at last
    the three to three fought for it yet again

thou knowest what it achieved from sabine wrong
    down to lucretias sorrow in seven kings
    oercoming round about the neighboring nations

thou knowest what it achieved borne by the romans
    illustrious against brennus against pyrrhus
    against the other princes and confederates

torquatus thence and quinctius who from locks
    unkempt was named decii and fabii
    received the fame i willingly embalm

it struck to earth the pride of the arabians
    who following hannibal had passed across
    the alpine ridges po from which thou glidest

beneath it triumphed while they yet were young
    pompey and scipio and to the hill
    beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed

then near unto the time when heaven had willed
    to bring the whole world to its mood serene
    did caesar by the will of rome assume it

what it achieved from var unto the rhine
    isere beheld and saone beheld the seine
    and every valley whence the rhone is filled

what it achieved when it had left ravenna
    and leaped the rubicon was such a flight
    that neither tongue nor pen could follow it

round towards spain it wheeled its legions then
    towards durazzo and pharsalia smote
    that to the calid nile was felt the pain

antandros and the simois whence it started
    it saw again and there where hector lies
    and ill for ptolemy then roused itself

from thence it came like lightning upon juba
    then wheeled itself again into your west
    where the pompeian clarion it heard

from what it wrought with the next standardbearer
    brutus and cassius howl in hell together
    and modena and perugia dolent were

still doth the mournful cleopatra weep
    because thereof who fleeing from before it
    took from the adder sudden and black death

with him it ran even to the red sea shore
    with him it placed the world in so great peace
    that unto janus was his temple closed

but what the standard that has made me speak
    achieved before and after should achieve
    throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it

becometh in appearance mean and dim
    if in the hand of the third caesar seen
    with eye unclouded and affection pure

because the living justice that inspires me
    granted it in the hand of him i speak of
    the glory of doing vengeance for its wrath

now here attend to what i answer thee
    later it ran with titus to do vengeance
    upon the vengeance of the ancient sin

and when the tooth of lombardy had bitten
    the holy church then underneath its wings
    did charlemagne victorious succor her

now hast thou power to judge of such as those
    whom i accused above and of their crimes
    which are the cause of all your miseries

to the public standard one the yellow lilies
    opposes the other claims it for a party
    so that tis hard to see which sins the most

let let the ghibellines ply their handicraft
    beneath some other standard for this ever
    ill follows he who it and justice parts

and let not this new charles eer strike it down
    he and his guelfs but let him fear the talons
    that from a nobler lion stripped the fell

already oftentimes the sons have wept
    the fathers crime and let him not believe
    that god will change his scutcheon for the lilies

this little planet doth adorn itself
    with the good spirits that have active been
    that fame and honour might come after them

and whensoever the desires mount thither
    thus deviating must perforce the rays
    of the true love less vividly mount upward

but in commensuration of our wages
    with our desert is portion of our joy
    because we see them neither less nor greater

herein doth living justice sweeten so
    affection in us that for evermore
    it cannot warp to any iniquity

voices diverse make up sweet melodies
    so in this life of ours the seats diverse
    render sweet harmony among these spheres

and in the compass of this present pearl
    shineth the sheen of romeo of whom
    the grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded

but the provencals who against him wrought
    they have not laughed and therefore ill goes he
    who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others

four daughters and each one of them a queen
    had raymond berenger and this for him
    did romeo a poor man and a pilgrim

and then malicious words incited him
    to summon to a reckoning this just man
    who rendered to him seven and five for ten

then he departed poor and stricken in years
    and if the world could know the heart he had
    in begging bit by bit his livelihood

though much it laud him it would laud him more







osanna sanctus deus sabaoth
    superillustrans claritate tua
    felices ignes horum malahoth

in this wise to his melody returning
    this substance upon which a double light
    doubles itself was seen by me to sing

and to their dance this and the others moved
    and in the manner of swifthurrying sparks
    veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance

doubting was i and saying tell her tell her
    within me tell her saying tell my lady
    who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences

and yet that reverence which doth lord it over
    the whole of me only by b and ice
    bowed me again like unto one who drowses

short while did beatrice endure me thus
    and she began lighting me with a smile
    such as would make one happy in the fire

according to infallible advisement
    after what manner a just vengeance justly
    could be avenged has put thee upon thinking

but i will speedily thy mind unloose
    and do thou listen for these words of mine
    of a great doctrine will a present make thee

by not enduring on the power that wills
    curb for his good that man who neer was born
    damning himself damned all his progeny

whereby the human species down below
    lay sick for many centuries in great error
    till to descend it pleased the word of god

to where the nature which from its own maker
    estranged itself he joined to him in person
    by the sole act of his eternal love

now unto what is said direct thy sight
    this nature when united to its maker
    such as created was sincere and good

but by itself alone was banished forth
    from paradise because it turned aside
    out of the way of truth and of its life

therefore the penalty the cross held out
    if measured by the nature thus assumed
    none ever yet with so great justice stung

and none was ever of so great injustice
    considering who the person was that suffered
    within whom such a nature was contracted

from one act therefore issued things diverse
    to god and to the jews one death was pleasing
    earth trembled at it and the heaven was opened

it should no longer now seem difficult
    to thee when it is said that a just vengeance
    by a just court was afterward avenged

but now do i behold thy mind entangled
    from thought to thought within a knot from which
    with great desire it waits to free itself

thou sayest well discern i what i hear
    but it is hidden from me why god willed
    for our redemption only this one mode

buried remaineth brother this decree
    unto the eyes of every one whose nature
    is in the flame of love not yet adult

verily inasmuch as at this mark
    one gazes long and little is discerned
    wherefore this mode was worthiest will i say

goodness divine which from itself doth spurn
    all envy burning in itself so sparkles
    that the eternal beauties it unfolds

whateer from this immediately distils
    has afterwards no end for neer removed
    is its impression when it sets its seal

whateer from this immediately rains down
    is wholly free because it is not subject
    unto the influences of novel things

the more conformed thereto the more it pleases
    for the blest ardour that irradiates all things
    in that most like itself is most vivacious

with all of these things has advantaged been
    the human creature and if one be wanting
    from his nobility he needs must fall

tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him
    and render him unlike the good supreme
    so that he little with its light is blanched

and to his dignity no more returns
    unless he fill up where transgression empties
    with righteous pains for criminal delights

your nature when it sinned so utterly
    in its own seed out of these dignities
    even as out of paradise was driven

nor could itself recover if thou notest
    with nicest subtilty by any way
    except by passing one of these two fords

either that god through clemency alone
    had pardon granted or that man himself
    had satisfaction for his folly made

fix now thine eye deep into the abyss
    of the eternal counsel to my speech
    as far as may be fastened steadfastly

man in his limitations had not power
    to satisfy not having power to sink
    in his humility obeying then

far as he disobeying thought to rise
    and for this reason man has been from power
    of satisfying by himself excluded

therefore it god behoved in his own ways
    man to restore unto his perfect life
    i say in one or else in both of them

but since the action of the doer is
    so much more grateful as it more presents
    the goodness of the heart from which it issues

goodness divine that doth imprint the world
    has been contented to proceed by each
    and all its ways to lift you up again

nor twixt the first day and the final night
    such high and such magnificent proceeding
    by one or by the other was or shall be

for god more bounteous was himself to give
    to make man able to uplift himself
    than if he only of himself had pardoned

and all the other modes were insufficient
    for justice were it not the son of god
    himself had humbled to become incarnate

now to fill fully each desire of thine
    return i to elucidate one place
    in order that thou there mayst see as i do

thou sayst i see the air i see the fire
    the water and the earth and all their mixtures
    come to corruption and short while endure

and these things notwithstanding were created
    therefore if that which i have said were true
    they should have been secure against corruption

the angels brother and the land sincere
    in which thou art created may be called
    just as they are in their entire existence

but all the elements which thou hast named
    and all those things which out of them are made
    by a created virtue are informed

created was the matter which they have
    created was the informing influence
    within these stars that round about them go

the soul of every brute and of the plants
    by its potential temperament attracts
    the ray and motion of the holy lights

but your own life immediately inspires
    supreme beneficence and enamours it
    so with herself it evermore desires her

and thou from this mayst argue furthermore
    your resurrection if thou think again
    how human flesh was fashioned at that time

when the first parents both of them were made







the world used in its peril to believe
    that the fair cypria delirious love
    rayed out in the third epicycle turning

wherefore not only unto her paid honour
    of sacrifices and of votive cry
    the ancient nations in the ancient error

but both dione honoured they and cupid
    that as her mother this one as her son
    and said that he had sat in didos lap

and they from her whence i beginning take
    took the denomination of the star
    that woos the sun now following now in front

i was not ware of our ascending to it
    but of our being in it gave full faith
    my lady whom i saw more beauteous grow

and as within a flame a spark is seen
    and as within a voice a voice discerned
    when one is steadfast and one comes and goes

within that light beheld i other lamps
    move in a circle speeding more and less
    methinks in measure of their inward vision

from a cold cloud descended never winds
    or visible or not so rapidly
    they would not laggard and impeded seem

to any one who had those lights divine
    seen come towards us leaving the gyration
    begun at first in the high seraphim

and behind those that most in front appeared
    sounded osanna so that never since
    to hear again was i without desire

then unto us more nearly one approached
    and it alone began we all are ready
    unto thy pleasure that thou joy in us

we turn around with the celestial princes
    one gyre and one gyration and one thirst
    to whom thou in the world of old didst say

ye who intelligent the third heaven are moving
    and are so full of love to pleasure thee
    a little quiet will not be less sweet

after these eyes of mine themselves had offered
    unto my lady reverently and she
    content and certain of herself had made them

back to the light they turned which so great promise
    made of itself and say who art thou was
    my voice imprinted with a great affection

o how and how much i beheld it grow
    with the new joy that superadded was
    unto its joys as soon as i had spoken

thus changed it said to me the world possessed me
    short time below and if it had been more
    much evil will be which would not have been

my gladness keepeth me concealed from thee
    which rayeth round about me and doth hide me
    like as a creature swathed in its own silk

much didst thou love me and thou hadst good reason
    for had i been below i should have shown thee
    somewhat beyond the foliage of my love

that lefthand margin which doth bathe itself
    in rhone when it is mingled with the sorgue
    me for its lord awaited in due time

and that horn of ausonia which is towned
    with bari with gaeta and catona
    whence tronto and verde in the sea disgorge

already flashed upon my brow the crown
    of that dominion which the danube waters
    after the german borders it abandons

and beautiful trinacria that is murky
    twixt pachino and peloro 

not through typhoeus but through nascent sulphur
    would have awaited her own monarchs still
    through me from charles descended and from rudolph

if evil lordship that exasperates ever
    the subject populations had not moved
    palermo to the outcry of death death

and if my brother could but this foresee
    the greedy poverty of catalonia
    straight would he flee that it might not molest him

for verily tis needful to provide
    through him or other so that on his bark
    already freighted no more freight be placed

his nature which from liberal covetous
    descended such a soldiery would need
    as should not care for hoarding in a chest

because i do believe the lofty joy
    thy speech infuses into me my lord
    where every good thing doth begin and end

thou seest as i see it the more grateful
    is it to me and this too hold i dear
    that gazing upon god thou dost discern it

glad hast thou made me so make clear to me
    since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt
    how from sweet seed can bitter issue forth

this i to him and he to me if i
    can show to thee a truth to what thou askest
    thy face thoult hold as thou dost hold thy back

the good which all the realm thou art ascending
    turns and contents maketh its providence
    to be a power within these bodies vast

and not alone the natures are foreseen
    within the mind that in itself is perfect
    but they together with their preservation

for whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth
    falls foreordained unto an end foreseen
    even as a shaft directed to its mark

if that were not the heaven which thou dost walk
    would in such manner its effects produce
    that they no longer would be arts but ruins

this cannot be if the intelligences
    that keep these stars in motion are not maimed
    and maimed the first that has not made them perfect

wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee
    and i not so for tis impossible
    that nature tire i see in what is needful

whence he again now say would it be worse
    for men on earth were they not citizens
    yes i replied and here i ask no reason

and can they be so if below they live not
    diversely unto offices diverse
    no if your master writeth well for you

so came he with deductions to this point
    then he concluded therefore it behoves
    the roots of your effects to be diverse

hence one is solon born another xerxes
    another melchisedec and another he
    who flying through the air his son did lose

revolving nature which a signet is
    to mortal wax doth practise well her art
    but not one inn distinguish from another

thence happens it that esau differeth
    in seed from jacob and quirinus comes
    from sire so vile that he is given to mars

a generated nature its own way
    would always make like its progenitors
    if providence divine were not triumphant

now that which was behind thee is before thee
    but that thou know that i with thee am pleased
    with a corollary will i mantle thee

evermore nature if it fortune find
    discordant to it like each other seed
    out of its region maketh evil thrift

and if the world below would fix its mind
    on the foundation which is laid by nature
    pursuing that twould have the people good

but you unto religion wrench aside
    him who was born to gird him with the sword
    and make a king of him who is for sermons

therefore your footsteps wander from the road






beautiful clemence after that thy charles
    had me enlightened he narrated to me
    the treacheries his seed should undergo

but said be still and let the years roll round
    so i can only say that lamentation
    legitimate shall follow on your wrongs

and of that holy light the life already
    had to the sun which fills it turned again
    as to that good which for each thing sufficeth

ah souls deceived and creatures impious
    who from such good do turn away your hearts
    directing upon vanity your foreheads

and now behold another of those splendours
    approached me and its will to pleasure me
    it signified by brightening outwardly

the eyes of beatrice that fastened were
    upon me as before of dear assent
    to my desire assurance gave to me

ah bring swift compensation to my wish
    thou blessed spirit i said and give me proof
    that what i think in thee i can reflect

whereat the light that still was new to me
    out of its depths whence it before was singing
    as one delighted to do good continued

within that region of the land depraved
    of italy that lies between rialto
    and fountainheads of brenta and of piava

rises a hill and mounts not very high
    wherefrom descended formerly a torch
    that made upon that region great assault

out of one root were born both i and it
    cunizza was i called and here i shine
    because the splendour of this star oercame me

but gladly to myself the cause i pardon
    of my allotment and it does not grieve me
    which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar

of this so luculent and precious jewel
    which of our heaven is nearest unto me
    great fame remained and ere it die away

this hundredth year shall yet quintupled be
    see if man ought to make him excellent
    so that another life the first may leave

and thus thinks not the present multitude
    shut in by adige and tagliamento
    nor yet for being scourged is penitent

but soon twill be that padua in the marsh
    will change the water that vicenza bathes
    because the folk are stubborn against duty

and where the sile and cagnano join
    one lordeth it and goes with lofty head
    for catching whom een now the net is making

feltro moreover of her impious pastor
    shall weep the crime which shall so monstrous be
    that for the like none ever entered malta

ample exceedingly would be the vat
    that of the ferrarese could hold the blood
    and weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce

of which this courteous priest shall make a gift
    to show himself a partisan and such gifts
    will to the living of the land conform

above us there are mirrors thrones you call them
    from which shines out on us god judicant
    so that this utterance seems good to us

here it was silent and it had the semblance
    of being turned elsewhither by the wheel
    on which it entered as it was before

the other joy already known to me
    became a thing transplendent in my sight
    as a fine ruby smitten by the sun

through joy effulgence is acquired above
    as here a smile but down below the shade
    outwardly darkens as the mind is sad

god seeth all things and in him blest spirit
    thy sight is said i so that never will
    of his can possibly from thee be hidden

thy voice then that for ever makes the heavens
    glad with the singing of those holy fires
    which of their six wings make themselves a cowl

wherefore does it not satisfy my longings
    indeed i would not wait thy questioning
    if i in thee were as thou art in me

the greatest of the valleys where the water
    expands itself forthwith its words began
    that sea excepted which the earth engarlands

between discordant shores against the sun
    extends so far that it meridian makes
    where it was wont before to make the horizon

i was a dweller on that valleys shore
    twixt ebro and magra that with journey short
    doth from the tuscan part the genoese

with the same sunset and same sunrise nearly
    sit buggia and the city whence i was
    that with its blood once made the harbour hot

folco that people called me unto whom
    my name was known and now with me this heaven
    imprints itself as i did once with it

for more the daughter of belus never burned
    offending both sichaeus and creusa
    than i so long as it became my locks

nor yet that rodophean who deluded
    was by demophoon nor yet alcides
    when iole he in his heart had locked

yet here is no repenting but we smile
    not at the fault which comes not back to mind
    but at the power which ordered and foresaw

here we behold the art that doth adorn
    with such affection and the good discover
    whereby the world above turns that below

but that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear
    thy wishes hence which in this sphere are born
    still farther to proceed behoveth me

thou fain wouldst know who is within this light
    that here beside me thus is scintillating
    even as a sunbeam in the limpid water

then know thou that within there is at rest
    rahab and being to our order joined
    with her in its supremest grade tis sealed

into this heaven where ends the shadowy cone
    cast by your world before all other souls
    first of christs triumph was she taken up

full meet it was to leave her in some heaven
    even as a palm of the high victory
    which he acquired with one palm and the other

because she favoured the first glorious deed
    of joshua upon the holy land
    that little stirs the memory of the pope

thy city which an offshoot is of him
    who first upon his maker turned his back
    and whose ambition is so sorely wept

brings forth and scatters the accursed flower
    which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray
    since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf

for this the evangel and the mighty doctors
    are derelict and only the decretals
    so studied that it shows upon their margins

on this are pope and cardinals intent
    their meditations reach not nazareth
    there where his pinions gabriel unfolded

but vatican and the other parts elect
    of rome which have a cemetery been
    unto the soldiery that followed peter

shall soon be free from this adultery







looking into his son with all the love
    which each of them eternally breathes forth
    the primal and unutterable power

whateer before the mind or eye revolves
    with so much order made there can be none
    who this beholds without enjoying him

lift up then reader to the lofty wheels
    with me thy vision straight unto that part
    where the one motion on the other strikes

and there begin to contemplate with joy
    that masters art who in himself so loves it
    that never doth his eye depart therefrom

behold how from that point goes branching off
    the oblique circle which conveys the planets
    to satisfy the world that calls upon them

and if their pathway were not thus inflected
    much virtue in the heavens would be in vain
    and almost every power below here dead

if from the straight line distant more or less
    were the departure much would wanting be
    above and underneath of mundane order

remain now reader still upon thy bench
    in thought pursuing that which is foretasted
    if thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary

ive set before thee henceforth feed thyself
    for to itself diverteth all my care
    that theme whereof i have been made the scribe

the greatest of the ministers of nature
    who with the power of heaven the world imprints
    and measures with his light the time for us

with that part which above is called to mind
    conjoined along the spirals was revolving
    where each time earlier he presents himself

and i was with him but of the ascending
    i was not conscious saving as a man
    of a first thought is conscious ere it come

and beatrice she who is seen to pass
    from good to better and so suddenly
    that not by time her action is expressed

how lucent in herself must she have been
    and what was in the sun wherein i entered
    apparent not by colour but by light

i though i call on genius art and practice
    cannot so tell that it could be imagined
    believe one can and let him long to see it

and if our fantasies too lowly are
    for altitude so great it is no marvel
    since oer the sun was never eye could go

such in this place was the fourth family
    of the high father who forever sates it
    showing how he breathes forth and how begets

and beatrice began give thanks give thanks
    unto the sun of angels who to this
    sensible one has raised thee by his grace

never was heart of mortal so disposed
    to worship nor to give itself to god
    with all its gratitude was it so ready

as at those words did i myself become
    and all my love was so absorbed in him
    that in oblivion beatrice was eclipsed

nor this displeased her but she smiled at it
    so that the splendour of her laughing eyes
    my single mind on many things divided

lights many saw i vivid and triumphant
    make us a centre and themselves a circle
    more sweet in voice than luminous in aspect

thus girt about the daughter of latona
    we sometimes see when pregnant is the air
    so that it holds the thread which makes her zone

within the court of heaven whence i return
    are many jewels found so fair and precious
    they cannot be transported from the realm

and of them was the singing of those lights
    who takes not wings that he may fly up thither
    the tidings thence may from the dumb await

as soon as singing thus those burning suns
    had round about us whirled themselves three times
    like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles

ladies they seemed not from the dance released
    but who stop short in silence listening
    till they have gathered the new melody

and within one i heard beginning when
    the radiance of grace by which is kindled
    true love and which thereafter grows by loving

within thee multiplied is so resplendent
    that it conducts thee upward by that stair
    where without reascending none descends

who should deny the wine out of his vial
    unto thy thirst in liberty were not
    except as water which descends not seaward

fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered
    this garland that encircles with delight
    the lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven

of the lambs was i of the holy flock
    which dominic conducteth by a road
    where well one fattens if he strayeth not

he who is nearest to me on the right
    my brother and master was and he albertus
    is of cologne i thomas of aquinum

if thou of all the others wouldst be certain
    follow behind my speaking with thy sight
    upward along the blessed garland turning

that next effulgence issues from the smile
    of gratian who assisted both the courts
    in such wise that it pleased in paradise

the other which near by adorns our choir
    that peter was who een as the poor widow
    offered his treasure unto holy church

the fifth light that among us is the fairest
    breathes forth from such a love that all the world
    below is greedy to learn tidings of it

within it is the lofty mind where knowledge
    so deep was put that if the true be true
    to see so much there never rose a second

thou seest next the lustre of that taper
    which in the flesh below looked most within
    the angelic nature and its ministry

within that other little light is smiling
    the advocate of the christian centuries
    out of whose rhetoric augustine was furnished

now if thou trainest thy minds eye along
    from light to light pursuant of my praise
    with thirst already of the eighth thou waitest

by seeing every good therein exults
    the sainted soul which the fallacious world
    makes manifest to him who listeneth well

the body whence twas hunted forth is lying
    down in cieldauro and from martyrdom
    and banishment it came unto this peace

see farther onward flame the burning breath
    of isidore of beda and of richard
    who was in contemplation more than man

this whence to me returneth thy regard
    the light is of a spirit unto whom
    in his grave meditations death seemed slow

it is the light eternal of sigier
    who reading lectures in the street of straw
    did syllogize invidious verities

then as a horologe that calleth us
    what time the bride of god is rising up
    with matins to her spouse that he may love her

wherein one part the other draws and urges
    ting ting resounding with so sweet a note
    that swells with love the spirit well disposed

thus i beheld the glorious wheel move round
    and render voice to voice in modulation
    and sweetness that can not be comprehended

excepting there where joy is made eternal







o thou insensate care of mortal men
    how inconclusive are the syllogisms
    that make thee beat thy wings in downward flight

one after laws and one to aphorisms
    was going and one following the priesthood
    and one to reign by force or sophistry

and one in theft and one in state affairs
    one in the pleasures of the flesh involved
    wearied himself one gave himself to ease

when i from all these things emancipate
    with beatrice above there in the heavens
    with such exceeding glory was received

when each one had returned unto that point
    within the circle where it was before
    it stood as in a candlestick a candle

and from within the effulgence which at first
    had spoken unto me i heard begin
    smiling while it more luminous became

even as i am kindled in its ray
    so looking into the eternal light
    the occasion of thy thoughts i apprehend

thou doubtest and wouldst have me to resift
    in language so extended and so open
    my speech that to thy sense it may be plain

where just before i said where well one fattens
    and where i said there never rose a second
    and here tis needful we distinguish well

the providence which governeth the world
    with counsel wherein all created vision
    is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom


    two princes did ordain in her behoof
    which on this side and that might be her guide

the one was all seraphical in ardour
    the other by his wisdom upon earth
    a splendour was of light cherubical

one will i speak of for of both is spoken
    in praising one whichever may be taken
    because unto one end their labours were

between tupino and the stream that falls
    down from the hill elect of blessed ubald
    a fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs

from which perugia feels the cold and heat
    through porta sole and behind it weep
    gualdo and nocera their grievous yoke

from out that slope there where it breaketh most
    its steepness rose upon the world a sun
    as this one does sometimes from out the ganges

therefore let him who speaketh of that place
    say not ascesi for he would say little
    but orient if he properly would speak

he was not yet far distant from his rising
    before he had begun to make the earth
    some comfort from his mighty virtue feel

for he in youth his fathers wrath incurred
    for certain dame to whom as unto death
    the gate of pleasure no one doth unlock

and was before his spiritual court
    et coram patre unto her united
    then day by day more fervently he loved her

she reft of her first husband scorned obscure
    one thousand and one hundred years and more
    waited without a suitor till he came

naught it availed to hear that with amyclas
    found her unmoved at sounding of his voice
    he who struck terror into all the world

naught it availed being constant and undaunted
    so that when mary still remained below
    she mounted up with christ upon the cross

but that too darkly i may not proceed
    francis and poverty for these two lovers
    take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse

their concord and their joyous semblances
    the love the wonder and the sweet regard
    they made to be the cause of holy thoughts

so much so that the venerable bernard
    first bared his feet and after so great peace
    ran and in running thought himself too slow

o wealth unknown o veritable good
    giles bares his feet and bares his feet sylvester
    behind the bridegroom so doth please the bride

then goes his way that father and that master
    he and his lady and that family
    which now was girding on the humble cord

nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow
    at being son of peter bernardone
    nor for appearing marvellously scorned

but regally his hard determination
    to innocent he opened and from him
    received the primal seal upon his order

after the people mendicant increased
    behind this man whose admirable life
    better in glory of the heavens were sung

incoronated with a second crown
    was through honorius by the eternal spirit
    the holy purpose of this archimandrite

and when he had through thirst of martyrdom
    in the proud presence of the sultan preached
    christ and the others who came after him

and finding for conversion too unripe
    the folk and not to tarry there in vain
    returned to fruit of the italic grass

on the rude rock twixt tiber and the arno
    from christ did he receive the final seal
    which during two whole years his members bore

when he who chose him unto so much good
    was pleased to draw him up to the reward
    that he had merited by being lowly

unto his friars as to the rightful heirs
    his most dear lady did he recommend
    and bade that they should love her faithfully

and from her bosom the illustrious soul
    wished to depart returning to its realm
    and for its body wished no other bier

think now what man was he who was a fit
    companion over the high seas to keep
    the bark of peter to its proper bearings

and this man was our patriarch hence whoever
    doth follow him as he commands can see
    that he is laden with good merchandise

but for new pasturage his flock has grown
    so greedy that it is impossible
    they be not scattered over fields diverse

and in proportion as his sheep remote
    and vagabond go farther off from him
    more void of milk return they to the fold

verily some there are that fear a hurt
    and keep close to the shepherd but so few
    that little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods

now if my utterance be not indistinct
    if thine own hearing hath attentive been
    if thou recall to mind what i have said

in part contented shall thy wishes be
    for thou shalt see the plant thats chipped away
    and the rebuke that lieth in the words

where well one fattens if he strayeth not







soon as the blessed flame had taken up
    the final word to give it utterance
    began the holy millstone to revolve

and in its gyre had not turned wholly round
    before another in a ring enclosed it
    and motion joined to motion song to song

song that as greatly doth transcend our muses
    our sirens in those dulcet clarions
    as primal splendour that which is reflected

and as are spanned athwart a tender cloud
    two rainbows parallel and like in colour
    when juno to her handmaid gives command



and make the people here through covenant
    god set with noah presageful of the world
    that shall no more be covered with a flood

in such wise of those sempiternal roses
    the garlands twain encompassed us about
    and thus the outer to the inner answered

after the dance and other grand rejoicings
    both of the singing and the flaming forth
    effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender

together at once with one accord had stopped
    

out of the heart of one of the new lights
    there came a voice that needle to the star
    made me appear in turning thitherward

and it began the love that makes me fair
    draws me to speak about the other leader
    by whom so well is spoken here of mine

tis right where one is to bring in the other
    that as they were united in their warfare
    together likewise may their glory shine

the soldiery of christ which it had cost
    so dear to arm again behind the standard
    moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few

when the emperor who reigneth evermore
    provided for the host that was in peril
    through grace alone and not that it was worthy

and as was said he to his bride brought succour
    with champions twain at whose deed at whose word
    the straggling people were together drawn

within that region where the sweet west wind
    rises to open the new leaves wherewith
    europe is seen to clothe herself afresh

not far off from the beating of the waves
    behind which in his long career the sun
    sometimes conceals himself from every man

is situate the fortunate calahorra
    under protection of the mighty shield
    in which the lion subject is and sovereign

therein was born the amorous paramour
    of christian faith the athlete consecrate
    kind to his own and cruel to his foes

and when it was created was his mind
    replete with such a living energy
    that in his mother her it made prophetic

as soon as the espousals were complete
    between him and the faith at holy font
    where they with mutual safety dowered each other

the woman who for him had given assent
    saw in a dream the admirable fruit
    that issue would from him and from his heirs

and that he might be construed as he was
    a spirit from this place went forth to name him
    with his possessive whose he wholly was

dominic was he called and him i speak of
    even as of the husbandman whom christ
    elected to his garden to assist him

envoy and servant sooth he seemed of christ
    for the first love made manifest in him
    was the first counsel that was given by christ

silent and wakeful many a time was he
    discovered by his nurse upon the ground
    as if he would have said for this i came

o thou his father felix verily
    o thou his mother verily joanna
    if this interpreted means as is said

not for the world which people toil for now
    in following ostiense and taddeo
    but through his longing after the true manna

he in short time became so great a teacher
    that he began to go about the vineyard
    which fadeth soon if faithless be the dresser

and of the see 

not to dispense or two or three for six
    not any fortune of first vacancy
    non decimas quae sunt pauperum dei

he asked for but against the errant world
    permission to do battle for the seed
    of which these four and twenty plants surround thee

then with the doctrine and the will together
    with office apostolical he moved
    like torrent which some lofty vein outpresses

and in among the shoots heretical
    his impetus with greater fury smote
    wherever the resistance was the greatest

of him were made thereafter divers runnels
    whereby the garden catholic is watered
    so that more living its plantations stand

if such the one wheel of the biga was
    in which the holy church itself defended
    and in the field its civic battle won

truly full manifest should be to thee
    the excellence of the other unto whom
    thomas so courteous was before my coming

but still the orbit which the highest part
    of its circumference made is derelict
    so that the mould is where was once the crust

his family that had straight forward moved
    with feet upon his footprints are turned round
    so that they set the point upon the heel

and soon aware they will be of the harvest
    of this bad husbandry when shall the tares
    complain the granary is taken from them

yet say i he who searcheth leaf by leaf
    our volume through would still some page discover
    where he could read i am as i am wont

twill not be from casal nor acquasparta
    from whence come such unto the written word
    that one avoids it and the other narrows

bonaventura of bagnoregios life
    am i who always in great offices
    postponed considerations sinister

here are illuminato and agostino
    who of the first barefooted beggars were
    that with the cord the friends of god became

hugh of saint victor is among them here
    and peter mangiador and peter of spain
    who down below in volumes twelve is shining

nathan the seer and metropolitan
    chrysostom and anselmus and donatus
    who deigned to lay his hand to the first art

here is rabanus and beside me here
    shines the calabrian abbot joachim
    he with the spirit of prophecy endowed

to celebrate so great a paladin
    have moved me the impassioned courtesy
    and the discreet discourses of friar thomas

and with me they have moved this company







let him imagine who would well conceive
    what now i saw and let him while i speak
    retain the image as a steadfast rock

the fifteen stars that in their divers regions
    the sky enliven with a light so great
    that it transcends all clusters of the air

let him the wain imagine unto which
    our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day
    so that in turning of its pole it fails not

let him the mouth imagine of the horn
    that in the point beginneth of the axis
    round about which the primal wheel revolves

to have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven
    like unto that which minos daughter made
    the moment when she felt the frost of death

and one to have its rays within the other
    and both to whirl themselves in such a manner
    that one should forward go the other backward

and he will have some shadowing forth of that
    true constellation and the double dance
    that circled round the point at which i was

because it is as much beyond our wont
    as swifter than the motion of the chiana
    moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds

there sang they neither bacchus nor apollo
    but in the divine nature persons three
    and in one person the divine and human

the singing and the dance fulfilled their measure
    and unto us those holy lights gave need
    growing in happiness from care to care

then broke the silence of those saints concordant
    the light in which the admirable life
    of gods own mendicant was told to me

and said now that one straw is trodden out
    now that its seed is garnered up already
    sweet love invites me to thresh out the other

into that bosom thou believest whence
    was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek
    whose taste to all the world is costing dear

and into that which by the lance transfixed
    before and since such satisfaction made
    that it weighs down the balance of all sin

whateer of light it has to human nature
    been lawful to possess was all infused
    by the same power that both of them created

and hence at what i said above dost wonder
    when i narrated that no second had
    the good which in the fifth light is enclosed

now ope thine eyes to what i answer thee
    and thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse
    fit in the truth as centre in a circle

that which can die and that which dieth not
    are nothing but the splendour of the idea
    which by his love our lord brings into being

because that living light which from its fount
    effulgent flows so that it disunites not
    from him nor from the love in them intrined

through its own goodness reunites its rays
    in nine subsistences as in a mirror
    itself eternally remaining one

thence it descends to the last potencies
    downward from act to act becoming such
    that only brief contingencies it makes

and these contingencies i hold to be
    things generated which the heaven produces
    by its own motion with seed and without

neither their wax nor that which tempers it
    remains immutable and hence beneath
    the ideal signet more and less shines through

therefore it happens that the selfsame tree
    after its kind bears worse and better fruit
    and ye are born with characters diverse

if in perfection tempered were the wax
    and were the heaven in its supremest virtue
    the brilliance of the seal would all appear

but nature gives it evermore deficient
    in the like manner working as the artist
    who has the skill of art and hand that trembles

if then the fervent love the vision clear
    of primal virtue do dispose and seal
    perfection absolute is there acquired

thus was of old the earth created worthy
    of all and every animal perfection
    and thus the virgin was impregnate made

so that thine own opinion i commend
    that human nature never yet has been
    nor will be what it was in those two persons

now if no farther forth i should proceed
    then in what way was he without a peer
    would be the first beginning of thy words

but that may well appear what now appears not
    think who he was and what occasion moved him
    to make request when it was told him ask

ive not so spoken that thou canst not see
    clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom
    that he might be sufficiently a king

twas not to know the number in which are
    the motors here above or if necesse
    with a contingent eer necesse make

non si est dare primum motum esse
    or if in semicircle can be made
    triangle so that it have no right angle

whence if thou notest this and what i said
    a regal prudence is that peerless seeing
    in which the shaft of my intention strikes

and if on rose thou turnest thy clear eyes
    thoult see that it has reference alone
    to kings whore many and the good are rare

with this distinction take thou what i said
    and thus it can consist with thy belief
    of the first father and of our delight

and lead shall this be always to thy feet
    to make thee like a weary man move slowly
    both to the yes and no thou seest not

for very low among the fools is he
    who affirms without distinction or denies
    as well in one as in the other case

because it happens that full often bends
    current opinion in the false direction
    and then the feelings bind the intellect

far more than uselessly he leaves the shore
    
    who fishes for the truth and has no skill

and in the world proofs manifest thereof
    parmenides melissus brissus are
    and many who went on and knew not whither

thus did sabellius arius and those fools
    who have been even as swords unto the scriptures
    in rendering distorted their straight faces

nor yet shall people be too confident
    in judging even as he is who doth count
    the corn in field or ever it be ripe

for i have seen all winter long the thorn
    first show itself intractable and fierce
    and after bear the rose upon its top

and i have seen a ship direct and swift
    run oer the sea throughout its course entire
    to perish at the harbours mouth at last

let not dame bertha nor ser martin think
    seeing one steal another offering make
    to see them in the arbitrament divine

for one may rise and fall the other may







from centre unto rim from rim to centre
    in a round vase the water moves itself
    as from without tis struck or from within

into my mind upon a sudden dropped
    what i am saying at the moment when
    silent became the glorious life of thomas

because of the resemblance that was born
    of his discourse and that of beatrice
    whom after him it pleased thus to begin

this man has need 
    of going to the root of one truth more

declare unto him if the light wherewith
    blossoms your substance shall remain with you
    eternally the same that it is now

and if it do remain say in what manner
    after ye are again made visible
    it can be that it injure not your sight

as by a greater gladness urged and drawn
    they who are dancing in a ring sometimes
    uplift their voices and their motions quicken

so at that orison devout and prompt
    the holy circles a new joy displayed
    in their revolving and their wondrous song

whoso lamenteth him that here we die
    that we may live above has never there
    seen the refreshment of the eternal rain

the one and two and three who ever liveth
    and reigneth ever in three and two and one
    not circumscribed and all things circumscribing

three several times was chanted by each one
    among those spirits with such melody
    that for all merit it were just reward

and in the lustre most divine of all
    the lesser ring i heard a modest voice
    such as perhaps the angels was to mary

answer as long as the festivity
    of paradise shall be so long our love
    shall radiate round about us such a vesture

its brightness is proportioned to the ardour
    the ardour to the vision and the vision
    equals what grace it has above its worth

when glorious and sanctified our flesh
    is reassumed then shall our persons be
    more pleasing by their being all complete

for will increase whateer bestows on us
    of light gratuitous the good supreme
    light which enables us to look on him

therefore the vision must perforce increase
    increase the ardour which from that is kindled
    increase the radiance which from this proceeds

but even as a coal that sends forth flame
    and by its vivid whiteness overpowers it
    so that its own appearance it maintains

thus the effulgence that surrounds us now
    shall be oerpowered in aspect by the flesh
    which still today the earth doth cover up

nor can so great a splendour weary us
    for strong will be the organs of the body
    to everything which hath the power to please us

so sudden and alert appeared to me
    both one and the other choir to say amen
    that well they showed desire for their dead bodies

nor sole for them perhaps but for the mothers
    the fathers and the rest who had been dear
    or ever they became eternal flames

and lo all round about of equal brightness
    arose a lustre over what was there
    like an horizon that is clearing up

and as at rise of early eve begin
    along the welkin new appearances
    so that the sight seems real and unreal

it seemed to me that new subsistences
    began there to be seen and make a circle
    outside the other two circumferences

o very sparkling of the holy spirit
    how sudden and incandescent it became
    unto mine eyes that vanquished bore it not

but beatrice so beautiful and smiling
    appeared to me that with the other sights
    that followed not my memory i must leave her

then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed
    the power and i beheld myself translated
    to higher salvation with my lady only

well was i ware that i was more uplifted
    by the enkindled smiling of the star
    that seemed to me more ruddy than its wont

with all my heart and in that dialect
    which is the same in all such holocaust
    to god i made as the new grace beseemed

and not yet from my bosom was exhausted
    the ardour of sacrifice before i knew
    this offering was accepted and auspicious

for with so great a lustre and so red
    splendours appeared to me in twofold rays
    i said o helios who dost so adorn them

even as distinct with less and greater lights
    glimmers between the two poles of the world
    the galaxy that maketh wise men doubt

thus constellated in the depths of mars
    those rays described the venerable sign
    that quadrants joining in a circle make

here doth my memory overcome my genius
    for on that cross as levin gleamed forth christ
    so that i cannot find ensample worthy

but he who takes his cross and follows christ
    again will pardon me what i omit
    seeing in that aurora lighten christ

from horn to horn and twixt the top and base
    lights were in motion brightly scintillating
    as they together met and passed each other

thus level and aslant and swift and slow
    we here behold renewing still the sight
    the particles of bodies long and short

across the sunbeam move wherewith is listed
    sometimes the shade which for their own defence
    people with cunning and with art contrive

and as a lute and harp accordant strung
    with many strings a dulcet tinkling make
    to him by whom the notes are not distinguished

so from the lights that there to me appeared
    upgathered through the cross a melody
    which rapt me not distinguishing the hymn

well was i ware it was of lofty laud
    because there came to me arise and conquer
    as unto him who hears and comprehends not

so much enamoured i became therewith
    that until then there was not anything
    that eer had fettered me with such sweet bonds

perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold
    postponing the delight of those fair eyes
    into which gazing my desire has rest

but who bethinks him that the living seals
    of every beauty grow in power ascending
    and that i there had not turned round to those

can me excuse if i myself accuse
    to excuse myself and see that i speak truly
    for here the holy joy is not disclosed

because ascending it becomes more pure







a will benign in which reveals itself
    ever the love that righteously inspires
    as in the iniquitous cupidity

silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre
    and quieted the consecrated chords
    that heavens right hand doth tighten and relax

how unto just entreaties shall be deaf
    those substances which to give me desire
    of praying them with one accord grew silent

tis well that without end he should lament
    who for the love of thing that doth not last
    eternally despoils him of that love

as through the pure and tranquil evening air
    there shoots from time to time a sudden fire
    moving the eyes that steadfast were before

and seems to be a star that changeth place
    except that in the part where it is kindled
    nothing is missed and this endureth little

so from the horn that to the right extends
    unto that crosss foot there ran a star
    out of the constellation shining there

nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon
    but down the radiant fillet ran along
    so that fire seemed it behind alabaster

thus piteous did anchises shade reach forward
    if any faith our greatest muse deserve
    when in elysium he his son perceived

o sanguis meus o superinfusa
    gratia dei sicut tibi cui
    bis unquam coeli janua reclusa

thus that effulgence whence i gave it heed
    then round unto my lady turned my sight
    and on this side and that was stupefied

for in her eyes was burning such a smile
    that with mine own methought i touched the bottom
    both of my grace and of my paradise

then pleasant to the hearing and the sight
    the spirit joined to its beginning things
    i understood not so profound it spake

nor did it hide itself from me by choice
    but by necessity for its conception
    above the mark of mortals set itself

and when the bow of burning sympathy
    was so far slackened that its speech descended
    towards the mark of our intelligence

the first thing that was understood by me
    was benedight be thou o trine and one
    who hast unto my seed so courteous been

and it continued hunger long and grateful
    drawn from the reading of the mighty volume
    wherein is never changed the white nor dark

thou hast appeased my son within this light
    in which i speak to thee by grace of her
    who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee

thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass
    from him who is the first as from the unit
    if that be known ray out the five and six

and therefore who i am thou askest not
    and why i seem more joyous unto thee
    than any other of this gladsome crowd

thou thinkst the truth because the small and great
    of this existence look into the mirror
    wherein before thou thinkst thy thought thou showest

but that the sacred love in which i watch
    with sight perpetual and which makes me thirst
    with sweet desire may better be fulfilled

now let thy voice secure and frank and glad
    proclaim the wishes the desire proclaim
    to which my answer is decreed already

to beatrice i turned me and she heard
    before i spake and smiled to me a sign
    that made the wings of my desire increase

then in this wise began i love and knowledge
    when on you dawned the first equality
    of the same weight for each of you became

for in the sun which lighted you and burned
    with heat and radiance they so equal are
    that all similitudes are insufficient

but among mortals will and argument
    for reason that to you is manifest
    diversely feathered in their pinions are

whence i who mortal am feel in myself
    this inequality so give not thanks
    save in my heart for this paternal welcome

truly do i entreat thee living topaz
    set in this precious jewel as a gem
    that thou wilt satisfy me with thy name

o leaf of mine in whom i pleasure took
    een while awaiting i was thine own root
    such a beginning he in answer made me

then said to me that one from whom is named
    thy race and who a hundred years and more
    has circled round the mount on the first cornice

a son of mine and thy greatgrandsire was
    well it behoves thee that the long fatigue
    thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works

florence within the ancient boundary
    from which she taketh still her tierce and nones
    abode in quiet temperate and chaste

no golden chain she had nor coronal
    nor ladies shod with sandal shoon nor girdle
    that caught the eye more than the person did

not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear
    into the father for the time and dower
    did not oerrun this side or that the measure

no houses had she void of families
    not yet had thither come sardanapalus
    to show what in a chamber can be done

not yet surpassed had montemalo been
    by your uccellatojo which surpassed
    shall in its downfall be as in its rise

bellincion berti saw i go begirt
    with leather and with bone and from the mirror
    his dame depart without a painted face

and him of nerli saw and him of vecchio
    contented with their simple suits of buff
    and with the spindle and the flax their dames

o fortunate women and each one was certain
    of her own burialplace and none as yet
    for sake of france was in her bed deserted

one oer the cradle kept her studious watch
    and in her lullaby the language used
    that first delights the fathers and the mothers

another drawing tresses from her distaff
    told oer among her family the tales
    of trojans and of fesole and rome

as great a marvel then would have been held
    a lapo salterello a cianghella
    as cincinnatus or cornelia now

to such a quiet such a beautiful
    life of the citizen to such a safe
    community and to so sweet an inn

did mary give me with loud cries invoked
    and in your ancient baptistery at once
    christian and cacciaguida i became

moronto was my brother and eliseo
    from val di pado came to me my wife
    and from that place thy surname was derived

i followed afterward the emperor conrad
    and he begirt me of his chivalry
    so much i pleased him with my noble deeds

i followed in his train against that laws
    iniquity whose people doth usurp
    your just possession through your pastors fault

there by that execrable race was i
    released from bonds of the fallacious world
    the love of which defileth many souls

and came from martyrdom unto this peace







o thou our poor nobility of blood
    if thou dost make the people glory in thee
    down here where our affection languishes

a marvellous thing it neer will be to me
    for there where appetite is not perverted
    i say in heaven of thee i made a boast

truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens
    so that unless we piece thee day by day
    time goeth round about thee with his shears

with you which rome was first to tolerate
    
    yet once again my words beginning made

whence beatrice who stood somewhat apart
    smiling appeared like unto her who coughed
    at the first failing writ of guenever

and i began you are my ancestor
    you give to me all hardihood to speak
    you lift me so that i am more than i

so many rivulets with gladness fill
    my mind that of itself it makes a joy
    because it can endure this and not burst

then tell me my beloved root ancestral
    who were your ancestors and what the years
    that in your boyhood chronicled themselves

tell me about the sheepfold of saint john
    how large it was and who the people were
    within it worthy of the highest seats

as at the blowing of the winds a coal
    quickens to flame so i beheld that light
    become resplendent at my blandishments

and as unto mine eyes it grew more fair
    with voice more sweet and tender but not in
    this modern dialect it said to me

from uttering of the ave till the birth
    in which my mother who is now a saint
    of me was lightened who had been her burden

unto its lion had this fire returned
    five hundred fifty times and thirty more
    to reinflame itself beneath his paw

my ancestors and i our birthplace had
    where first is found the last ward of the city
    by him who runneth in your annual game

suffice it of my elders to hear this
    but who they were and whence they thither came
    silence is more considerate than speech

all those who at that time were there between
    mars and the baptist fit for bearing arms
    were a fifth part of those who now are living

but the community that now is mixed
    with campi and certaldo and figghine
    pure in the lowest artisan was seen

o how much better twere to have as neighbours
    the folk of whom i speak and at galluzzo
    and at trespiano have your boundary

than have them in the town and bear the stench
    of agugliones churl and him of signa
    who has sharp eyes for trickery already

had not the folk which most of all the world
    degenerates been a stepdame unto caesar
    but as a mother to her son benignant

some who turn florentines and trade and discount
    would have gone back again to simifonte
    there where their grandsires went about as beggars

at montemurlo still would be the counts
    the cerchi in the parish of acone
    perhaps in valdigrieve the buondelmonti

ever the intermingling of the people
    has been the source of malady in cities
    as in the body food it surfeits on

and a blind bull more headlong plunges down
    than a blind lamb and very often cuts
    better and more a single sword than five

if luni thou regard and urbisaglia
    how they have passed away and how are passing
    chiusi and sinigaglia after them

to hear how races waste themselves away
    will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard
    seeing that even cities have an end

all things of yours have their mortality
    even as yourselves but it is hidden in some
    that a long while endure and lives are short

and as the turning of the lunar heaven
    covers and bares the shores without a pause
    in the like manner fortune does with florence

therefore should not appear a marvellous thing
    what i shall say of the great florentines
    of whom the fame is hidden in the past

i saw the ughi saw the catellini
    filippi greci ormanni and alberichi
    even in their fall illustrious citizens

and saw as mighty as they ancient were
    with him of la sannella him of arca
    and soldanier ardinghi and bostichi

near to the gate that is at present laden
    with a new felony of so much weight
    that soon it shall be jetsam from the bark

the ravignani were from whom descended
    the county guido and whoeer the name
    of the great bellincione since hath taken

he of la pressa knew the art of ruling
    already and already galigajo
    had hilt and pommel gilded in his house

mighty already was the column vair
    sacchetti giuochi fifant and barucci
    and galli and they who for the bushel blush

the stock from which were the calfucci born
    was great already and already chosen
    to curule chairs the sizii and arrigucci

o how beheld i those who are undone
    by their own pride and how the balls of gold
    florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds

so likewise did the ancestors of those
    who evermore when vacant is your church
    fatten by staying in consistory

the insolent race that like a dragon follows
    whoever flees and unto him that shows
    his teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb

already rising was but from low people
    so that it pleased not ubertin donato
    that his wifes father should make him their kin

already had caponsacco to the market
    from fesole descended and already
    giuda and infangato were good burghers

ill tell a thing incredible but true
    one entered the small circuit by a gate
    which from the della pera took its name

each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon
    of the great baron whose renown and name
    the festival of thomas keepeth fresh

knighthood and privilege from him received
    though with the populace unites himself
    today the man who binds it with a border

already were gualterotti and importuni
    and still more quiet would the borgo be
    if with new neighbours it remained unfed

the house from which is born your lamentation
    through just disdain that death among you brought
    and put an end unto your joyous life

was honoured in itself and its companions
    o buondelmonte how in evil hour
    thou fledst the bridal at anothers promptings

many would be rejoicing who are sad
    if god had thee surrendered to the ema
    the first time that thou camest to the city

but it behoved the mutilated stone
    which guards the bridge that florence should provide
    a victim in her latest hour of peace

with all these families and others with them
    florence beheld i in so great repose
    that no occasion had she whence to weep

with all these families beheld so just
    and glorious her people that the lily
    never upon the spear was placed reversed

nor by division was vermilion made







as came to clymene to be made certain
    of that which he had heard against himself
    he who makes fathers chary still to children

even such was i and such was i perceived
    by beatrice and by the holy light
    that first on my account had changed its place

therefore my lady said to me send forth
    the flame of thy desire so that it issue
    imprinted well with the internal stamp

not that our knowledge may be greater made
    by speech of thine but to accustom thee
    to tell thy thirst that we may give thee drink

o my beloved tree 

while i was with virgilius conjoined
    upon the mountain that the souls doth heal
    and when descending into the dead world

were spoken to me of my future life
    some grievous words although i feel myself
    in sooth foursquare against the blows of chance

on this account my wish would be content
    to hear what fortune is approaching me
    because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly

thus did i say unto that selfsame light
    that unto me had spoken before and even
    as beatrice willed was my own will confessed

not in vague phrase in which the foolish folk
    ensnared themselves of old ere yet was slain
    the lamb of god who taketh sins away

but with clear words and unambiguous
    language responded that paternal love
    hid and revealed by its own proper smile

contingency that outside of the volume
    of your materiality extends not
    is all depicted in the eternal aspect

necessity however thence it takes not
    except as from the eye in which tis mirrored
    a ship that with the current down descends

from thence een as there cometh to the ear
    sweet harmony from an organ comes in sight
    to me the time that is preparing for thee

as forth from athens went hippolytus
    by reason of his stepdame false and cruel
    so thou from florence must perforce depart

already this is willed and this is sought for
    and soon it shall be done by him who thinks it
    where every day the christ is bought and sold

the blame shall follow the offended party
    in outcry as is usual but the vengeance
    shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it

thou shalt abandon everything beloved
    most tenderly and this the arrow is
    which first the bow of banishment shoots forth

thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt
    the bread of others and how hard a road
    the going down and up anothers stairs

and that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders
    will be the bad and foolish company
    with which into this valley thou shalt fall

for all ingrate all mad and impious
    will they become against thee but soon after
    they and not thou shall have the forehead scarlet

of their bestiality their own proceedings
    shall furnish proof so twill be well for thee
    a party to have made thee by thyself

thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn
    shall be the mighty lombards courtesy
    who on the ladder bears the holy bird

who such benign regard shall have for thee
    that twixt you twain in doing and in asking
    that shall be first which is with others last

with him shalt thou see one who at his birth
    has by this star of strength been so impressed
    that notable shall his achievements be

not yet the people are aware of him
    through his young age since only nine years yet
    around about him have these wheels revolved

but ere the gascon cheat the noble henry
    some sparkles of his virtue shall appear
    in caring not for silver nor for toil

so recognized shall his magnificence
    become hereafter that his enemies
    will not have power to keep mute tongues about it

on him rely and on his benefits
    by him shall many people be transformed
    changing condition rich and mendicant

and written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear
    of him but shalt not say itand things said he
    incredible to those who shall be present

then added son these are the commentaries
    on what was said to thee behold the snares
    that are concealed behind few revolutions

yet would i not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy
    because thy life into the future reaches
    beyond the punishment of their perfidies

when by its silence showed that sainted soul
    that it had finished putting in the woof
    into that web which i had given it warped

began i even as he who yearneth after
    being in doubt some counsel from a person
    who seeth and uprightly wills and loves

well see i father mine how spurreth on
    the time towards me such a blow to deal me
    as heaviest is to him who most gives way

therefore with foresight it is well i arm me
    that if the dearest place be taken from me
    i may not lose the others by my songs

down through the world of infinite bitterness
    and oer the mountain from whose beauteous summit
    the eyes of my own lady lifted me

and afterward through heaven from light to light
    i have learned that which if i tell again
    will be a savour of strong herbs to many

and if i am a timid friend to truth
    i fear lest i may lose my life with those
    who will hereafter call this time the olden

the light in which was smiling my own treasure
    which there i had discovered flashed at first
    as in the sunshine doth a golden mirror

then made reply a conscience overcast
    or with its own or with anothers shame
    will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word

but neertheless all falsehood laid aside
    make manifest thy vision utterly
    and let them scratch wherever is the itch

for if thine utterance shall offensive be
    at the first taste a vital nutriment
    twill leave thereafter when it is digested

this cry of thine shall do as doth the wind
    which smiteth most the most exalted summits
    and that is no slight argument of honour

therefore are shown to thee within these wheels
    upon the mount and in the dolorous valley
    only the souls that unto fame are known

because the spirit of the hearer rests not
    nor doth confirm its faith by an example
    which has the root of it unknown and hidden

or other reason that is not apparent







now was alone rejoicing in its word
    that soul beatified and i was tasting
    my own the bitter tempering with the sweet

and the lady who to god was leading me
    said change thy thought consider that i am
    near unto him who every wrong disburdens

unto the loving accents of my comfort
    i turned me round and then what love i saw
    within those holy eyes i here relinquish

not only that my language i distrust
    but that my mind cannot return so far
    above itself unless another guide it

thus much upon that point can i repeat
    that her again beholding my affection
    from every other longing was released

while the eternal pleasure which direct
    rayed upon beatrice from her fair face
    contented me with its reflected aspect

conquering me with the radiance of a smile
    she said to me turn thee about and listen
    not in mine eyes alone is paradise

even as sometimes here do we behold
    the affection in the look if it be such
    that all the soul is wrapt away by it

so by the flaming of the effulgence holy
    to which i turned i recognized therein
    the wish of speaking to me somewhat farther

and it began in this fifth restingplace
    upon the tree that liveth by its summit
    and aye bears fruit and never loses leaf

are blessed spirits that below ere yet
    they came to heaven were of such great renown
    that every muse therewith would affluent be

therefore look thou upon the crosss horns
    he whom i now shall name will there enact
    what doth within a cloud its own swift fire

i saw athwart the cross a splendour drawn
    by naming joshua 
    nor noted i the word before the deed

and at the name of the great maccabee
    i saw another move itself revolving
    and gladness was the whip unto that top

likewise for charlemagne and for orlando
    two of them my regard attentive followed
    as followeth the eye its falcon flying

william thereafterward and renouard
    and the duke godfrey did attract my sight
    along upon that cross and robert guiscard

then moved and mingled with the other lights
    the soul that had addressed me showed how great
    an artist twas among the heavenly singers

to my right side i turned myself around
    my duty to behold in beatrice
    either by words or gesture signified

and so translucent i beheld her eyes
    so full of pleasure that her countenance
    surpassed its other and its latest wont

and as by feeling greater delectation
    a man in doing good from day to day
    becomes aware his virtue is increasing

so i became aware that my gyration
    with heaven together had increased its arc
    that miracle beholding more adorned

and such as is the change in little lapse
    of time in a pale woman when her face
    is from the load of bashfulness unladen

such was it in mine eyes when i had turned
    caused by the whiteness of the temperate star
    the sixth which to itself had gathered me

within that jovial torch did i behold
    the sparkling of the love which was therein
    delineate our language to mine eyes

and even as birds uprisen from the shore
    as in congratulation oer their food
    make squadrons of themselves now round now long

so from within those lights the holy creatures
    sang flying to and fro and in their figures
    made of themselves now d now i now l

first singing they to their own music moved
    then one becoming of these characters
    a little while they rested and were silent

o divine pegasea thou who genius
    dost glorious make and render it longlived
    and this through thee the cities and the kingdoms

illume me with thyself that i may bring
    their figures out as i have them conceived
    apparent be thy power in these brief verses

themselves then they displayed in five times seven
    vowels and consonants and i observed
    the parts as they seemed spoken unto me

diligite justitiam these were
    first verb and noun of all that was depicted
    qui judicatis terram were the last

thereafter in the m of the fifth word
    remained they so arranged that jupiter
    seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid

and other lights i saw descend where was
    the summit of the m and pause there singing
    the good i think that draws them to itself

then as in striking upon burning logs
    upward there fly innumerable sparks
    whence fools are wont to look for auguries

more than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise
    and to ascend some more and others less
    even as the sun that lights them had allotted

and each one being quiet in its place
    the head and neck beheld i of an eagle
    delineated by that inlaid fire

he who there paints has none to be his guide
    but himself guides and is from him remembered
    that virtue which is form unto the nest

the other beatitude that contented seemed
    at first to bloom a lily on the m
    by a slight motion followed out the imprint

o gentle star what and how many gems
    did demonstrate to me that all our justice
    effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest

wherefore i pray the mind in which begin
    thy motion and thy virtue to regard
    whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays

so that a second time it now be wroth
    with buying and with selling in the temple
    whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms

o soldiery of heaven whom i contemplate
    implore for those who are upon the earth
    all gone astray after the bad example

once twas the custom to make war with swords
    but now tis made by taking here and there
    the bread the pitying father shuts from none

yet thou who writest but to cancel think
    that peter and that paul who for this vineyard
    which thou art spoiling died are still alive

well canst thou say so steadfast my desire
    is unto him who willed to live alone
    and for a dance was led to martyrdom

that i know not the fisherman nor paul







appeared before me with its wings outspread
    the beautiful image that in sweet fruition
    made jubilant the interwoven souls

appeared a little ruby each wherein
    ray of the sun was burning so enkindled
    that each into mine eyes refracted it

and what it now behoves me to retrace
    nor voice has eer reported nor ink written
    nor was by fantasy eer comprehended

for speak i saw and likewise heard the beak
    and utter with its voice both i and my
    when in conception it was we and our

and it began being just and merciful
    am i exalted here unto that glory
    which cannot be exceeded by desire

and upon earth i left my memory
    such that the evilminded people there
    commend it but continue not the story

so doth a single heat from many embers
    make itself felt even as from many loves
    issued a single sound from out that image

whence i thereafter o perpetual flowers
    of the eternal joy that only one
    make me perceive your odours manifold

exhaling break within me the great fast
    which a long season has in hunger held me
    not finding for it any food on earth

well do i know that if in heaven its mirror
    justice divine another realm doth make
    yours apprehends it not through any veil

you know how i attentively address me
    to listen and you know what is the doubt
    that is in me so very old a fast

even as a falcon issuing from his hood
    doth move his head and with his wings applaud him
    showing desire and making himself fine

saw i become that standard which of lauds
    was interwoven of the grace divine
    with such songs as he knows who there rejoices

then it began he who a compass turned
    on the worlds outer verge and who within it
    devised so much occult and manifest

could not the impress of his power so make
    on all the universe as that his word
    should not remain in infinite excess

and this makes certain that the first proud being
    who was the paragon of every creature
    by not awaiting light fell immature

and hence appears it that each minor nature
    is scant receptacle unto that good
    which has no end and by itself is measured

in consequence our vision which perforce
    must be some ray of that intelligence
    with which all things whatever are replete

cannot in its own nature be so potent
    that it shall not its origin discern
    far beyond that which is apparent to it

therefore into the justice sempiternal
    the power of vision that your world receives
    as eye into the ocean penetrates

which though it see the bottom near the shore
    upon the deep perceives it not and yet
    tis there but it is hidden by the depth

there is no light but comes from the serene
    that never is oercast nay it is darkness
    or shadow of the flesh or else its poison

amply to thee is opened now the cavern
    which has concealed from thee the living justice
    of which thou madst such frequent questioning

for saidst thou born a man is on the shore
    of indus and is none who there can speak
    of christ nor who can read nor who can write

and all his inclinations and his actions
    are good so far as human reason sees
    without a sin in life or in discourse

he dieth unbaptised and without faith
    where is this justice that condemneth him
    where is his fault if he do not believe

now who art thou that on the bench wouldst sit
    in judgment at a thousand miles away
    with the short vision of a single span

truly to him who with me subtilizes
    if so the scripture were not over you
    for doubting there were marvellous occasion

o animals terrene o stolid minds
    the primal will that in itself is good
    neer from itself the good supreme has moved

so much is just as is accordant with it
    no good created draws it to itself
    but it by raying forth occasions that

even as above her nest goes circling round
    the stork when she has fed her little ones
    and he who has been fed looks up at her

so lifted i my brows and even such
    became the blessed image which its wings
    was moving by so many counsels urged

circling around it sang and said as are
    my notes to thee who dost not comprehend them
    such is the eternal judgment to you mortals

those lucent splendours of the holy spirit
    grew quiet then but still within the standard
    that made the romans reverend to the world

it recommenced unto this kingdom never
    ascended one who had not faith in christ
    before or since he to the tree was nailed

but look thou many crying are christ christ
    who at the judgment shall be far less near
    to him than some shall be who knew not christ

such christians shall the ethiop condemn
    when the two companies shall be divided
    the one for ever rich the other poor

what to your kings may not the persians say
    when they that volume opened shall behold
    in which are written down all their dispraises

there shall be seen among the deeds of albert
    that which ere long shall set the pen in motion
    for which the realm of prague shall be deserted

there shall be seen the woe that on the seine
    he brings by falsifying of the coin
    who by the blow of a wild boar shall die

there shall be seen the pride that causes thirst
    which makes the scot and englishman so mad
    that they within their boundaries cannot rest

be seen the luxury and effeminate life
    of him of spain and the bohemian
    who valour never knew and never wished

be seen the cripple of jerusalem
    his goodness represented by an i
    while the reverse an m shall represent

be seen the avarice and poltroonery
    of him who guards the island of the fire
    wherein anchises finished his long life

and to declare how pitiful he is
    shall be his record in contracted letters
    which shall make note of much in little space

and shall appear to each one the foul deeds
    of uncle and of brother who a nation
    so famous have dishonoured and two crowns

and he of portugal and he of norway
    shall there be known and he of rascia too
    who saw in evil hour the coin of venice

o happy hungary if she let herself
    be wronged no farther and navarre the happy
    if with the hills that gird her she be armed

and each one may believe that now as hansel
    thereof do nicosia and famagosta
    lament and rage because of their own beast

who from the others flank departeth not







when he who all the world illuminates
    out of our hemisphere so far descends
    that on all sides the daylight is consumed

the heaven that erst by him alone was kindled
    doth suddenly reveal itself again
    by many lights wherein is one resplendent

and came into my mind this act of heaven
    when the ensign of the world and of its leaders
    had silent in the blessed beak become

because those living luminaries all
    by far more luminous did songs begin
    lapsing and falling from my memory

o gentle love that with a smile dost cloak thee
    how ardent in those sparks didst thou appear
    that had the breath alone of holy thoughts

after the precious and pellucid crystals
    with which begemmed the sixth light i beheld
    silence imposed on the angelic bells

i seemed to hear the murmuring of a river
    that clear descendeth down from rock to rock
    showing the affluence of its mountaintop

and as the sound upon the citherns neck
    taketh its form and as upon the vent
    of rustic pipe the wind that enters it

even thus relieved from the delay of waiting
    that murmuring of the eagle mounted up
    along its neck as if it had been hollow

there it became a voice and issued thence
    from out its beak in such a form of words
    as the heart waited for wherein i wrote them

the part in me which sees and bears the sun
    in mortal eagles it began to me
    now fixedly must needs be looked upon

for of the fires of which i make my figure
    those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head
    of all their orders the supremest are

he who is shining in the midst as pupil
    was once the singer of the holy spirit
    who bore the ark from city unto city

now knoweth he the merit of his song
    in so far as effect of his own counsel
    by the reward which is commensurate

of five that make a circle for my brow
    he that approacheth nearest to my beak
    did the poor widow for her son console

now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost
    not following christ by the experience
    of this sweet life and of its opposite

he who comes next in the circumference
    of which i speak upon its highest arc
    did death postpone by penitence sincere

now knoweth he that the eternal judgment
    suffers no change albeit worthy prayer
    maketh below tomorrow of today

the next who follows with the laws and me
    under the good intent that bore bad fruit
    became a greek by ceding to the pastor

now knoweth he how all the ill deduced
    from his good action is not harmful to him
    although the world thereby may be destroyed

and he whom in the downward arc thou seest
    guglielmo was whom the same land deplores
    that weepeth charles and frederick yet alive

now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is
    with a just king and in the outward show
    of his effulgence he reveals it still

who would believe down in the errant world
    that eer the trojan ripheus in this round
    could be the fifth one of the holy lights

now knoweth he enough of what the world
    has not the power to see of grace divine
    although his sight may not discern the bottom

like as a lark that in the air expatiates
    first singing and then silent with content
    of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her

such seemed to me the image of the imprint
    of the eternal pleasure by whose will
    doth everything become the thing it is

and notwithstanding to my doubt i was
    as glass is to the colour that invests it
    to wait the time in silence it endured not

but forth from out my mouth what things are these
    extorted with the force of its own weight
    whereat i saw great joy of coruscation

thereafterward with eye still more enkindled
    the blessed standard made to me reply
    to keep me not in wonderment suspended

i see that thou believest in these things
    because i say them but thou seest not how
    so that although believed in they are hidden

thou doest as he doth who a thing by name
    well apprehendeth but its quiddity
    cannot perceive unless another show it

regnum coelorum suffereth violence
    from fervent love and from that living hope
    that overcometh the divine volition

not in the guise that man oercometh man
    but conquers it because it will be conquered
    and conquered conquers by benignity

the first life of the eyebrow and the fifth
    cause thee astonishment because with them
    thou seest the region of the angels painted

they passed not from their bodies as thou thinkest
    gentiles but christians in the steadfast faith
    of feet that were to suffer and had suffered

for one from hell where no one eer turns back
    unto good will returned unto his bones
    and that of living hope was the reward

of living hope that placed its efficacy
    in prayers to god made to resuscitate him
    so that twere possible to move his will

the glorious soul concerning which i speak
    returning to the flesh where brief its stay
    believed in him who had the power to aid it

and in believing kindled to such fire
    of genuine love that at the second death
    worthy it was to come unto this joy

the other one through grace that from so deep
    a fountain wells that never hath the eye
    of any creature reached its primal wave

set all his love below on righteousness
    wherefore from grace to grace did god unclose
    his eye to our redemption yet to be

whence he believed therein and suffered not
    from that day forth the stench of paganism
    and he reproved therefor the folk perverse

those maidens three whom at the righthand wheel
    thou didst behold were unto him for baptism
    more than a thousand years before baptizing

o thou predestination how remote
    thy root is from the aspect of all those
    who the first cause do not behold entire

and you o mortals hold yourselves restrained
    in judging for ourselves who look on god
    we do not know as yet all the elect

and sweet to us is such a deprivation
    because our good in this good is made perfect
    that whatsoeer god wills we also will

after this manner by that shape divine
    to make clear in me my shortsightedness
    was given to me a pleasant medicine

and as good singer a good lutanist
    accompanies with vibrations of the chords
    whereby more pleasantness the song acquires

so while it spake do i remember me
    that i beheld both of those blessed lights
    even as the winking of the eyes concords

moving unto the words their little flames







already on my ladys face mine eyes
    again were fastened and with these my mind
    and from all other purpose was withdrawn

and she smiled not but if i were to smile
    she unto me began thou wouldst become
    like semele when she was turned to ashes

because my beauty that along the stairs
    of the eternal palace more enkindles
    as thou hast seen the farther we ascend

if it were tempered not is so resplendent
    that all thy mortal power in its effulgence
    would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes

we are uplifted to the seventh splendour
    that underneath the burning lions breast
    now radiates downward mingled with his power

fix in direction of thine eyes the mind
    and make of them a mirror for the figure
    that in this mirror shall appear to thee

he who could know what was the pasturage
    my sight had in that blessed countenance
    when i transferred me to another care

would recognize how grateful was to me
    obedience unto my celestial escort
    by counterpoising one side with the other

within the crystal which around the world
    revolving bears the name of its dear leader
    under whom every wickedness lay dead

coloured like gold on which the sunshine gleams
    a stairway i beheld to such a height
    uplifted that mine eye pursued it not

likewise beheld i down the steps descending
    so many splendours that i thought each light
    that in the heaven appears was there diffused

and as accordant with their natural custom
    the rooks together at the break of day
    bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold

then some of them fly off without return
    others come back to where they started from
    and others wheeling round still keep at home

such fashion it appeared to me was there
    within the sparkling that together came
    as soon as on a certain step it struck

and that which nearest unto us remained
    became so clear that in my thought i said
    well i perceive the love thou showest me

but she from whom i wait the how and when
    of speech and silence standeth still whence i
    against desire do well if i ask not

she thereupon who saw my silentness
    in the sight of him who seeth everything
    said unto me let loose thy warm desire

and i began no merit of my own
    renders me worthy of response from thee
    but for her sake who granteth me the asking

thou blessed life that dost remain concealed
    in thy beatitude make known to me
    the cause which draweth thee so near my side

and tell me why is silent in this wheel
    the dulcet symphony of paradise
    that through the rest below sounds so devoutly

thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight
    it answer made to me they sing not here
    for the same cause that beatrice has not smiled

thus far adown the holy stairways steps
    have i descended but to give thee welcome
    with words and with the light that mantles me

nor did more love cause me to be more ready
    for love as much and more up there is burning
    as doth the flaming manifest to thee

but the high charity that makes us servants
    prompt to the counsel which controls the world
    allotteth here even as thou dost observe

i see full well said i o sacred lamp
    how love unfettered in this court sufficeth
    to follow the eternal providence

but this is what seems hard for me to see
    wherefore predestinate wast thou alone
    unto this office from among thy consorts

no sooner had i come to the last word
    than of its middle made the light a centre
    whirling itself about like a swift millstone

when answer made the love that was therein
    on me directed is a light divine
    piercing through this in which i am embosomed

of which the virtue with my sight conjoined
    lifts me above myself so far i see
    the supreme essence from which this is drawn

hence comes the joyfulness with which i flame
    for to my sight as far as it is clear
    the clearness of the flame i equal make

but that soul in the heaven which is most pure
    that seraph which his eye on god most fixes
    could this demand of thine not satisfy

because so deeply sinks in the abyss
    of the eternal statute what thou askest
    from all created sight it is cut off

and to the mortal world when thou returnest
    this carry back that it may not presume
    longer towrd such a goal to move its feet

the mind that shineth here on earth doth smoke
    from this observe how can it do below
    that which it cannot though the heaven assume it

such limit did its words prescribe to me
    the question i relinquished and restricted
    myself to ask it humbly who it was

between two shores of italy rise cliffs
    and not far distant from thy native place
    so high the thunders far below them sound

and form a ridge that catria is called
    neath which is consecrate a hermitage
    wont to be dedicate to worship only

thus unto me the third speech recommenced
    and then continuing it said therein
    unto gods service i became so steadfast

that feeding only on the juice of olives
    lightly i passed away the heats and frosts
    contented in my thoughts contemplative

that cloister used to render to these heavens
    abundantly and now is empty grown
    so that perforce it soon must be revealed

i in that place was peter damiano
    and peter the sinner was i in the house
    of our lady on the adriatic shore

little of mortal life remained to me
    when i was called and dragged forth to the hat
    which shifteth evermore from bad to worse

came cephas and the mighty vessel came
    of the holy spirit meagre and barefooted
    taking the food of any hostelry

now some one to support them on each side
    the modern shepherds need and some to lead them
    so heavy are they and to hold their trains

they cover up their palfreys with their cloaks
    so that two beasts go underneath one skin
    o patience that dost tolerate so much

at this voice saw i many little flames
    from step to step descending and revolving
    and every revolution made them fairer

round about this one came they and stood still
    and a cry uttered of so loud a sound
    it here could find no parallel nor i

distinguished it the thunder so oercame me







oppressed with stupor i unto my guide
    turned like a little child who always runs
    for refuge there where he confideth most

and she even as a mother who straightway
    gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy
    with voice whose wont it is to reassure him

said to me knowest thou not thou art in heaven
    and knowest thou not that heaven is holy all
    and what is done here cometh from good zeal

after what wise the singing would have changed thee
    and i by smiling thou canst now imagine
    since that the cry has startled thee so much

in which if thou hadst understood its prayers
    already would be known to thee the vengeance
    which thou shalt look upon before thou diest

the sword above here smiteth not in haste
    nor tardily howeer it seem to him
    who fearing or desiring waits for it

but turn thee round towards the others now
    for very illustrious spirits shalt thou see
    if thou thy sight directest as i say

as it seemed good to her mine eyes i turned
    and saw a hundred spherules that together
    with mutual rays each other more embellished

i stood as one who in himself represses
    the point of his desire and ventures not
    to question he so feareth the too much

and now the largest and most luculent
    among those pearls came forward that it might
    make my desire concerning it content

within it then i heard if thou couldst see
    even as myself the charity that burns
    among us thy conceits would be expressed

but that by waiting thou mayst not come late
    to the high end i will make answer even
    unto the thought of which thou art so chary

that mountain on whose slope cassino stands
    was frequented of old upon its summit
    by a deluded folk and illdisposed

and i am he who first up thither bore
    the name of him who brought upon the earth
    the truth that so much sublimateth us

and such abundant grace upon me shone
    that all the neighbouring towns i drew away
    from the impious worship that seduced the world

these other fires each one of them were men
    contemplative enkindled by that heat
    which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up

here is macarius here is romualdus
    here are my brethren who within the cloisters
    their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart

and i to him the affection which thou showest
    speaking with me and the good countenance
    which i behold and note in all your ardours

in me have so my confidence dilated
    as the sun doth the rose when it becomes
    as far unfolded as it hath the power

therefore i pray and thou assure me father
    if i may so much grace receive that i
    may thee behold with countenance unveiled

he thereupon brother thy high desire
    in the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled
    where are fulfilled all others and my own

there perfect is and ripened and complete
    every desire within that one alone
    is every part where it has always been

for it is not in space nor turns on poles
    and unto it our stairway reaches up
    whence thus from out thy sight it steals away

up to that height the patriarch jacob saw it
    extending its supernal part what time
    so thronged with angels it appeared to him

but to ascend it now no one uplifts
    his feet from off the earth and now my rule
    below remaineth for mere waste of paper

the walls that used of old to be an abbey
    are changed to dens of robbers and the cowls
    are sacks filled full of miserable flour

but heavy usury is not taken up
    so much against gods pleasure as that fruit
    which maketh so insane the heart of monks

for whatsoever hath the church in keeping
    is for the folk that ask it in gods name
    not for ones kindred or for something worse

the flesh of mortals is so very soft
    that good beginnings down below suffice not
    from springing of the oak to bearing acorns

peter began with neither gold nor silver
    and i with orison and abstinence
    and francis with humility his convent

and if thou lookest at each ones beginning
    and then regardest whither he has run
    thou shalt behold the white changed into brown

in verity the jordan backward turned
    and the seas fleeing when god willed were more
    a wonder to behold than succour here

thus unto me he said and then withdrew
    to his own band and the band closed together
    then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt

the gentle lady urged me on behind them
    up oer that stairway by a single sign
    so did her virtue overcome my nature

nor here below where one goes up and down
    by natural law was motion eer so swift
    that it could be compared unto my wing

reader as i may unto that devout
    triumph return on whose account i often
    for my transgressions weep and beat my breast

thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire
    and drawn it out again before i saw
    the sign that follows taurus and was in it

o glorious stars o light impregnated
    with mighty virtue from which i acknowledge
    all of my genius whatsoeer it be

with you was born and hid himself with you
    he who is father of all mortal life
    when first i tasted of the tuscan air

and then when grace was freely given to me
    to enter the high wheel which turns you round
    your region was allotted unto me

to you devoutly at this hour my soul
    is sighing that it virtue may acquire
    for the stern pass that draws it to itself

thou art so near unto the last salvation
    thus beatrice began thou oughtest now
    to have thine eves unclouded and acute

and therefore ere thou enter farther in
    look down once more and see how vast a world
    thou hast already put beneath thy feet

so that thy heart as jocund as it may
    present itself to the triumphant throng
    that comes rejoicing through this rounded ether

i with my sight returned through one and all
    the sevenfold spheres and i beheld this globe
    such that i smiled at its ignoble semblance

and that opinion i approve as best
    which doth account it least and he who thinks
    of something else may truly be called just

i saw the daughter of latona shining
    without that shadow which to me was cause
    that once i had believed her rare and dense

the aspect of thy son hyperion
    here i sustained and saw how move themselves
    around and near him maia and dione

thence there appeared the temperateness of jove
    twixt son and father and to me was clear
    the change that of their whereabout they make

and all the seven made manifest to me
    how great they are and eke how swift they are
    and how they are in distant habitations

the threshingfloor that maketh us so proud
    to me revolving with the eternal twins
    was all apparent made from hill to harbour

then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes i turned







even as a bird mid the beloved leaves
    quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood
    throughout the night that hideth all things from us

who that she may behold their longedfor looks
    and find the food wherewith to nourish them
    in which to her grave labours grateful are

anticipates the time on open spray
    and with an ardent longing waits the sun
    gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn

even thus my lady standing was erect
    and vigilant turned round towards the zone
    underneath which the sun displays less haste

so that beholding her distraught and wistful
    such i became as he is who desiring
    for something yearns and hoping is appeased

but brief the space from one when to the other
    of my awaiting say i and the seeing
    the welkin grow resplendent more and more

and beatrice exclaimed behold the hosts
    of christs triumphal march and all the fruit
    harvested by the rolling of these spheres

it seemed to me her face was all aflame
    and eyes she had so full of ecstasy
    that i must needs pass on without describing

as when in nights serene of the full moon
    smiles trivia among the nymphs eternal
    who paint the firmament through all its gulfs

saw i above the myriads of lamps
    a sun that one and all of them enkindled
    een as our own doth the supernal sights

and through the living light transparent shone
    the lucent substance so intensely clear
    into my sight that i sustained it not

o beatrice thou gentle guide and dear
    to me she said what overmasters thee
    a virtue is from which naught shields itself

there are the wisdom and the omnipotence
    that oped the thoroughfares twixt heaven and earth
    for which there erst had been so long a yearning

as fire from out a cloud unlocks itself
    dilating so it finds not room therein
    and down against its nature falls to earth

so did my mind among those aliments
    becoming larger issue from itself
    and that which it became cannot remember

open thine eyes and look at what i am
    thou hast beheld such things that strong enough
    hast thou become to tolerate my smile

i was as one who still retains the feeling
    of a forgotten vision and endeavours
    in vain to bring it back into his mind

when i this invitation heard deserving
    of so much gratitude it never fades
    out of the book that chronicles the past

if at this moment sounded all the tongues
    that polyhymnia and her sisters made
    most lubrical with their delicious milk

to aid me to a thousandth of the truth
    it would not reach singing the holy smile
    and how the holy aspect it illumed

and therefore representing paradise
    the sacred poem must perforce leap over
    even as a man who finds his way cut off

but whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme
    and of the mortal shoulder laden with it
    should blame it not if under this it tremble

it is no passage for a little boat
    this which goes cleaving the audacious prow
    nor for a pilot who would spare himself

why doth my face so much enamour thee
    that to the garden fair thou turnest not
    which under the rays of christ is blossoming

there is the rose in which the word divine
    became incarnate there the lilies are
    by whose perfume the good way was discovered

thus beatrice and i who to her counsels
    was wholly ready once again betook me
    unto the battle of the feeble brows

as in the sunshine that unsullied streams
    through fractured cloud ere now a meadow of flowers
    mine eyes with shadow covered oer have seen

so troops of splendours manifold i saw
    illumined from above with burning rays
    beholding not the source of the effulgence

o power benignant that dost so imprint them
    thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope
    there to mine eyes that were not strong enough

the name of that fair flower i eer invoke
    morning and evening utterly enthralled
    my soul to gaze upon the greater fire

and when in both mine eyes depicted were
    the glory and greatness of the living star
    which there excelleth as it here excelled

athwart the heavens a little torch descended
    formed in a circle like a coronal
    and cinctured it and whirled itself about it

whatever melody most sweetly soundeth
    on earth and to itself most draws the soul
    would seem a cloud that rent asunder thunders

compared unto the sounding of that lyre
    wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful
    which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue

i am angelic love that circle round
    the joy sublime which breathes from out the womb
    that was the hostelry of our desire

and i shall circle lady of heaven while
    thou followest thy son and makst diviner
    the sphere supreme because thou enterest there

thus did the circulated melody
    seal itself up and all the other lights
    were making to resound the name of mary

the regal mantle of the volumes all
    of that world which most fervid is and living
    with breath of god and with his works and ways

extended over us its inner border
    so very distant that the semblance of it
    there where i was not yet appeared to me

therefore mine eyes did not possess the power
    of following the incoronated flame
    which mounted upward near to its own seed

and as a little child that towards its mother
    stretches its arms when it the milk has taken
    through impulse kindled into outward flame

each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached
    so with its summit that the deep affection
    they had for mary was revealed to me

thereafter they remained there in my sight
    regina coeli singing with such sweetness
    that neer from me has the delight departed

o what exuberance is garnered up
    within those richest coffers which had been
    good husbandmen for sowing here below

there they enjoy and live upon the treasure
    which was acquired while weeping in the exile
    of babylon wherein the gold was left

there triumpheth beneath the exalted son
    of god and mary in his victory
    both with the ancient council and the new

he who doth keep the keys of such a glory







o company elect to the great supper
    of the lamb benedight who feedeth you
    so that for ever full is your desire

if by the grace of god this man foretaste
    something of that which falleth from your table
    or ever death prescribe to him the time

direct your mind to his immense desire
    and him somewhat bedew ye drinking are
    for ever at the fount whence comes his thought

thus beatrice and those souls beatified
    transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles
    flaming intensely in the guise of comets

and as the wheels in works of horologes
    revolve so that the first to the beholder
    motionless seems and the last one to fly

so in like manner did those carols dancing
    in different measure of their affluence
    give me the gauge as they were swift or slow

from that one which i noted of most beauty
    beheld i issue forth a fire so happy
    that none it left there of a greater brightness

and around beatrice three several times
    it whirled itself with so divine a song
    my fantasy repeats it not to me

therefore the pen skips and i write it not
    since our imagination for such folds
    much more our speech is of a tint too glaring

o holy sister mine who us implorest
    with such devotion by thine ardent love
    thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere

thereafter having stopped the blessed fire
    unto my lady did direct its breath
    which spake in fashion as i here have said

and she o light eterne of the great man
    to whom our lord delivered up the keys
    he carried down of this miraculous joy

this one examine on points light and grave
    as good beseemeth thee about the faith
    by means of which thou on the sea didst walk

if he love well and hope well and believe
    from thee tis hid not for thou hast thy sight
    there where depicted everything is seen

but since this kingdom has made citizens
    by means of the true faith to glorify it
    tis well he have the chance to speak thereof

as baccalaureate arms himself and speaks not
    until the master doth propose the question
    to argue it and not to terminate it

so did i arm myself with every reason
    while she was speaking that i might be ready
    for such a questioner and such profession

say thou good christian manifest thyself
    what is the faith whereat i raised my brow
    unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth

then turned i round to beatrice and she
    prompt signals made to me that i should pour
    the water forth from my internal fountain

may grace that suffers me to make confession
    began i to the great centurion
    cause my conceptions all to be explicit

and i continued as the truthful pen
    father of thy dear brother wrote of it
    who put with thee rome into the good way

faith is the substance of the things we hope for
    and evidence of those that are not seen
    and this appears to me its quiddity

then heard i very rightly thou perceivest
    if well thou understandest why he placed it
    with substances and then with evidences

and i thereafterward the things profound
    that here vouchsafe to me their apparition
    unto all eyes below are so concealed

that they exist there only in belief
    upon the which is founded the high hope
    and hence it takes the nature of a substance

and it behoveth us from this belief
    to reason without having other sight
    and hence it has the nature of evidence

then heard i if whatever is acquired
    below by doctrine were thus understood
    no sophists subtlety would there find place

thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love
    then added very well has been gone over
    already of this coin the alloy and weight

but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse
    and i yes both so shining and so round
    that in its stamp there is no peradventure

thereafter issued from the light profound
    that there resplendent was this precious jewel
    upon the which is every virtue founded

whence hadst thou it and i the large outpouring
    of holy spirit which has been diffused
    upon the ancient parchments and the new

a syllogism is which proved it to me
    with such acuteness that compared therewith
    all demonstration seems to me obtuse

and then i heard the ancient and the new
    postulates that to thee are so conclusive
    why dost thou take them for the word divine

and i the proofs which show the truth to me
    are the works subsequent whereunto nature
    neer heated iron yet nor anvil beat

twas answered me say who assureth thee
    that those works ever were the thing itself
    that must be proved nought else to thee affirms it

were the world to christianity converted
    i said withouten miracles this one
    is such the rest are not its hundredth part

because that poor and fasting thou didst enter
    into the field to sow there the good plant
    which was a vine and has become a thorn

this being finished the high holy court
    resounded through the spheres one god we praise
    in melody that there above is chanted

and then that baron who from branch to branch
    examining had thus conducted me
    till the extremest leaves we were approaching

again began the grace that dallying
    plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened
    up to this point as it should opened be

so that i do approve what forth emerged
    but now thou must express what thou believest
    and whence to thy belief it was presented

o holy father spirit who beholdest
    what thou believedst so that thou oercamest
    towards the sepulchre more youthful feet

began i thou dost wish me in this place
    the form to manifest of my prompt belief
    and likewise thou the cause thereof demandest

and i respond in one god i believe
    sole and eterne who moveth all the heavens
    with love and with desire himself unmoved

and of such faith not only have i proofs
    physical and metaphysical but gives them
    likewise the truth that from this place rains down

through moses through the prophets and the psalms
    through the evangel and through you who wrote
    after the fiery spirit sanctified you

in persons three eterne believe and these
    one essence i believe so one and trine
    they bear conjunction both with sunt and est

with the profound condition and divine
    which now i touch upon doth stamp my mind
    ofttimes the doctrine evangelical

this the beginning is this is the spark
    which afterwards dilates to vivid flame
    and like a star in heaven is sparkling in me

even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him
    his servant straight embraces gratulating
    for the good news as soon as he is silent

so giving me its benediction singing
    three times encircled me when i was silent
    the apostolic light at whose command

i spoken had in speaking i so pleased him







if eer it happen that the poem sacred
    to which both heaven and earth have set their hand
    so that it many a year hath made me lean

oercome the cruelty that bars me out
    from the fair sheepfold where a lamb i slumbered
    an enemy to the wolves that war upon it

with other voice forthwith with other fleece
    poet will i return and at my font
    baptismal will i take the laurel crown

because into the faith that maketh known
    all souls to god there entered i and then
    peter for her sake thus my brow encircled

thereafterward towards us moved a light
    out of that band whence issued the firstfruits
    which of his vicars christ behind him left

and then my lady full of ecstasy
    said unto me look look behold the baron
    for whom below galicia is frequented

in the same way as when a dove alights
    near his companion both of them pour forth
    circling about and murmuring their affection

so one beheld i by the other grand
    prince glorified to be with welcome greeted
    lauding the food that there above is eaten

but when their gratulations were complete
    silently coram me each one stood still
    so incandescent it oercame my sight

smiling thereafterwards said beatrice
    illustrious life by whom the benefactions
    of our basilica have been described

make hope resound within this altitude
    thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it
    as jesus to the three gave greater clearness

lift up thy head and make thyself assured
    for what comes hither from the mortal world
    must needs be ripened in our radiance

this comfort came to me from the second fire
    wherefore mine eyes i lifted to the hills
    which bent them down before with too great weight

since through his grace our emperor wills that thou
    shouldst find thee face to face before thy death
    in the most secret chamber with his counts

so that the truth beholden of this court
    hope which below there rightfully enamours
    thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others

say what it is and how is flowering with it
    thy mind and say from whence it came to thee
    thus did the second light again continue

and the compassionate who piloted
    the plumage of my wings in such high flight
    did in reply anticipate me thus

no child whatever the church militant
    of greater hope possesses as is written
    in that sun which irradiates all our band

therefore it is conceded him from egypt
    to come into jerusalem to see
    or ever yet his warfare be completed

the two remaining points that not for knowledge
    have been demanded but that he report
    how much this virtue unto thee is pleasing

to him i leave for hard he will not find them
    nor of selfpraise and let him answer them
    and may the grace of god in this assist him

as a disciple who his teacher follows
    ready and willing where he is expert
    that his proficiency may be displayed

hope said i is the certain expectation
    of future glory which is the effect
    of grace divine and merit precedent

from many stars this light comes unto me
    but he instilled it first into my heart
    who was chief singer unto the chief captain

sperent in te in the high theody
    he sayeth those who know thy name and who
    knoweth it not if he my faith possess

thou didst instil me then with his instilling
    in the epistle so that i am full
    and upon others rain again your rain

while i was speaking in the living bosom
    of that combustion quivered an effulgence
    sudden and frequent in the guise of lightning

then breathed the love wherewith i am inflamed
    towards the virtue still which followed me
    unto the palm and issue of the field

wills that i breathe to thee that thou delight
    in her and grateful to me is thy telling
    whatever things hope promises to thee

and i the ancient scriptures and the new
    the mark establish and this shows it me
    of all the souls whom god hath made his friends

isaiah saith that each one garmented
    in his own land shall be with twofold garments
    and his own land is this delightful life

thy brother too far more explicitly
    there where he treateth of the robes of white
    this revelation manifests to us

and first and near the ending of these words
    sperent in te from over us was heard
    to which responsive answered all the carols

thereafterward a light among them brightened
    so that if cancer one such crystal had
    winter would have a month of one sole day

and as uprises goes and enters the dance
    a winsome maiden only to do honour
    to the new bride and not from any failing

even thus did i behold the brightened splendour
    approach the two who in a wheel revolved
    as was beseeming to their ardent love

into the song and music there it entered
    and fixed on them my lady kept her look
    even as a bride silent and motionless

this is the one who lay upon the breast
    of him our pelican and this is he
    to the great office from the cross elected

my lady thus but therefore none the more
    did move her sight from its attentive gaze
    before or afterward these words of hers

even as a man who gazes and endeavours
    to see the eclipsing of the sun a little
    and who by seeing sightless doth become

so i became before that latest fire
    while it was said why dost thou daze thyself
    to see a thing which here hath no existence

earth in the earth my body is and shall be
    with all the others there until our number
    with the eternal proposition tallies

with the two garments in the blessed cloister
    are the two lights alone that have ascended
    and this shalt thou take back into your world

and at this utterance the flaming circle
    grew quiet with the dulcet intermingling
    of sound that by the trinal breath was made

as to escape from danger or fatigue
    the oars that erst were in the water beaten
    are all suspended at a whistles sound

ah how much in my mind was i disturbed
    when i turned round to look on beatrice
    that her i could not see although i was

close at her side and in the happy world






while i was doubting for my vision quenched
    out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it
    issued a breathing that attentive made me

saying while thou recoverest the sense
    of seeing which in me thou hast consumed
    tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it

begin then and declare to what thy soul
    is aimed and count it for a certainty
    sight is in thee bewildered and not dead

because the lady who through this divine
    region conducteth thee has in her look
    the power the hand of ananias had

i said as pleaseth her or soon or late
    let the cure come to eyes that portals were
    when she with fire i ever burn with entered

the good that gives contentment to this court
    the alpha and omega is of all
    the writing that love reads me low or loud

the selfsame voice that taken had from me
    the terror of the sudden dazzlement
    to speak still farther put it in my thought

and said in verity with finer sieve
    behoveth thee to sift thee it behoveth
    to say who aimed thy bow at such a target

and i by philosophic arguments
    and by authority that hence descends
    such love must needs imprint itself in me

for good so far as good when comprehended
    doth straight enkindle love and so much greater
    as more of goodness in itself it holds

then to that essence 

more than elsewhither must the mind be moved
    of every one in loving who discerns
    the truth in which this evidence is founded

such truth he to my intellect reveals
    who demonstrates to me the primal love
    of all the sempiternal substances

the voice reveals it of the truthful author
    who says to moses speaking of himself
    i will make all my goodness pass before thee

thou too revealest it to me beginning
    the loud evangel that proclaims the secret
    of heaven to earth above all other edict

and i heard say by human intellect
    and by authority concordant with it
    of all thy loves reserve for god the highest

but say again if other cords thou feelest
    draw thee towards him that thou mayst proclaim
    with how many teeth this love is biting thee

the holy purpose of the eagle of christ
    not latent was nay rather i perceived
    whither he fain would my profession lead

therefore i recommenced all of those bites
    which have the power to turn the heart to god
    unto my charity have been concurrent

the being of the world and my own being
    the death which he endured that i may live
    and that which all the faithful hope as i do

with the forementioned vivid consciousness
    have drawn me from the sea of love perverse
    and of the right have placed me on the shore

the leaves wherewith embowered is all the garden
    of the eternal gardener do i love
    as much as he has granted them of good

as soon as i had ceased a song most sweet
    throughout the heaven resounded and my lady
    said with the others holy holy holy

and as at some keen light one wakes from sleep
    by reason of the visual spirit that runs
    unto the splendour passed from coat to coat

and he who wakes abhorreth what he sees
    so all unconscious is his sudden waking
    until the judgment cometh to his aid

so from before mine eyes did beatrice
    chase every mote with radiance of her own
    that cast its light a thousand miles and more

whence better after than before i saw
    and in a kind of wonderment i asked
    about a fourth light that i saw with us

and said my lady there within those rays
    gazes upon its maker the first soul
    that ever the first virtue did create

even as the bough that downward bends its top
    at transit of the wind and then is lifted
    by its own virtue which inclines it upward

likewise did i the while that she was speaking
    being amazed and then i was made bold
    by a desire to speak wherewith i burned

and i began o apple that mature
    alone hast been produced o ancient father
    to whom each wife is daughter and daughterinlaw

devoutly as i can i supplicate thee
    that thou wouldst speak to me thou seest my wish
    and i to hear thee quickly speak it not

sometimes an animal when covered struggles
    so that his impulse needs must be apparent
    by reason of the wrappage following it

and in like manner the primeval soul
    made clear to me athwart its covering
    how jubilant it was to give me pleasure

then breathed without thy uttering it to me
    thine inclination better i discern
    than thou whatever thing is surest to thee

for i behold it in the truthful mirror
    that of himself all things parhelion makes
    and none makes him parhelion of itself

thou fain wouldst hear how long ago god placed me
    within the lofty garden where this lady
    unto so long a stairway thee disposed

and how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure
    and of the great disdain the proper cause
    and the language that i used and that i made

now son of mine the tasting of the tree
    not in itself was cause of so great exile
    but solely the oerstepping of the bounds

there whence thy lady moved virgilius
    four thousand and three hundred and two circuits
    made by the sun this council i desired

and him i saw return to all the lights
    of his highway nine hundred times and thirty
    whilst i upon the earth was tarrying

the language that i spake was quite extinct
    before that in the work interminable
    the people under nimrod were employed

for nevermore result of reasoning
     was durable

a natural action is it that man speaks
    but whether thus or thus doth nature leave
    to your own art as seemeth best to you

ere i descended to the infernal anguish
    el was on earth the name of the chief good
    from whom comes all the joy that wraps me round

eli he then was called and that is proper
    because the use of men is like a leaf
    on bough which goeth and another cometh

upon the mount that highest oer the wave
    rises was i in life or pure or sinful
    from the first hour to that which is the second

as the sun changes quadrant to the sixth







glory be to the father to the son
    and holy ghost all paradise began
    so that the melody inebriate made me

what i beheld seemed unto me a smile
    of the universe for my inebriation
    found entrance through the hearing and the sight

o joy o gladness inexpressible
    o perfect life of love and peacefulness
    o riches without hankering secure

before mine eyes were standing the four torches
    enkindled and the one that first had come
    began to make itself more luminous

and even such in semblance it became
    as jupiter would become if he and mars
    were birds and they should interchange their feathers

that providence which here distributeth
    season and service in the blessed choir
    had silence upon every side imposed

when i heard say if i my colour change
    marvel not at it for while i am speaking
    thou shalt behold all these their colour change

he who usurps upon the earth my place
    my place my place which vacant has become
    before the presence of the son of god

has of my cemetery made a sewer
    of blood and stench whereby the perverse one
    who fell from here below there is appeased

with the same colour which through sun adverse
    painteth the clouds at evening or at morn
    beheld i then the whole of heaven suffused

and as a modest woman who abides
    sure of herself and at anothers failing
    from listening only timorous becomes

even thus did beatrice change countenance
    and i believe in heaven was such eclipse
    when suffered the supreme omnipotence

thereafterward proceeded forth his words
    with voice so much transmuted from itself
    the very countenance was not more changed

the spouse of christ has never nurtured been
    on blood of mine of linus and of cletus
    to be made use of in acquest of gold

but in acquest of this delightful life
    sixtus and pius urban and calixtus
    after much lamentation shed their blood

our purpose was not that on the right hand
    of our successors should in part be seated
    the christian folk in part upon the other

nor that the keys which were to me confided
    should eer become the escutcheon on a banner
    that should wage war on those who are baptized

nor i be made the figure of a seal
    to privileges venal and mendacious
    whereat i often redden and flash with fire

in garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves
    are seen from here above oer all the pastures
    o wrath of god why dost thou slumber still

to drink our blood the caorsines and gascons
    are making ready o thou good beginning
    unto how vile an end must thou needs fall

but the high providence that with scipio
    at rome the glory of the world defended
    will speedily bring aid as i conceive

and thou my son who by thy mortal weight
    shalt down return again open thy mouth
    what i conceal not do not thou conceal

as with its frozen vapours downward falls
    in flakes our atmosphere what time the horn
    of the celestial goat doth touch the sun

upward in such array saw i the ether
    become and flaked with the triumphant vapours
    which there together with us had remained

my sight was following up their semblances
    and followed till the medium by excess
    the passing farther onward took from it

whereat the lady who beheld me freed
    from gazing upward said to me cast down
    thy sight and see how far thou art turned round

since the first time that i had downward looked
    i saw that i had moved through the whole arc
    which the first climate makes from midst to end

so that i saw the mad track of ulysses
    past gades and this side well nigh the shore
    whereon became europa a sweet burden

and of this threshingfloor the site to me
    were more unveiled but the sun was proceeding
    under my feet a sign and more removed

my mind enamoured which is dallying
    at all times with my lady to bring back
    to her mine eyes was more than ever ardent

and if or art or nature has made bait
    to catch the eyes and so possess the mind
    in human flesh or in its portraiture

all joined together would appear as nought
    to the divine delight which shone upon me
    when to her smiling face i turned me round

the virtue that her look endowed me with
    from the fair nest of leda tore me forth
    and up into the swiftest heaven impelled me

its parts exceeding full of life and lofty
    are all so uniform i cannot say
    which beatrice selected for my place

but she who was aware of my desire
    began the while she smiled so joyously
    that god seemed in her countenance to rejoice

the nature of that motion which keeps quiet
    the centre and all the rest about it moves
    from hence begins as from its starting point

and in this heaven there is no other where
    than in the mind divine wherein is kindled
    the love that turns it and the power it rains

within a circle light and love embrace it
    even as this doth the others and that precinct
    he who encircles it alone controls

its motion is not by another meted
    but all the others measured are by this
    as ten is by the half and by the fifth

and in what manner time in such a pot
    may have its roots and in the rest its leaves
    now unto thee can manifest be made

o covetousness that mortals dost ingulf
    beneath thee so that no one hath the power
    of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves

full fairly blossoms in mankind the will
    but the uninterrupted rain converts
    into abortive wildings the true plums

fidelity and innocence are found
    only in children afterwards they both
    take flight or eer the cheeks with down are covered

one while he prattles still observes the fasts
    who when his tongue is loosed forthwith devours
    whatever food under whatever moon

another while he prattles loves and listens
    unto his mother who when speech is perfect
    forthwith desires to see her in her grave

even thus is swarthy made the skin so white
    in its first aspect of the daughter fair
    of him who brings the morn and leaves the night

thou that it may not be a marvel to thee
    think that on earth there is no one who governs
    whence goes astray the human family

ere january be unwintered wholly
    by the centesimal on earth neglected
    shall these supernal circles roar so loud

the tempest that has been so long awaited
    shall whirl the poops about where are the prows
    so that the fleet shall run its course direct

and the true fruit shall follow on the flower







after the truth against the present life
    of miserable mortals was unfolded
    by her who doth imparadise my mind

as in a lookingglass a tapers flame
    he sees who from behind is lighted by it
    before he has it in his sight or thought

and turns him round to see if so the glass
    tell him the truth and sees that it accords
    therewith as doth a music with its metre

in similar wise my memory recollecteth
    that i did looking into those fair eyes
    of which love made the springes to ensnare me

and as i turned me round and mine were touched
    by that which is apparent in that volume
    whenever on its gyre we gaze intent

a point beheld i that was raying out
    light so acute the sight which it enkindles
    must close perforce before such great acuteness

and whatsoever star seems smallest here
    would seem to be a moon if placed beside it
    as one star with another star is placed

perhaps at such a distance as appears
    a halo cincturing the light that paints it
    when densest is the vapour that sustains it

thus distant round the point a circle of fire
    so swiftly whirled that it would have surpassed
    whatever motion soonest girds the world

and this was by another circumcinct
    that by a third the third then by a fourth
    by a fifth the fourth and then by a sixth the fifth

the seventh followed thereupon in width
    so ample now that junos messenger
    entire would be too narrow to contain it

even so the eighth and ninth and every one
    more slowly moved according as it was
    in number distant farther from the first

and that one had its flame most crystalline
    from which less distant was the stainless spark
    i think because more with its truth imbued

my lady who in my anxiety
    beheld me much perplexed said from that point
    dependent is the heaven and nature all

behold that circle most conjoined to it
    and know thou that its motion is so swift
    through burning love whereby it is spurred on

and i to her if the world were arranged
    in the order which i see in yonder wheels
    whats set before me would have satisfied me

but in the world of sense we can perceive
    that evermore the circles are diviner
    as they are from the centre more remote

wherefore if my desire is to be ended
    in this miraculous and angelic temple
    that has for confines only love and light

to hear behoves me still how the example
    and the exemplar go not in one fashion
    since for myself in vain i contemplate it

if thine own fingers unto such a knot
    be insufficient it is no great wonder
    so hard hath it become for want of trying

my lady thus then said she do thou take
    what i shall tell thee if thou wouldst be sated
    and exercise on that thy subtlety

the circles corporal are wide and narrow
    according to the more or less of virtue
    which is distributed through all their parts

the greater goodness works the greater weal
    the greater weal the greater body holds
    if perfect equally are all its parts

therefore this one which sweeps along with it
    the universe sublime doth correspond
    unto the circle which most loves and knows

on which account if thou unto the virtue
    apply thy measure not to the appearance
    of substances that unto thee seem round

thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement
    of more to greater and of less to smaller
    in every heaven with its intelligence

even as remaineth splendid and serene
    the hemisphere of air when boreas
    is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest

because is purified and resolved the rack
    that erst disturbed it till the welkin laughs
    with all the beauties of its pageantry

thus did i likewise after that my lady
    had me provided with her clear response
    and like a star in heaven the truth was seen

and soon as to a stop her words had come
    not otherwise does iron scintillate
    when molten than those circles scintillated

their coruscation all the sparks repeated
    and they so many were their number makes
    more millions than the doubling of the chess

i heard them sing hosanna choir by choir
    to the fixed point which holds them at the ubi
    and ever will where they have ever been

and she who saw the dubious meditations
    within my mind the primal circles said
    have shown thee seraphim and cherubim

thus rapidly they follow their own bonds
    to be as like the point as most they can
    and can as far as they are high in vision

those other loves that round about them go
    thrones of the countenance divine are called
    because they terminate the primal triad

and thou shouldst know that they all have delight
    as much as their own vision penetrates
    the truth in which all intellect finds rest

from this it may be seen how blessedness
    is founded in the faculty which sees
    and not in that which loves and follows next

and of this seeing merit is the measure
    which is brought forth by grace and by good will
    thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed

the second triad which is germinating
    in such wise in this sempiternal spring
    that no nocturnal aries despoils

perpetually hosanna warbles forth
    with threefold melody that sounds in three
    orders of joy with which it is intrined

the three divine are in this hierarchy
    first the dominions and the virtues next
    and the third order is that of the powers

then in the dances twain penultimate
    the principalities and archangels wheel
    the last is wholly of angelic sports

these orders upward all of them are gazing
    and downward so prevail that unto god
    they all attracted are and all attract

and dionysius with so great desire
    to contemplate these orders set himself
    he named them and distinguished them as i do

but gregory afterwards dissented from him
    wherefore as soon as he unclosed his eyes
    within this heaven he at himself did smile

and if so much of secret truth a mortal
    proffered on earth i would not have thee marvel
    for he who saw it here revealed it to him

with much more of the truth about these circles







at what time both the children of latona
    surmounted by the ram and by the scales
    together make a zone of the horizon

as long as from the time the zenith holds them
    in equipoise till from that girdle both
    changing their hemisphere disturb the balance

so long her face depicted with a smile
    did beatrice keep silence while she gazed
    fixedly at the point which had oercome me

then she began i say and i ask not
    what thou dost wish to hear for i have seen it
    where centres every when and every ubi

not to acquire some good unto himself
    which is impossible but that his splendour
    in its resplendency may say subsisto

in his eternity outside of time
    outside all other limits as it pleased him
    into new loves the eternal love unfolded

nor as if torpid did he lie before
    for neither after nor before proceeded
    the going forth of god upon these waters

matter and form unmingled and conjoined
    came into being that had no defect
    een as three arrows from a threestringed bow

and as in glass in amber or in crystal
    a sunbeam flashes so that from its coming
    to its full being is no interval

so from its lord did the triform effect
    ray forth into its being all together
    without discrimination of beginning

order was concreated and constructed
    in substances and summit of the world
    were those wherein the pure act was produced

pure potentiality held the lowest part
    midway bound potentiality with act
    such bond that it shall never be unbound

jerome has written unto you of angels
    created a long lapse of centuries
    or ever yet the other world was made

but written is this truth in many places
    by writers of the holy ghost and thou
    shalt see it if thou lookest well thereat

and even reason seeth it somewhat
    for it would not concede that for so long
    could be the motors without their perfection

now dost thou know both where and when these loves
    created were and how so that extinct
    in thy desire already are three fires

nor could one reach in counting unto twenty
    so swiftly as a portion of these angels
    disturbed the subject of your elements

the rest remained and they began this art
    which thou discernest with so great delight
    that never from their circling do they cease

the occasion of the fall was the accursed
    presumption of that one whom thou hast seen
    by all the burden of the world constrained

those whom thou here beholdest modest were
    to recognise themselves as of that goodness
    which made them apt for so much understanding

on which account their vision was exalted
    by the enlightening grace and their own merit
    so that they have a full and steadfast will

i would not have thee doubt but certain be
    tis meritorious to receive this grace
    according as the affection opens to it

now round about in this consistory
    much mayst thou contemplate if these my words
    be gathered up without all further aid

but since upon the earth throughout your schools
    they teach that such is the angelic nature
    that it doth hear and recollect and will

more will i say that thou mayst see unmixed
    the truth that is confounded there below
    equivocating in such like prelections

these substances since in gods countenance
    they jocund were turned not away their sight
    from that wherefrom not anything is hidden

hence they have not their vision intercepted
    by object new and hence they do not need
    to recollect through interrupted thought

so that below not sleeping people dream
    believing they speak truth and not believing
    and in the last is greater sin and shame

below you do not journey by one path
    philosophising so transporteth you
    love of appearance and the thought thereof

and even this above here is endured
    with less disdain than when is set aside
    the holy writ or when it is distorted

they think not there how much of blood it costs
    to sow it in the world and how he pleases
    who in humility keeps close to it

each striveth for appearance and doth make
    his own inventions and these treated are
    by preachers and the evangel holds its peace

one sayeth that the moon did backward turn
    in the passion of christ and interpose herself
    so that the sunlight reached not down below

and lies for of its own accord the light
    hid itself whence to spaniards and to indians
    as to the jews did such eclipse respond

florence has not so many lapi and bindi
    as fables such as these that every year
    are shouted from the pulpit back and forth

in such wise that the lambs who do not know
    come back from pasture fed upon the wind
    and not to see the harm doth not excuse them

christ did not to his first disciples say
    go forth and to the world preach idle tales
    but unto them a true foundation gave

and this so loudly sounded from their lips
    that in the warfare to enkindle faith
    they made of the evangel shields and lances

now men go forth with jests and drolleries
    to preach and if but well the people laugh
    the hood puffs out and nothing more is asked

but in the cowl there nestles such a bird
    that if the common people were to see it
    they would perceive what pardons they confide in

for which so great on earth has grown the folly
    that without proof of any testimony
    to each indulgence they would flock together

by this saint anthony his pig doth fatten
    and many others who are worse than pigs
    paying in money without mark of coinage

but since we have digressed abundantly
    turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path
    so that the way be shortened with the time

this nature doth so multiply itself
    in numbers that there never yet was speech
    nor mortal fancy that can go so far

and if thou notest that which is revealed
    by daniel thou wilt see that in his thousands
    number determinate is kept concealed

the primal light that all irradiates it
    by modes as many is received therein
    as are the splendours wherewith it is mated

hence inasmuch as on the act conceptive
    the affection followeth of love the sweetness
    therein diversely fervid is or tepid

the height behold now and the amplitude
    of the eternal power since it hath made
    itself so many mirrors where tis broken

one in itself remaining as before







perchance six thousand miles remote from us
    is glowing the sixth hour and now this world
    inclines its shadow almost to a level

when the midheaven begins to make itself
    so deep to us that here and there a star
    ceases to shine so far down as this depth

and as advances bright exceedingly
    the handmaid of the sun the heaven is closed
    light after light to the most beautiful

not otherwise the triumph which for ever
    plays round about the point that vanquished me
    seeming enclosed by what itself encloses

little by little from my vision faded
    whereat to turn mine eyes on beatrice
    my seeing nothing and my love constrained me

if what has hitherto been said of her
    were all concluded in a single praise
    scant would it be to serve the present turn

not only does the beauty i beheld
    transcend ourselves but truly i believe
    its maker only may enjoy it all

vanquished do i confess me by this passage
    more than by problem of his theme was ever
    oercome the comic or the tragic poet

for as the sun the sight that trembles most
    even so the memory of that sweet smile
    my mind depriveth of its very self

from the first day that i beheld her face
    in this life to the moment of this look
    the sequence of my song has neer been severed

but now perforce this sequence must desist
    from following her beauty with my verse
    as every artist at his uttermost

such as i leave her to a greater fame
    than any of my trumpet which is bringing
    its arduous matter to a final close

with voice and gesture of a perfect leader
    she recommenced we from the greatest body
    have issued to the heaven that is pure light

light intellectual replete with love
    love of true good replete with ecstasy
    ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness

here shalt thou see the one host and the other
    of paradise and one in the same aspects
    which at the final judgment thou shalt see

even as a sudden lightning that disperses
    the visual spirits so that it deprives
    the eye of impress from the strongest objects

thus round about me flashed a living light
    and left me swathed around with such a veil
    of its effulgence that i nothing saw

ever the love which quieteth this heaven
    welcomes into itself with such salute
    to make the candle ready for its flame

no sooner had within me these brief words
    an entrance found than i perceived myself
    to be uplifted over my own power

and i with vision new rekindled me
    such that no light whatever is so pure
    but that mine eyes were fortified against it

and light i saw in fashion of a river
    fulvid with its effulgence twixt two banks
    depicted with an admirable spring

out of this river issued living sparks
    and on all sides sank down into the flowers
    like unto rubies that are set in gold

and then as if inebriate with the odours
    they plunged again into the wondrous torrent
    and as one entered issued forth another

the high desire that now inflames and moves thee
    to have intelligence of what thou seest
    pleaseth me all the more the more it swells

but of this water it behoves thee drink
    before so great a thirst in thee be slaked
    thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes

and added the river and the topazes
    going in and out and the laughing of the herbage
    are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces

not that these things are difficult in themselves
    but the deficiency is on thy side
    for yet thou hast not vision so exalted

there is no babe that leaps so suddenly
    with face towards the milk if he awake
    much later than his usual custom is

as i did that i might make better mirrors
    still of mine eyes down stooping to the wave
    which flows that we therein be better made

and even as the penthouse of mine eyelids
    drank of it it forthwith appeared to me
    out of its length to be transformed to round

then as a folk who have been under masks
    seem other than before if they divest
    the semblance not their own they disappeared in

thus into greater pomp were changed for me
    the flowerets and the sparks so that i saw
    both of the courts of heaven made manifest

o splendour of god by means of which i saw
    the lofty triumph of the realm veracious
    give me the power to say how it i saw

there is a light above which visible
    makes the creator unto every creature
    who only in beholding him has peace

and it expands itself in circular form
    to such extent that its circumference
    would be too large a girdle for the sun

the semblance of it is all made of rays
    reflected from the top of primal motion
    which takes therefrom vitality and power

and as a hill in water at its base
    mirrors itself as if to see its beauty
    when affluent most in verdure and in flowers

so ranged aloft all round about the light
    mirrored i saw in more ranks than a thousand
    all who above there have from us returned

and if the lowest row collect within it
    so great a light how vast the amplitude
    is of this rose in its extremest leaves

my vision in the vastness and the height
    lost not itself but comprehended all
    the quantity and quality of that gladness

there near and far nor add nor take away
    for there where god immediately doth govern
    the natural law in naught is relevant

into the yellow of the rose eternal
    that spreads and multiplies and breathes an odour
    of praise unto the eververnal sun

as one who silent is and fain would speak
    me beatrice drew on and said behold
    of the white stoles how vast the convent is

behold how vast the circuit of our city
    behold our seats so filled to overflowing
    that here henceforward are few people wanting

on that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed
    for the crowns sake already placed upon it
    before thou suppest at this wedding feast

shall sit the soul  of noble henry who shall come
    to redress italy ere she be ready

blind covetousness that casts its spell upon you
    has made you like unto the little child
    who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse

and in the sacred forum then shall be
    a prefect such that openly or covert
    on the same road he will not walk with him

but long of god he will not be endured
    in holy office he shall be thrust down
    where simon magus is for his deserts

and make him of alagna lower go







in fashion then as of a snowwhite rose
    displayed itself to me the saintly host
    whom christ in his own blood had made his bride

but the other host that flying sees and sings
    the glory of him who doth enamour it
    and the goodness that created it so noble

even as a swarm of bees that sinks in flowers
    one moment and the next returns again
    to where its labour is to sweetness turned

sank into the great flower that is adorned
    with leaves so many and thence reascended
    to where its love abideth evermore

their faces had they all of living flame
    and wings of gold and all the rest so white
    no snow unto that limit doth attain

from bench to bench into the flower descending
    they carried something of the peace and ardour
    which by the fanning of their flanks they won

nor did the interposing twixt the flower
    and what was oer it of such plenitude
    of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour

because the light divine so penetrates
    the universe according to its merit
    that naught can be an obstacle against it

this realm secure and full of gladsomeness
    crowded with ancient people and with modern
    unto one mark had all its look and love

o trinal light that in a single star
    sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them
    look down upon our tempest here below

if the barbarians coming from some region
    that every day by helice is covered
    revolving with her son whom she delights in

beholding rome and all her noble works
    were wonderstruck what time the lateran
    above all mortal things was eminent

i who to the divine had from the human
    from time unto eternity had come
    from florence to a people just and sane

with what amazement must i have been filled
    truly between this and the joy it was
    my pleasure not to hear and to be mute

and as a pilgrim who delighteth him
    in gazing round the temple of his vow
    and hopes some day to retell how it was

so through the living light my way pursuing
    directed i mine eyes oer all the ranks
    now up now down and now all round about

faces i saw of charity persuasive
    embellished by his light and their own smile
    and attitudes adorned with every grace

the general form of paradise already
    my glance had comprehended as a whole
    in no part hitherto remaining fixed

and round i turned me with rekindled wish
    my lady to interrogate of things
    concerning which my mind was in suspense

one thing i meant another answered me
    i thought i should see beatrice and saw
    an old man habited like the glorious people

oerflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks
    with joy benign in attitude of pity
    as to a tender father is becoming

and she where is she instantly i said
    whence he to put an end to thy desire
    me beatrice hath sent from mine own place

and if thou lookest up to the third round
    of the first rank again shalt thou behold her
    upon the throne her merits have assigned her

without reply i lifted up mine eyes
    and saw her as she made herself a crown
    reflecting from herself the eternal rays

not from that region which the highest thunders
    is any mortal eye so far removed
    in whatsoever sea it deepest sinks

as there from beatrice my sight but this
    was nothing unto me because her image
    descended not to me by medium blurred

o lady thou in whom my hope is strong
    and who for my salvation didst endure
    in hell to leave the imprint of thy feet

of whatsoever things i have beheld
    as coming from thy power and from thy goodness
    i recognise the virtue and the grace

thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom
    by all those ways by all the expedients
    whereby thou hadst the power of doing it

preserve towards me thy magnificence
    so that this soul of mine which thou hast healed
    pleasing to thee be loosened from the body

thus i implored and she so far away
    smiled as it seemed and looked once more at me
    then unto the eternal fountain turned

and said the old man holy that thou mayst
    accomplish perfectly thy journeying
    whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me

fly with thine eyes all round about this garden
    for seeing it will discipline thy sight
    farther to mount along the ray divine

and she the queen of heaven for whom i burn
    wholly with love will grant us every grace
    because that i her faithful bernard am

as he who peradventure from croatia
    cometh to gaze at our veronica
    who through its ancient fame is never sated

but says in thought the while it is displayed
    my lord christ jesus god of very god
    now was your semblance made like unto this

even such was i while gazing at the living
    charity of the man who in this world
    by contemplation tasted of that peace

thou son of grace this jocund life began he
    will not be known to thee by keeping ever
    thine eyes below here on the lowest place

but mark the circles to the most remote
    until thou shalt behold enthroned the queen
    to whom this realm is subject and devoted

i lifted up mine eyes and as at morn
    the oriental part of the horizon
    surpasses that wherein the sun goes down

thus as if going with mine eyes from vale
    to mount i saw a part in the remoteness
    surpass in splendour all the other front

and even as there where we await the pole
    that phaeton drove badly blazes more
    the light and is on either side diminished

so likewise that pacific oriflamme
    gleamed brightest in the centre and each side
    in equal measure did the flame abate

and at that centre with their wings expanded
    more than a thousand jubilant angels saw i
    each differing in effulgence and in kind

i saw there at their sports and at their songs
    a beauty smiling which the gladness was
    within the eyes of all the other saints

and if i had in speaking as much wealth
    as in imagining i should not dare
    to attempt the smallest part of its delight

bernard as soon as he beheld mine eyes
    fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour
    his own with such affection turned to her

that it made mine more ardent to behold






absorbed in his delight that contemplator
    assumed the willing office of a teacher
    and gave beginning to these holy words

the wound that mary closed up and anointed
    she at her feet who is so beautiful
    she is the one who opened it and pierced it

within that order which the third seats make
    is seated rachel lower than the other
    with beatrice in manner as thou seest

sarah rebecca judith and her who was
    ancestress of the singer who for dole
    of the misdeed said miserere mei

canst thou behold from seat to seat descending
    down in gradation as with each ones name
    i through the rose go down from leaf to leaf

and downward from the seventh row even as
    above the same succeed the hebrew women
    dividing all the tresses of the flower

because according to the view which faith
    in christ had taken these are the partition
    by which the sacred stairways are divided

upon this side where perfect is the flower
    with each one of its petals seated are
    those who believed in christ who was to come

upon the other side where intersected
    with vacant spaces are the semicircles
    are those who looked to christ already come

and as upon this side the glorious seat
    of the lady of heaven and the other seats
    below it such a great division make

so opposite doth that of the great john
    who ever holy desert and martyrdom
    endured and afterwards two years in hell

and under him thus to divide were chosen
    francis and benedict and augustine
    and down to us the rest from round to round

behold now the high providence divine
    for one and other aspect of the faith
    in equal measure shall this garden fill

and know that downward from that rank which cleaves
    midway the sequence of the two divisions
    not by their proper merit are they seated

but by anothers under fixed conditions
    for these are spirits one and all assoiled
    before they any true election had

well canst thou recognise it in their faces
    and also in their voices puerile
    if thou regard them well and hearken to them

now doubtest thou and doubting thou art silent
    but i will loosen for thee the strong bond
    in which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast

within the amplitude of this domain
    no casual point can possibly find place
    no more than sadness can or thirst or hunger

for by eternal law has been established
    whatever thou beholdest so that closely
    the ring is fitted to the finger here

and therefore are these people festinate
    unto true life not sine causa here
    more and less excellent among themselves

the king by means of whom this realm reposes
    in so great love and in so great delight
    that no will ventureth to ask for more

in his own joyous aspect every mind
    creating at his pleasure dowers with grace
    diversely and let here the effect suffice

and this is clearly and expressly noted
    for you in holy scripture in those twins
    who in their mother had their anger roused

according to the colour of the hair
    therefore with such a grace the light supreme
    consenteth that they worthily be crowned

without then any merit of their deeds
    stationed are they in different gradations
    differing only in their first acuteness

tis true that in the early centuries
    with innocence to work out their salvation
    sufficient was the faith of parents only

after the earlier ages were completed
    behoved it that the males by circumcision
    unto their innocent wings should virtue add

but after that the time of grace had come
    without the baptism absolute of christ
    such innocence below there was retained

look now into the face that unto christ
    hath most resemblance for its brightness only
    is able to prepare thee to see christ

on her did i behold so great a gladness
    rain down borne onward in the holy minds
    created through that altitude to fly

that whatsoever i had seen before
    did not suspend me in such admiration
    nor show me such similitude of god

and the same love that first descended there
    ave maria gratia plena singing
    in front of her his wings expanded wide

unto the canticle divine responded
    from every part the court beatified
    so that each sight became serener for it

o holy father who for me endurest
    to be below here leaving the sweet place
    in which thou sittest by eternal lot

who is the angel that with so much joy
    into the eyes is looking of our queen
    enamoured so that he seems made of fire

thus i again recourse had to the teaching
    of that one who delighted him in mary
    as doth the star of morning in the sun

and he to me such gallantry and grace
    as there can be in angel and in soul
    all is in him and thus we fain would have it

because he is the one who bore the palm
    down unto mary when the son of god
    to take our burden on himself decreed

but now come onward with thine eyes as i
    speaking shall go and note the great patricians
    of this most just and merciful of empires

those two that sit above there most enrapture
    as being very near unto augusta
    are as it were the two roots of this rose

he who upon the left is near her placed
    the father is by whose audacious taste
    the human species so much bitter tastes

upon the right thou seest that ancient father
    of holy church into whose keeping christ
    the keys committed of this lovely flower

and he who all the evil days beheld
    before his death of her the beauteous bride
    who with the spear and with the nails was won

beside him sits and by the other rests
    that leader under whom on manna lived
    the people ingrate fickle and stiffnecked

opposite peter seest thou anna seated
    so well content to look upon her daughter
    her eyes she moves not while she sings hosanna

and opposite the eldest household father
    lucia sits she who thy lady moved
    when to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows

but since the moments of thy vision fly
    here will we make full stop as a good tailor
    who makes the gown according to his cloth

and unto the first love will turn our eyes
    that looking upon him thou penetrate
    as far as possible through his effulgence

truly lest peradventure thou recede
    moving thy wings believing to advance
    by prayer behoves it that grace be obtained

grace from that one who has the power to aid thee
    and thou shalt follow me with thy affection
    that from my words thy heart turn not aside

and he began this holy orison







thou virgin mother daughter of thy son
    humble and high beyond all other creature
    the limit fixed of the eternal counsel

thou art the one who such nobility
    to human nature gave that its creator
    did not disdain to make himself its creature

within thy womb rekindled was the love
    by heat of which in the eternal peace
    after such wise this flower has germinated

here unto us thou art a noonday torch
    of charity and below there among mortals
    thou art the living fountainhead of hope

lady thou art so great and so prevailing
    that he who wishes grace nor runs to thee
    his aspirations without wings would fly

not only thy benignity gives succour
    to him who asketh it but oftentimes
    forerunneth of its own accord the asking

in thee compassion is in thee is pity
    in thee magnificence in thee unites
    whateer of goodness is in any creature

now doth this man who from the lowest depth
    of the universe as far as here has seen
    one after one the spiritual lives

supplicate thee through grace for so much power
    that with his eyes he may uplift himself
    higher towards the uttermost salvation

and i who never burned for my own seeing
    more than i do for his all of my prayers
    proffer to thee and pray they come not short

that thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud
    of his mortality so with thy prayers
    that the chief pleasure be to him displayed

still farther do i pray thee queen who canst
    whateer thou wilt that sound thou mayst preserve
    after so great a vision his affections

let thy protection conquer human movements
    see beatrice and all the blessed ones
    my prayers to second clasp their hands to thee

the eyes beloved and revered of god
    fastened upon the speaker showed to us
    how grateful unto her are prayers devout

then unto the eternal light they turned
    on which it is not credible could be
    by any creature bent an eye so clear

and i who to the end of all desires
    was now approaching even as i ought
    the ardour of desire within me ended

bernard was beckoning unto me and smiling
    that i should upward look but i already
    was of my own accord such as he wished

because my sight becoming purified
    was entering more and more into the ray
    of the high light which of itself is true

from that time forward what i saw was greater
    than our discourse that to such vision yields
    and yields the memory unto such excess

even as he is who seeth in a dream
    and after dreaming the imprinted passion
    remains and to his mind the rest returns not

even such am i for almost utterly
    ceases my vision and distilleth yet
    within my heart the sweetness born of it

even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed
    even thus upon the wind in the light leaves
    were the soothsayings of the sibyl lost

o light supreme that dost so far uplift thee
    from the conceits of mortals to my mind
    of what thou didst appear relend a little

and make my tongue of so great puissance
    that but a single sparkle of thy glory
    it may bequeath unto the future people

for by returning to my memory somewhat
    and by a little sounding in these verses
    more of thy victory shall be conceived

i think the keenness of the living ray
    which i endured would have bewildered me
    if but mine eyes had been averted from it

and i remember that i was more bold
    on this account to bear so that i joined
    my aspect with the glory infinite

o grace abundant by which i presumed
    to fix my sight upon the light eternal
    so that the seeing i consumed therein

i saw that in its depth far down is lying
    bound up with love together in one volume
    what through the universe in leaves is scattered

substance and accident and their operations
    all interfused together in such wise
    that what i speak of is one simple light

the universal fashion of this knot
    methinks i saw since more abundantly
    in saying this i feel that i rejoice

one moment is more lethargy to me
    than five and twenty centuries to the emprise
    that startled neptune with the shade of argo

my mind in this wise wholly in suspense
    steadfast immovable attentive gazed
    and evermore with gazing grew enkindled

in presence of that light one such becomes
    that to withdraw therefrom for other prospect
    it is impossible he eer consent

because the good which object is of will
    is gathered all in this and out of it
    that is defective which is perfect there

shorter henceforward will my language fall
    of what i yet remember than an infants
    who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast

not because more than one unmingled semblance
    was in the living light on which i looked
    for it is always what it was before

but through the sight that fortified itself
    in me by looking one appearance only
    to me was ever changing as i changed

within the deep and luminous subsistence
    of the high light appeared to me three circles
    of threefold colour and of one dimension

and by the second seemed the first reflected
    as iris is by iris and the third
    seemed fire that equally from both is breathed

o how all speech is feeble and falls short
    of my conceit and this to what i saw
    is such tis not enough to call it little

o light eterne sole in thyself that dwellest
    sole knowest thyself and known unto thyself
    and knowing lovest and smilest on thyself

that circulation which being thus conceived
    appeared in thee as a reflected light
    when somewhat contemplated by mine eyes

within itself of its own very colour
    seemed to me painted with our effigy
    wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein

as the geometrician who endeavours
    to square the circle and discovers not
    by taking thought the principle he wants

even such was i at that new apparition
    i wished to see how the image to the circle
    conformed itself and how it there finds place

but my own wings were not enough for this
    had it not been that then my mind there smote
    a flash of lightning wherein came its wish

here vigour failed the lofty fantasy
    but now was turning my desire and will
    even as a wheel that equally is moved

the love which moves the sun and the other stars









oft have i seen at some cathedral door
    a laborer pausing in the dust and heat
    lay down his burden and with reverent feet
    enter and cross himself and on the floor
kneel to repeat his paternoster oer
    far off the noises of the world retreat
    the loud vociferations of the street
    become an undistinguishable roar
so as i enter here from day to day
    and leave my burden at this minster gate
    kneeling in prayer and not ashamed to pray
the tumult of the time disconsolate
    to inarticulate murmurs dies away
    while the eternal ages watch and wait




how strange the sculptures that adorn these towers
    this crowd of statues in whose folded sleeves
    birds build their nests while canopied with leaves
    parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers
and the vast minster seems a cross of flowers
    but fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves
    watch the dead christ between the living thieves
    and underneath the traitor judas lowers
ah from what agonies of heart and brain
    what exultations trampling on despair
    what tenderness what tears what hate of wrong
what passionate outcry of a soul in pain
    uprose this poem of the earth and air
    this mediaeval miracle of song




i enter and i see thee in the gloom
    of the long aisles o poet saturnine
    and strive to make my steps keep pace with thine
    the air is filled with some unknown perfume
the congregation of the dead make room
    for thee to pass the votive tapers shine
    like rooks that haunt ravennas groves of pine
    the hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb
from the confessionals i hear arise
    rehearsals of forgotten tragedies
    and lamentations from the crypts below
and then a voice celestial that begins
    with the pathetic words although your sins
    as scarlet be and ends with as the snow




with snowwhite veil and garments as of flame
    she stands before thee who so long ago
    filled thy young heart with passion and the woe
    from which thy song in all its splendors came
and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name
    the ice about thy heart melts as the snow
    on mountain heights and in swift overflow
    comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame
thou makest full confession and a gleam
    as of the dawn on some dark forest cast
    seems on thy lifted forehead to increase
lethe and eunoethe remembered dream
    and the forgotten sorrowbring at last
    that perfect pardon which is perfect peace



i lift mine eyes and all the windows blaze
    with forms of saints and holy men who died
    here martyred and hereafter glorified
    and the great rose upon its leaves displays
christs triumph and the angelic roundelays
    with splendor upon splendor multiplied
    and beatrice again at dantes side
    no more rebukes but smiles her words of praise
and then the organ sounds and unseen choirs
    sing the old latin hymns of peace and love
    and benedictions of the holy ghost
and the melodious bells among the spires
    oer all the housetops and through heaven above
    proclaim the elevation of the host




o star of morning and of liberty
    o bringer of the light whose splendor shines
    above the darkness of the apennines
    forerunner of the day that is to be
the voices of the city and the sea
    the voices of the mountains and the pines
    repeat thy song till the familiar lines
    are footpaths for the thought of italy
thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights
    through all the nations and a sound is heard
    as of a mighty wind and men devout
strangers of rome and the new proselytes
    in their own language hear thy wondrous word
    and many are amazed and many doubt



of peleus son achilles sing o muse
the vengeance deep and deadly whence to greece
unnumbered ills arose which many a soul
of mighty warriors to the viewless shades
untimely sent they on the battle plain
unburied lay a prey to ravning dogs
and carrion birds but so had jove decreed
from that sad day when first in wordy war
the mighty agamemnon king of men
confronted stood by peleus godlike son

say then what god the fatal strife provokd
joves and latonas son he filled with wrath
against the king with deadly pestilence
the camp afflictedand the people died
for chryses sake his priest whom atreus son
with scorn dismissd when to the grecian ships
he came his captive daughter to redeem
with costly ransom chargd and in his hand
the sacred fillet of his god he bore
and golden staff to all he sued but chief
to atreus sons twin captains of the host
ye sons of atreus and ye wellgreavd greeks
may the great gods who on olympus dwell
grant you yon hostile city to destroy
and home return in safety but my child
restore i pray her profferd ransom take
and in his priest the lord of light revere

then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran
the priest to revrence and the ransom take
not so atrides he with haughty mien
and bitter speech the trembling sire addressd
old man i warn thee that beside our ships
i find thee not or lingring now or back
returning lest thou prove of small avail
thy golden staff and fillet of thy god
her i release not till her youth be fled
within my walls in argos far from home
her lot is cast domestic cares to ply
and share a masters bed for thee begone
incense me not lest ill betide thee now

he said the old man trembled and obeyed
beside the manydashing oceans shore
silent he passd and all apart he prayd
to great apollo fair latonas son

hear me god of the silver bow whose care
chrysa surrounds and cilias lovely vale
whose sovreign sway oer tenedos extends
o smintheus hear if eer my offered gifts
found favour in thy sight if eer to thee
i burnd the fat of bulls and choicest goats
grant me this boonupon the grecian host
let thine unerring darts avenge my tears

thus as he prayd his prayr apollo heard
along olympus heights he passd his heart
burning with wrath behind his shoulders hung
his bow and ample quiver at his back
rattled the fateful arrows as he movd
like the nightcloud he passd and from afar
he bent against the ships and sped the bolt
and fierce and deadly twangd the silver bow
first on the mules and dogs on man the last
was pourd the arrowy storm and through the camp
constant and numrous blazd the funral fires

nine days the heavnly archer on the troops
hurld his dread shafts the tenth th assembled greeks
achilles calld to council so inspird
by juno whitearmd goddess who beheld
with pitying eyes the wasting hosts of greece
when all were met and closely throngd around
rose the swiftfooted chief and thus began

great son of atreus to my mind there seems
if we would scape from death one only course
home to retrace our steps since here at once
by war and pestilence our forces waste
but seek we first some prophet or some priest
or some wise visionseer  who may the cause explain
which with such deadly wrath apollo fires
if for neglected hecatombs or prayrs
he blame us or if fat of lambs and goats
may soothe his anger and the plague assuage

this said he sat and thestors son arose
calchas the chief of seers to whom were known
the present and the future and the past
who by his mystic art apollos gift
guided to iliums shore the grecian fleet
who thus with cautious speech replied and said
achilles lovd of heavn thou biddst me say
why thus incensd the fardestroying king
therefore i speak but promise thou and swear
by word and hand to bear me harmless through
for well i know my speech must one offend
the argive chief oer all the greeks supreme
and terrible to men of low estate
the anger of a king for though awhile
he veil his wrath yet in his bosom pent
it still is nursd until the time arrive
say then wilt thou protect me if i speak

him answerd thus achilles swift of foot
speak boldly out whateer thine art can tell
for by apollos self i swear whom thou
o calchas servst and who thy words inspires
that while i live and see the light of heavn
not one of all the greeks shall dare on thee
beside our ships injurious hands to lay
no not if agamemnons self were he
who mid our warriors boasts the foremost place

emboldend thus th unerring prophet spoke
not for neglected hecatombs or prayrs
but for his priest whom agamemnon scornd
nor took his ransom nor his child restord
on his account the fardestroyer sends
this scourge of pestilence and yet will send
nor shall we cease his heavy hand to feel
till to her sire we give the brighteyd girl
unbought unransomd and to chrysas shore
a solemn hecatomb despatch this done
the god appeasd his anger may remit

this said he sat and atreus godlike son
the mighty monarch agamemnon rose
his dark soul filld with fury and his eyes
flashing like flames of fire on calchas first
a withring glance he cast and thus he spoke

prophet of ill thou never speakst to me
but words of evil omen for thy soul
delights to augur ill but aught of good
thou never yet hast promisd nor performd
and now among the greeks thou spreadst abroad
thy lying prophecies that all these ills
come from the fardestroyer for that i
refusd the ransom of my lovely prize
and that i rather chose herself to keep
to me not less than clytemnestra dear
my virginwedded wife nor less adornd
in gifts of form of feature or of mind
yet if it must he so i give her back
i wish my peoples safety not their death
but seek me out forthwith some other spoil
lest emptyhanded i alone appear
of all the greeks for this would ill beseem
and how i lose my present share ye see

to whom achilles swift of foot replied
haughtiest of men and greediest of the prey
how shall our valiant greeks for thee seek out
some other spoil no common fund have we
of hoarded treasures what our arms have won
from capturd towns has been already shard
nor can we now resume th apportiond spoil
restore the maid obedient to the god
and if heavn will that we the strongbuilt walls
of troy should raze our warriors will to thee
a threefold fourfold recompense assign

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
think not achilles valiant though thou art
in fight and godlike to defraud me thus
thou shalt not so persuade me nor oerreach
thinkst thou to keep thy portion of the spoil
while i with empty hands sit humbly down
the brighteyd girl thou biddst me to restore
if then the valiant greeks for me seek out
some other spoil some compensation just
tis well if not i with my own right hand
will from some other chief from thee perchance
or ajax or ulysses wrest his prey
and woe to him on whomsoeer i call
but this for future counsel we remit
haste we then now our darkribbd bark to launch
muster a fitting crew and place on board
the sacred hecatomb then last embark
the fair chryseis and in chief command
let some one of our councillors be placd
ajax ulysses or idomeneus
or thou the most ambitious of them all
that so our rites may soothe the angry god

to whom achilles thus with scornful glance
oh clothd in shamelessness oh sordid soul
how canst thou hope that any greek for thee
will brave the toils of travel or of war
well dost thou know that t was no feud of mine
with troys brave sons that brought me here in arms
they never did me wrong they never drove
my cattle or my horses never sought
in phthias fertile lifesustaining fields
to waste the crops for wide between us lay
the shadowy mountains and the roaring sea
with thee o void of shame with thee we saild
for menelaus and for thee ingrate
glory and fame on trojan crests to win
all this hast thou forgotten or despisd
and threatnest now to wrest from me the prize
i labourd hard to win and greeks bestowd
nor does my portion ever equal thine
when on some populous town our troops have made
successful war in the contentious fight
the larger portion of the toil is mine
but when the day of distribution comes
thine is the richest spoil while i forsooth
must be too well content to bear on board
some paltry prize for all my warlike toil
to phthia now i go so better far
to steer my homeward course and leave thee here
but little like i deem dishonouring me
to fill thy coffers with the spoils of war

whom answerd agamemnon king of men
fly then if such thy mind i ask thee not
on mine account to stay others there are
will guard my honour and avenge my cause
and chief of all the lord of counsel jove
of all the heavnborn kings thou art the man
i hate the most for thou delightst in nought
but war and strife thy prowess i allow
yet this remember is the gift of heavn
return then with thy vessels if thou wilt
and with thy followers home and lord it there
over thy myrmidons i heed thee not
i care not for thy fury hear my threat
since phoebus wrests chryseis from my arms
in mine own ship and with mine own good crew
her i send forth and in her stead i mean
evn from thy tent myself to bear thy prize
the fair briseis that henceforth thou know
how far i am thy master and that taught
by thine example others too may fear
to rival me and brave me to my face

thus while he spake achilles chafd with rage
and in his manly breast his heart was torn
with thoughts conflictingwhether from his side
to draw his mighty sword and thrusting by
th assembled throng to kill th insulting king
or school his soul and keep his anger down
but while in mind and spirit thus he musd
and half unsheathd his sword from heavn came down
minerva sent by juno whitearmd queen
whose love and care both chiefs alike enjoyd
she stood behind and by the yellow hair
she held the son of peleus visible
to him alone by all the rest unseen
achilles wondring turnd and straight he knew
the blueeyed pallas awful was her glance
whom thus the chief with winged words addressd

why comst thou child of aegisbearing jove
to see the arrogance of atreus son
but this i say and will make good my words
this insolence may cost him soon his life

to whom the blueeyd goddess thus replied
from heavn i came to curb if thou wilt hear
thy fury sent by juno whitearmd queen
whose love and care ye both alike enjoy
cease then these broils and draw not thus thy sword
in words indeed assail him as thou wilt
but this i promise and will make it good
the time shall come when for this insolence
a threefold compensation shall be thine
only be swayd by me and curb thy wrath

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
goddess i needs must yield to your commands
indignant though i befor so tis best
who hears the gods of them his prayrs are heard

he said and on the silver hilt he stayd
his powrful hand and flung his mighty sword
back to its scabbard to minervas word
obedient she her heavnward course pursued
to join th immortals in th abode of jove
but peleus son with undiminishd wrath
atrides thus with bitter words addressd

thou sot with eye of dog and heart of deer
who never darst to lead in armed fight
th assembled host nor with a chosen few
to man the secret ambushfor thou fearst
to look on deathno doubt tis easier far
girt with thy troops to plunder of his right
whoeer may venture to oppose thy will
a tyrant king because thou rulst oer slaves
were it not so this insult were thy last
but this i say and with an oath confirm
by this my royal staff which never more
shall put forth leaf nor spray since first it left
upon the mountainside its parent stem
nor blossom more since all around the axe
hath loppd both leaf and bark and now tis borne
emblem of justice by the sons of greece
who guard the sacred ministry of law
before the face of jove a mighty oath
the time shall come when all the sons of greece
shall mourn achilles loss and thou the while
heartrent shalt be allimpotent to aid
when by the warriorslayer hectors hand
many shall fall and then thy soul shall mourn
the slight on grecias bravest warrior cast

thus spoke pelides and upon the ground
he cast his staff with golden studs embossd
and took his seat on th other side in wrath
atrides burnd but nestor interposd
nestor the leader of the pylian host
the smoothtongued chief from whose persuasive lips
sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech
two generations of the sons of men
for him were past and gone who with himself
were born and bred on pylos lovely shore
and oer the third he now held royal sway
he thus with prudent words the chiefs addressd

alas alas what grief is this for greece
what joy for priam and for priams sons
what exultation for the men of troy
to hear of feuds tween you of all the greeks
the first in council and the first in fight
yet hear my words i pray in years at least
ye both must yield to me and in times past
i livd with men and they despisd me not
abler in counsel greater than yourselves
such men i never saw and neer shall see
as pirithous and dryas wise and brave
coeneus exadius godlike polypheme
and theseus ægeus more than mortal son
the mightiest they among the sons of men
the mightiest they and of the forest beasts
strove with the mightiest and their rage subdued
with them from distant lands from pylos shore
i joind my forces and their call obeyd
with them i playd my part with them not one
would dare to fight of mortals now on earth
yet they my counsels heard my voice obeyd
and hear ye also for my words are wise
nor thou though great thou be attempt to rob
achilles of his prize but let him keep
the spoil assignd him by the sons of greece
nor thou pelides with the monarch strive
in rivalry for neer to sceptred king
hath jove such powrs as to atrides givn
and valiant though thou art and goddessborn
yet mightier he for wider is his sway
atrides curb thy wrath while i beseech
achilles to forbear in whom the greeks
from adverse war their great defender see

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
o father full of wisdom are thy words
but this proud chief oer all would domineer
oer all he seeks to rule oer all to reign
to all to dictate which i will not bear
grant that the gods have givn him warlike might
gave they unbridled license to his tongue

to whom achilles interrupting thus
coward and slave indeed i might be deemd
could i submit to make thy word my law
to others thy commands seek not to me
to dictate for i follow thee no more
but hear me speak and ponder what i say
for the fair girl i fight not 
with thee or any one but of the rest
my dark swift ship contains against my will
on nought shalt thou unpunishd lay thy hand
make trial if thou wilt that these may know
thy lifeblood soon should reek upon my spear

after this conflict keen of angry speech
the chiefs arose the assembly was dispersd

with his own followers and menoetius son
achilles to his tents and ships withdrew
but atreus son launchd a swiftsailing bark
with twenty rowers mannd and placd on board
the sacred hecatomb then last embarkd
the fair chryseis and in chief command
laertes son the sage ulysses placd
they swiftly sped along the watry way

next proclamation through the camp was made
to purify the host and in the sea
obedient to the word they purified
then to apollo solemn rites performd
with faultless hecatombs of bulls and goats
upon the margin of the watry waste
and wreathd in smoke the savour rose to heavn

the camp thus occupied the king pursued
his threatend plan of vengeance to his side
calling talthybius and eurybates
heralds and faithful followers thus he spoke

haste to achilles tent and in your hand
back with you thence the fair briseis bring
if he refuse to send her i myself
with a sufficient force will bear her thence
which he may find perchance the worse for him

so spake the monarch and with stern command
dismissd them with reluctant steps they passd
along the margin of the watry waste
till to the tents and ships they came where lay
the warlike myrmidons their chief they found
sitting beside his tent and darkribbd ship
achilles markd their coming not well pleasd
with troubled mien and awestruck by the king
they stood nor dard accost him but himself
divind their errand and addressd them thus

welcome ye messengers of gods and men
heralds approach in safety not with you
but with atrides is my just offence
who for the fair briseis sends you here
go then patroclus bring the maiden forth
and give her to their hands but witness ye
before the blessed gods and mortal men
and to the face of that injurious king
when he shall need my arm from shameful rout
to save his followers blinded by his rage
he neither heeds experience of the past
nor scans the future provident how best
to guard his fleet and army from the foe

he spoke obedient to his friend and chief
patroclus led the fair briseis forth
and gave her to their hands they to the ships
retracd their steps and with them the fair girl
reluctant went meanwhile achilles plungd
in bitter grief from all the band apart
upon the margin of the hoary sea
sat idly gazing on the darkblue waves
and to his goddessmother long he prayd
with outstretchd hands oh mother since thy son
to early death by destiny is doomd
i might have hopd the thunderer on high
olympian jove with honour would have crownd
my little space but now disgrace is mine
since agamemnon the wideruling king
hath wrested from me and still holds my prize

weeping he spoke his goddessmother heard
beside her aged father where she sat
in the deep oceancaves ascending quick
through the dark waves like to a misty cloud
beside her son she stood and as he wept
she gently touchd him with her hand and said
why weeps my son and whence his cause of grief
speak out that i may hear and share thy pain

to whom achilles swift of foot replied
groaning thou knowst what boots to tell thee all
on thebes we marchd eetions sacred town
and stormd the walls and hither bore the spoil
the spoils were fairly by the sons of greece
apportiond out and to atrides share
the beauteous daughter of old chryses fell
chryses apollos priest to free his child
came to th encampment of the brassclad greeks
with costly ransom chargd and in his hand
the sacred fillet of his god he bore
and golden staff to all he sued but chief
to atreus sons twin captains of the host
then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran
the priest to revrence and the ransom take
not so atrides he with haughty mien
and bitter words the trembling sire dismissd
the old man turnd in sorrow but his prayr
phoebus apollo heard who lovd him well
against the greeks he bent his fatal bow
and fast the people fell on evry side
throughout the camp the heavnly arrows flew
a skilful seer at length the cause reveald
why thus incensd the archergod i then
the first gave counsel to appease his wrath
whereat atrides full of fury rose
and utterd threats which he hath now fulfilld
for chryses daughter to her native land
in a swiftsailing ship the keeneyd greeks
have sent with costly offrings to the god
but her assignd me by the sons of greece
brises fair daughter from my tent een now
the heralds bear away then goddess thou
if thou hast powr protect thine injurd son
fly to olympus to the feet of jove
and make thy prayr to him if on his heart
thou hast in truth by word or deed a claim
for i remember in my fathers house
i oft have heard thee boast how thou alone
of all th immortals saturns cloudgirt son
didst shield from foul disgrace when all the rest
juno and neptune and minerva joind
with chains to bind him then o goddess thou
didst set him free invoking to his aid
him of the hundred arms whom briareus
th immortal gods and men ægeon call
he mightier than his father took his seat
by saturns side in pride of conscious strength
fear seizd on all the gods nor did they dare
to bind their king of this remind him now
and clasp his knees and supplicate his aid
for troys brave warriors that the routed greeks
back to their ships with slaughter may be drivn
that all may taste the folly of their king
and agamemnons haughty self may mourn
the slight on grecias bravest warrior cast

thus he and thetis weeping thus replied
alas my child that eer i gave thee birth
would that beside thy ships thou couldst remain
from grief exempt and insult since by fate
few years are thine and not a lengthened term
at once to early death and sorrows doomd
beyond the lot of man in evil hour
i gave thee birth but to the snowclad heights
of great olympus to the throne of jove
who wields the thunder thy complaints i bear
thou by thy ships meanwhile against the greeks
thine anger nurse and from the fight abstain
for jove is to a solemn banquet gone
beyond the sea on æthiopias shore
since yesternight and with him all the gods
on the twelfth day he purposd to return
to high olympus thither then will i
and to his feet my supplication make
and he i think will not deny my suit

this said she disappeard and left him there
musing in anger on the lovely form
tom from his arms by violence away

meantime ulysses with his sacred freight
arrivd at chrysas strand and when his bark
had reachd the shelter of the deep sea bay
their sails they furld and lowerd to the hold
slackd the retaining shrouds and quickly struck
and stowd away the mast then with their sweeps
pulld for the beach and cast their anchors out
and made her fast with cables to the shore
then on the shingly breakwater themselves
they landed and the sacred hecatomb
to great apollo and chryseis last
her to the altar straight ulysses led
the wise in counsel in her fathers hand
he placd the maiden and addressd him thus
chryses from agamemnon king of men
to thee i come thy daughter to restore
and to thy god upon the greeks behalf
to offer sacrifice if haply so
we may appease his wrath who now incensd
with grievous suffring visits all our host
then to her sire he gave her he with joy
receivd his child the sacred hecatomb
around the wellbuilt altar for the god
in order due they placd their hands then washed
and the salt cake prepard before them all
with hands uplifted chryses prayd aloud

hear me god of the silver bow whose care
chrysa surrounds and cillas lovely vale
whose sovreign sway oer tenedos extends
once hast thou heard my prayr avengd my cause
and pourd thy fury on the grecian host
hear yet again and grant what now i ask
withdraw thy chastning hand and stay the plague

thus as he prayd his prayr apollo heard
their prayrs concluded and the salt cake strewd
upon the victims heads they drew them back
and slew and flayd then cutting from the thighs
the choicest pieces and in double layers
oerspreading them with fat above them placd
the due meatoffrings then the aged priest
the cleft wood kindled and libations pourd
of ruddy wine armd with the fiveforkd prongs
th attendant ministers beside him stood
the thighs consumd with fire the inward parts
they tasted first the rest upon the spits
roasted with care and from the fire withdrew
their labours ended and the feast prepard
they shared the social meal nor lacked there aught
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
th attendant youths the flowing goblets crownd
and in fit order servd the cups to all
all day they sought the favour of the god
the glorious paeans chanting and the praise
of phoebus he well pleasd the strain receivd
but when the sun was set and shades of night
oerspread the sky upon the sandy beach
close to their ship they laid them down to rest
and when the rosyfingerd morn appeard
back to the camp they took their homeward way
a favring breeze the fardestroyer sent
they steppd the mast and spread the snowy sail
full in the midst the bellying sail receivd
the gallant breeze and round the vessels prow
the dark waves loudly roard as on she rushd
skimming the seas and cut her watry way
arrivd where lay the widespread host of greece
their darkribbd vessel on the beach they drew
high on the sand and strongly shord her up
then through the camp they took their sevral ways

meantime beside the ships achilles sat
the heavnborn son of peleus swift of foot
chafing with rage repressd no more he sought
the honourd council nor the battlefield
but wore his soul away and inly pind
for the fierce joy and tumult of the fight
but when the twelfth revolving day was come
back to olympus heights th immortal gods
jove at their head together all returnd
then thetis mindful of her sons request
rose from the ocean wave and sped in haste
to high olympus and the courts of heavn
th allseeing son of saturn there she found
sitting apart upon the topmost crest
of manyridgd olympus at his feet
she sat and while her left hand claspd his knees
her right approached his beard and suppliant thus
she made her prayr to saturns royal son

father if eer amid th immortal gods
by word or deed i did thee service true
hear now my prayr avenge my hapless son
of mortals shortestlivd insulted now
by mighty agamemnon king of men
and plunderd of his lawful spoils of war
but jove olympian lord of counsel thou
avenge his cause and give to trojan arms
such strength and powr that greeks may learn how much
they need my son and give him honour due

she said the cloudcompeller answerd not
but silent sat then thetis claspd his knees
and hung about him and her suit renewd

give me thy promise sure thy gracious nod
or else refuse 
that i may learn of all th immortal gods
how far i stand the lowest in thine eyes

then much disturbd the cloudcompeller spoke
sad work thou makst in bidding me oppose
my will to junos when her bitter words
assail me for full oft amid the gods
she taunts me that i aid the trojan cause
but thou return that juno see thee not
and leave to me the furthrance of thy suit
lo to confirm thy faith i nod my head
and well among th immortal gods is known
the solemn import of that pledge from me
for neer my promise shall deceive or fail
or be recalld if with a nod confirmd

he said and nodded with his shadowy brows
wavd on th immortal head th ambrosial locks
and all olympus trembled at his nod
they parted thus from bright olympus heights
the goddess hasted to her oceancaves
jove to his palace at his entrance all
rose from their seats at once not one presumd
to wait his coming but advancd to meet
then on his throne he sat but not unmarkd
of junos eye had been the council held
in secret with the silverfooted queen
the daughter of the aged oceangod
and with sharp words she thus addressed her lord

tell me deceiver who was she with whom
thou late heldst council ever tis thy way
apart from me to weave thy secret schemes
nor dost thou freely share with me thy mind

to whom the sire of gods and men replied
expect not juno all my mind to know
my wife thou art yet would such knowledge be
too much for thee whateer i deem it fit
that thou shouldst know nor god nor man shall hear
before thee but what i in secret plan
seek not to know nor curiously inquire

whom answerd thus the stageyd queen of heavn
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
neer have i sought or now or heretofore
thy secret thoughts to know what thou thinkst fit
to tell i wait thy gracious will to hear
yet fear i in my soul thou art beguild
by wiles of thetis silverfooted queen
the daughter of the aged oceangod
for she was with thee early and embracd
thy knees and has i think thy promise sure
thou wilt avenge achilles cause and bring
destructive slaughter on the grecian host

to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
presumptuous to thy busy thoughts thou givst
too free a range and watchest all i do
yet shalt thou not prevail but rather thus
be aliend from my heartthe worse for thee
if this be so it is my sovreign will
but now keep silence and my words obey
lest all th immortals fail if i be wroth
to rescue thee from my resistless hand

he said and terror seizd the stageyd queen
silent she sat curbing her spirit down
and all the gods in pitying sorrow mournd
vulcan the skilld artificer then first
broke silence and with soothing words addressd
his mother juno whitearmd queen of heavn
sad weret indeed and grievous to be borne
if for the sake of mortal men you two
should suffer angry passions to arise
and kindle broils in heavn so should our feast
by evil influence all its sweetness lack
let me advise my mother 
to speak my father fair lest he again
reply in anger and our banquet mar
for jove the lightnings lord if such his will
might hurl us from our seats 
but thou address him still with gentle words
so shall his favour soon again be ours

this said he rose and in his mothers hand
a double goblet placd as thus he spoke
have patience mother mine though much enforcd
restrain thy spirit lest perchance these eyes
dear as thou art behold thee brought to shame
and i though grievd in heart be impotent
to save thee for tis hard to strive with jove
when to thy succour once before i came
he seizd me by the foot and hurld me down
from heavns high threshold all the day i fell
and with the setting sun on lemnos isle
lighted scarce half alive there was i found
and by the sintian people kindly nursd

thus as he spoke the whitearmed goddess smild
and smiling from his hand receivd the cup
then to th immortals all in order due
he ministerd and from the flagon pourd
the luscious nectar while among the gods
rose laughter irrepressible at sight
of vulcan hobbling round the spacious hall

thus they till sunset passd the festive hours
nor lackd the banquet aught to please the sense
nor sound of tuneful lyre by phoebus touchd
nor muses voice who in alternate strains
responsive sang but when the sun had set
each to his home departed where for each
the crippled vulcan matchless architect
with wondrous skill a noble house had reard

to his own couch where he was wont of old
when overcome by gentle sleep to rest
olympian jove ascended there he slept
and by his side the goldenthroned queen





all night in sleep reposd the other gods
and helmed warriors but the eyes of jove
sweet slumber held not pondering in his mind
how to avenge achilles cause and pour
destructive slaughter on the grecian host
thus as he musd the wisest course appeard
by a deluding vision to mislead
the son of atreus and with winged words
thus to a phantom form he gave command
hie thee deluding vision to the camp
and ships of greece to agamemnons tent
there changing nought as i command thee speak
bid that he arm in haste the longhaird greeks
to combat for the widebuilt streets of troy
he now may capture since th immortal gods
watch over her no longer all are gaind
by junos prayrs and woes impend oer troy

he said the vision heard and straight obeyd
swiftly he sped and reached the grecian ships
and sought the son of atreus him he found
within his tent wrapped in ambrosial sleep
above his head he stood like neleus son
nestor whom agamemnon revrencd most
of all the elders in his likeness clothd
thus spoke the heavnly vision sleepst thou son
of atreus valiant warrior horseman bold
to sleep all night but ill becomes a chief
chargd with the public weal and cares of state
hear now the words i bear to thee i come
a messenger from jove who from on high
looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love
he bids thee arm in haste the longhaird greeks
to combat since the widebuilt streets of troy
thou now mayst capture for th immortal gods
watch over her no longer all are gaind
by junos prayrs and woes impend oer troy
bear this in mind and when from sleep arousd
let not my words from thy remembrance fade
this said he vanishd and the monarch left
inspird with thoughts which neer should come to pass
for in that day he vainly hopd to take
the town of priam ignorant what jove
designd in secret or what woes what groans
what lengthend labours in the stubborn fight
were yet for trojans and for greeks in store
he woke from sleep but oer his senses spread
dwelt still the heavenly voice he sat upright
he donnd his vest of texture fine newwrought
then oer it threw his ample robe and bound
his sandals fair around his wellturnd feet
and oer his shoulders flung his sword adornd
with silver studs and bearing in his hand
his royal staff ancestral to the ships
where lay the brassclad warriors bent his way

aurora now was rising up the steep
of great olympus to th immortal gods
pure light diffusing when atrides bade
the clearvoicd heralds to th assembly call
the genral host they gave the word and straight
from evry quarter throngd the eager crowd
but first of all the elders by the side
of nestors ship the aged pylian chief
a secret conclave agamemnon calld
and prudent thus the chosen few addressd
hear me my friends in the still hours of night
i saw a heavnly vision in my sleep
most like it seemed in stature form and face
to revrend nestor at my head it stood
and with these words addressd mesleepst thou son
of atreus valiant warrior horseman bold
to sleep all night but ill becomes a chief
chargd with the public weal and cares of state
hear now the words i bear to thee i come
a messenger from jove who from on high
looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love
he bids thee arm in haste the longhaird greeks
to combat since the widebuilt streets of troy
thou now mayst capture for th immortal gods
watch over her no longer all are gaind
by junos prayrs and woes impend oer troy
bear thou my words in mind thus as he spoke
he vanishd and sweet sleep forsook mine eyes
seek we then straight to arm the sons of greece
but first as is our wont myself will prove
the spirit of the army and suggest
their homeward voyage ye throughout the camp
restore their courage and restrain from flight

thus having said he sat and next arose
nestor the chief of pylos sandy shore
who thus with prudent speech replied and said
o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
if any other had this vision seen
we should have deemd it false and laughd to scorn
the idle tale but now it hath appeard
of all our army to the foremost man
seek we then straight to arm the sons of greece

he said and from the council led the way
uprose the sceptred monarchs and obeyd
their leaders call and round them throngd the crowd
as swarms of bees that pour in ceaseless stream
from out the crevice of some hollow rock
now clustring and anon mid vernal flowrs
some here some there in busy numbers fly
so to th assembly from their tents and ships
the countless tribes came thronging in their midst
by jove enkindled rumour urged them on
great was the din and as the mighty mass
sat down the solid earth beneath them groand
nine heralds raisd their voices loud to quell
the storm of tongues and bade the noisy crowd
be still and listen to the heavnborn kings

at length they all were seated and awhile
their clamours sank to silence then uprose
the monarch agamemnon in his hand
his royal staff the work of vulcans art
which vulcan to the son of saturn gave
to hermes he the heavnly messenger
hermes to pelops matchless charioteer
pelops to atreus atreus at his death
bequeathd it to thyestes wealthy lord
of numrous herds to agamemnon last
thyestes left it token of his sway
oer all the argive coast and neighbouring isles
on this the monarch leant as thus he spoke
friends grecian heroes ministers of mars
grievous and all unlookd for is the blow
which jove hath dealt me by his promise led
i hopd to raze the strongbuilt walls of troy
and home return in safety but it seems
he falsifies his word and bids me now
return to argos frustrate of my hope
dishonourd and with grievous loss of men
such now appears th oerruling sovreign will
of saturns son who oft hath sunk the heads
of many a lofty city in the dust
and yet will sink for mighty is his hand
tis shame indeed that future days should hear
how such a force as ours so great so brave
hath thus been baffled fighting as we do
gainst numbers far inferior to our own
and see no end of all our warlike toil
for should we choose on terms of plighted truce
trojans and greeks to number our array
of trojans all that dwell within the town
and we by tens disposed to every ten
to crown our cups one trojan should assign
full many a ten no cupbearer would find
so far the sons of greece outnumber all
that dwell within the town but to their aid
bold warriors come from all the cities round
who greatly harass me and render vain
my hope to storm the strongbuilt walls of troy
already now nine weary years have passd
the timbers of our ships are all decayd
the cordage rotted in our homes the while
our wives and helpless children sit in vain
expecting our return and still the work
for which we hither came remains undone
hear then my counsel let us all agree
home to direct our course since here in vain
we strive to take the wellbuilt walls of troy

thus as he spoke the crowd that had not heard
the secret council by his words was movd
so swayd and heavd the multitude as when
oer the vast billows of th icarian sea
eurus and notus from the clouds of heavn
pour forth their fury or as some deep field
of wavy corn when sweeping oer the plain
the ruffling west wind sways the bending ears
so was th assembly stirrd and towrd the ships
with clamrous joy they rushd beneath their feet
rose clouds of dust while one to other calld
to seize the ships and drag them to the main
they cleard the channels and with shouts of home
that rose to heavn they knockd the shores away
then had the greeks in shameful flight withdrawn
had juno not to pallas thus appeald
oh heavn brave child of aegisbearing jove
shall thus the greeks in ignominious flight
oer the wide sea their homeward course pursue
and as a trophy to the sons of troy
the argive helen leave on whose account
far from their home so many valiant greeks
have cast their lives away go quickly thou
amid the brassclad greeks and man by man
address with words persuasive nor permit
to launch their welltrimmd vessels on the deep

she said nor did minerva not obey
but swift descending from olympus heights
with rapid flight she reachd the grecian ships
laertes son in council sage as jove
there found she standing he no hand had laid
on his dark vessel for with bitter grief
his heart was filled the blueeyd maid approachd
and thus addressd him great laertes son
ulysses sage in council can it be
that you the men of greece embarking thus
on your swift ships in ignominious flight
oer the wide sea will take your homeward way
and as a trophy to the sons of troy
the argive helen leave on whose account
far from their homes so many valiant greeks
have cast their lives away go quickly thou
among the multitude and man by man
address with words persuasive nor permit
to launch their welltrimmd vessels on the deep

she said the heavnly voice ulysses knew
straight springing to the course he cast aside
and to eurybates of ithaca
his herald and attendant threw his robe
then to atrides hastend and by him
armd with his royal staff ancestral passd
with rapid step amid the ships of greece
each king or leader whom he found he thus
with cheering words encouragd and restraind
o gallant friend tis not for thee to yield
like meaner men to panic but thyself
sit quiet and the common herd restrain
thou knowst not yet atrides secret mind
he tries us now and may reprove us soon
his words in council reachd not all our ears
see that he work us not some ill for fierce
his anger and the lord of counsel jove
from whom proceeds all honour loves him well

but of the common herd whomeer he found
clamring he checkd with staff and threatning words
good friend keep still and hear what others say
thy betters far for thou art good for nought
of small account in council or in fight
all are not sovereigns here ill fares the state
where many masters rule let one be lord
one king supreme to whom wise saturns son
in token of his sovreign power hath givn
the sceptres sway and ministry of law

such were his words as through the ranks he passd
they from the vessels and the tents again
throngd to th assembly with such rush of sound
as when the manydashing oceans wave
breaks on the shore and foams the frothing sea
the others all were settled in their seats
only thersites with unmeasurd words
of which he had good store to rate the chiefs
not overseemly but wherewith he thought
to move the crowd to laughter brawld aloud
the ugliest man was he who came to troy
with squinting eyes and one distorted foot
his shoulders round and buried in his breast
his narrow head with scanty growth of hair
against achilles and ulysses most
his hate was turnd on them his venom pourd
anon at agamemnons self he launchd
his loudtongued ribaldry gainst him he knew
incensed the public mind and bawling loud
with scurril words he thus addressd the king
what more thou son of atreus wouldst thou have
thy tents are full of brass and in those tents
many fair women whom from all the spoil
we greeks wheneer some wealthy town we take
choose first of all and set apart for thee
or dost thou thirst for gold which here perchance
some trojan brings the ransom of his son
capturd by me or by some other greek
or some new girl to gratify thy lust
kept for thyself apart a leader thou
shouldst not to evil lead the sons of greece
ye slaves ye coward souls women of greece
i will not call you men why go we not
home with our ships and leave this mighty chief
to gloat upon his treasures and find out
whether in truth he need our aid or no
who on achilles his superior far
foul scorn hath cast and robbd him of his prize
which for himself he keeps achilles sure
is not intemperate but mild of mood
else atreus son this insult were thy last

on agamemnon leader of the host
with words like these thersites pourd his hate
but straight ulysses at his side appeard
and spoke with scornful glance in stern rebuke
thou babbling fool thersites prompt of speech
restrain thy tongue nor singly thus presume
the kings to slander thou the meanest far
of all that with the atridae came to troy
ill it beseems that such an one as thou
should lift thy voice against the kings and rail
with scurril ribaldry and prate of home
how these affairs may end we know not yet
nor how or well or ill we may return
cease then against atrides king of men
to pour thy spite for that the valiant greeks
to him despite thy railing as of right
an ample portion of the spoils assign
but this i tell thee and will make it good
if eer i find thee play the fool as now
then may these shoulders cease this head to bear
and may my son telemachus no more
own me his father if i strip not off
thy mantle and thy garments aye expose
thy nakedness and flog thee to the ships
howling and scourgd with ignominious stripes

thus as he spoke upon thersites neck
and back came down his heavy staff the wretch
shrank from the blow and scalding tears let fall
where struck the goldenstudded staff appeard
a bloody weal thersites quaild and down
quivring with pain he sat and wipd away
with horrible grimace the trickling tears
the greeks despite their anger laughd aloud
and one to other said good faith of all
the many works ulysses well hath done
wise in the council foremost in the fight
he neer hath done a better than when now
he makes this scurril babbler hold his peace
methinks his headstrong spirit will not soon
lead him again to vilify the kings

thus spoke the genral voice but staff in hand
ulysses rose minerva by his side
in likeness of a herald bade the crowd
keep silence that the greeks from first to last
might hear his words and ponder his advice
he thus with prudent phrase his speech began
great son of atreus on thy name o king
throughout the world will foul reproach be cast
if greeks forget their promise nor make good
the vow they took to thee when hitherward
we sailed from argos grassy plains to raze
ere our return the wellbuilt walls of troy
but now like helpless widows or like babes
they mourn their cruel fate and pine for home
tis hard indeed defeated to return
the seaman murmurs if from wife and home
evn for one month his wellfound bark be stayd
tossd by the wintry blasts and stormy sea
but us the ninth revolving year beholds
still lingring here i cannot therefore blame
our valiant greeks if by the ships i hear
their murmurs yet twere surely worst of all
long to remain and bootless to return
bear up my friends remain awhile and see
if calchas truly prophesy or no
for this ye all have seen and can yourselves
bear witness all who yet are spard by fate
not long ago when ships of greece were met
at aulis chargd with evil freight for troy
and we around a fountain to the gods
our altars reard with faultless hecatombs
near a fair planetree where bright water flowd
behold a wonder by olympian jove
sent forth to light a snake with burnishd scales
of aspect fearful issuing from beneath
the altars glided to the planetree straight
there on the topmost bough beneath the leaves
cowring a sparrows callow nestlings lay
eight fledglings and the parent bird the ninth
all the eight nestlings uttring piercing cries
the snake devourd and as the mother flew
lamenting oer her offspring round and round
uncoiling caught her shrieking by the wing
then when the sparrows nestlings and herself
the snake had swallowed by the god who first
sent him to light a miracle was wrought
for jove the deepdesigning saturns son
turnd him to stone we stood and wondring gazd
but when this prodigy befell our rites
calchas inspird of heaven took up his speech
ye longhaired sons of greece why stand ye thus
in mute amaze to us olympian jove
to whom be endless praise vouchsafes this sign
late sent of late fulfilment as ye saw
the snake devour the sparrow and her young
eight nestlings and the parent bird the ninth
so for so many years are we condemnd
to wage a fruitless war but in the tenth
the widebuilt city shall at last be ours
thus he foretold and now the time is come
here then ye wellgreavd greeks let all remain
till priams wealthy city be our own

he said and loudly cheerd the greeksand loud
from all the hollow ships came back the cheers
in admiration of ulysses speech
gerenian nestor next took up the word
like children grecian warriors ye debate
like babes to whom unknown are feats of arms
where then are now our solemn covenants
our plighted oaths go cast we to the fire
our councils held our warriors plans maturd
our absolute pledges and our handplight givn
in which our trust was placed since thus in vain
in words we wrangle and how long soeer
we here remain solution none we find
atrides thou as is thy wont maintain
unchangd thy counsel for the stubborn fight
array the greeks and let perdition seize
those few those two or three among the host
who hold their separate counselrather than return
to argos ere we prove if jove indeed
will falsify his promisd word or no
for well i ween that on the day when first
we grecians hitherward our course addressd
to troy the messengers of blood and death
th oerruling son of saturn on our right
his lightning flashing with auspicious sign
assurd us of his favour let not then
the thoughts of home be breathd ere trojan wives
given to our warriors retribution pay
for wrongs by us in helens cause sustaind
but whoso longs if such an one there be
to make his homeward voyage let him take
his wellriggd bark and go before the rest
to meet the doom of death but thou o king
be well advisd thyself and others lead
by wholesome counsel for the words i speak
are not to be despisd by tribes and clans
o agamemnon range thy troops that so
tribe may to tribe give aid and clan to clan
if thus thou do and greeks thy words obey
then shalt thou see of chiefs and troops alike
the good and bad for on their own behoof
they all shall fight and if thou fail shalt know
whether thy failure be of heavns decree
or mans default and ignorance of war

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
father in council of the sons of greece
none can compare with thee and would to jove
to pallas and apollo at my side
i had but ten such counsellors as thee
then soon should royal priams city fall
takn and destroyd by our victorious hands
but now on me hath aegisbearing jove
the son of saturn fruitless toil imposd
and hurtful quarrels for in wordy war
about a girl achilles and myself
engagd and i alas the strife began
could we be friends again delay were none
how short soeer of iliums final doom
but now to breakfast ere we wage the fight
each sharpen well his spear his shield prepare
each to his fiery steeds their forage give
each look his chariot oer that through the day
we may unwearied stem the tide of war
for respite none how short soeer shall be
till night shall bid the storm of battle cease
with sweat shall reek upon each warriors breast
the leathern belt beneath the covring shield
and hands shall ache that wield the pondrous spear
with sweat shall reek the fiery steeds that draw
each warriors car but whomsoeer i find
loitring beside the beaked ships for him
twere hard toscape the vultures and the dogs

he said and from th applauding ranks of greece
rose a loud sound as when the ocean wave
drivn by the south wind on some lofty beach
dashes against a prominent crag exposd
to blasts from every storm that roars around
uprising then and through the camp dispersd
they took their sevral ways and by their tents
the fires they lighted and the meal prepard
and each to some one of the immortal gods
his offring made that in the coming fight
he might escape the bitter doom of death
but to the oerruling son of saturn jove
a sturdy ox wellfattend five years old
atrides slew and to the banquet calld
the aged chiefs and councillors of greece
nestor the first the king idomeneus
the two ajaces next and tydeus son
ulysses sixth as jove in council sage
but uninvited menelaus came
knowing what cares upon his brother pressd
around the ox they stood and on his head
the salt cake sprinkled then amid them all
the monarch agamemnon prayd aloud
most great most glorious jove who dwellst on high
in clouds and darkness veild grant thou that ere
this sun shall set and night oerspread the earth
i may the haughty walls of priams house
lay prostrate in the dust and burn with fire
his lofty gates and strip from hectors breast
his swordrent tunic while around his corpse
many brave comrades prostrate bite the dust

thus he but saturns son his prayr denied
receivd his offrings but his toils increasd
their prayrs concluded and the salt cake strewed
upon the victims head they drew him back
and slew and flayd then cutting from the thighs
the choicest pieces and in double layers
oerspreading them with fat above them placd
the due meatoffrings these they burnt with logs
of leafless timber and the inward parts
first to be tasted oer the fire they held
the thighs consumd with fire the inward parts
they tasted first the rest upon the spits
roasted with care and from the fire withdrew
their labours ended and the feast prepard
they shared the social meal nor lacked there aught
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
gerenian nestor thus his speech began
most mighty agamemnon king of men
great atreus son no longer let us pause
the work delaying which the powrs of heavn
have trusted to our hands do thou forthwith
bid that the heralds proclamation make
and summon through the camp the brassclad greeks
while in a body through the widespread ranks
we pass and stimulate their warlike zeal

he said and agamemnon king of men
obedient to his counsel gave command
that to the war the clearvoicd heralds call
the longhaird greeks they gave the word and straight
from evry quarter throngd the eager crowd
the heavnborn kings encircling atreus son
the troops inspected pallas blueeyd maid
before the chiefs her glorious aegis bore
by time untouchd immortal all around
a hundred tassels hung rare works of art
all gold each one a hundred oxens price
with this the goddess passd along the ranks
exciting all and fixd in every breast
the firm resolve to wage unwearied war
and dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home
or wishd return became the battlefield

as when a wasting fire on mountain tops
hath seized the blazing woods afar is seen
the glaring light so as they movd to heavn
flashd the bright glitter of their burnishd arms

as when a numrous flock of birds or geese
or cranes or longneckd swans on asian mead
beside caysters stream now here now there
disporting ply their wings then settle down
with clamrous noise that all the mead resounds
so to scamanders plain from tents and ships
pourd forth the countless tribes the firm earth groand
beneath the tramp of steeds and armed men
upon scamanders flowry mead they stood
unnumberd as the vernal leaves and flowrs

or as the multitudinous swarms of flies
that round the cattlesheds in springtide pour
while the warm milk is frothing in the pail
so numberless upon the plain arrayd
for troys destruction stood the longhaird greeks
and as experienced goatherds when their flocks
are mingled in the pasture portion out
their sevral charges so the chiefs arrayd
their squadrons for the fight while in the midst
the mighty monarch agamemnon movd
his eye and lofty brow the counterpart
of jove the lord of thunder in his girth
another mars with neptunes ample chest
as mid the thronging heifers in a herd
stands proudly eminent the lordly bull
so by joves will stood eminent that day
mid many heroes atreus godlike son

say now ye nine who on olympus dwell

assuming of polites priams son
the trojan scout who trusting to his speed
was posted on the summit of the mound
of ancient æsuetes there to watch
till from their ships the grecian troops should march
his voice assuming thus the goddess spoke
old man as erst in peace so still thou lovst
the strife of words but fearful war is nigh
full many a host in line of battle rangd
my eyes have seen but such a force as this
so mighty and so vast i neer beheld
in number as the leaves or as the sand
against the city oer the plain they come
then hector for to thee i chiefly speak
this do thou knowst how various our allies
of diffrent nations and discordant tongues
let each then those command oer whom he reigns
and his own countrymen in arms array
she said and hector knew the voice divine
and all dissolvd the council flew to arms

slain by the son of peleus in the stream
and all his wealth achilles bore away

sarpedon last and valiant glaucus led
the lycian bands from distant lycias shore
beside the banks of xanthus eddying stream




when by their sevral chiefs the troops were rangd
with noise and clamour as a flight of birds
the men of troy advancd as when the cranes
flying the wintry storms send forth on high
their dissonant clamours while oer the ocean stream
they steer their course and on their pinions bear
battle and death to the pygmaean race

on th other side the greeks in silence movd
breathing firm courage bent on mutual aid
as when the south wind oer the mountain tops
spreads a thick veil of mist the shepherds bane
and friendly to the nightly thief alone
that a stones throw the range of vision bounds
so rose the dustcloud as in serried ranks
with rapid step they movd across the plain
but when th opposing forces near were met
a panthers skin across his shoulders flung
armd with his bow and sword in front of all
advancd the godlike paris in his hand
he poisd two brasstippd javlins and defied
to mortal combat all the chiefs of greece

him when the warlike menelaus saw
with haughty strides advancing from the crowd
as when a lion hungerpinchd espies
some mighty beast of chase or antlerd stag
or mountain goat and with exulting spring
strikes down his prey and on the carcase feeds
unscard by baying hounds and eager youths
so menelaus saw with fierce delight
the godlike paris for he deemd that now
his vengeance was at hand and from his car
armd as he was he leapd upon the plain
but when the godlike paris saw him spring
defiant from the ranks with quailing heart
back to his comrades sheltring crowd he sprang
in fear of death as when some travller spies
coild in his path upon the mountain side
a deadly snake back he recoils in haste
his limbs all trembling and his cheek all pale
so back recoild in fear of atreus son
the godlike paris mid the trojan host

to whom in stern rebuke thus hector spoke
thou wretched paris though in form so fair
thou slave of woman manhoods counterfeit
would thou hadst neer been born or died at least
unwedded so twere better far for all
than thus to live a scandal and reproach
well may the longhaird greeks triumphant boast
who think thee from thine outward show a chief
among our warriors but thou hast in truth
nor strength of mind nor courage in the fight
how wast that such as thou could eer induce
a noble band in oceangoing ships
to cross the main with men of other lands
mixing in amity and bearing thence
a woman fair of face by marriage ties
bound to a race of warriors to thy sire
thy state thy people cause of endless grief
of triumph to thy foes contempt to thee
durst thou the warlike menelaus meet
thou to thy cost shouldst learn the might of him
whose bride thou didst not fear to bear away
then shouldst thou find of small avail thy lyre
or venus gifts of beauty and of grace
or trampled in the dust thy flowing hair
but too forbearing are the men of troy
else for the ills that thou hast wrought the state
ere now thy body had in stone been casd

to whom the godlike paris thus replied
hector i needs must own thy censure just
nor without cause thy dauntless courage knows
nor pause nor weariness but as an axe
that in a strong mans hand who fashions out
some naval timber with unbated edge
cleaves the firm wood and aids the strikers force
evn so unwearied is thy warlike soul
yet blame not me for golden venus gifts
the gifts of heavn are not to be despisd
which heavn may give but man could not command
but if thou wilt that i should dare the fight
bid that the trojans and the grecians all
be seated on the ground and in the midst
the warlike menelaus and myself
stand front to front for helen and the spoils
of war to combat and whoeer shall prove
the better man in conflict let him bear
the woman and the spoils in triumph home
while ye the rest in peace and friendship sworn
shall still possess the fertile plains of troy
and to their native argos they return
for noble steeds and lovely women famd

he said and hector joyd to hear his words
forth in the midst he steppd and with his spear
graspd by the middle stayd the trojan ranks
at him the longhaired grecians bent their bows
prompt to assail with arrows and with stones
but loud the monarch agamemnons voice
was heard hold argives hold ye sons of greece
shoot not for hector of the glancing helm
hath as it seems some message to impart

he said they held their hands and silent stood
expectant till to both thus hector spoke
hear now ye trojans and ye wellgreavd greeks
the words of paris cause of all this war
he asks through me that all the host of troy
and grecian warriors shall upon the ground
lay down their glittring arms while in the midst
the warlike menelaus and himself
stand front to front for helen and the spoils
of war to combat and whoeer shall prove
the better man in conflict let him bear
the woman and the spoils in triumph home
while we the rest firm peace and friendship swear

thus hector spoke the rest in silence heard
but menelaus bold in fight replied
hear now my answer in this quarrel i
may claim the chiefest share and now i hope
trojans and greeks may see the final close
of all the labours ye so long have borne
t avenge my wrong at paris hand sustaind
and of us two whicheer is doomd to death
so let him die the rest depart in peace
bring then two lambs one white the other black
for tellus and for sol we on our part
will bring another for saturnian jove
and let the majesty of priam too
appear himself to consecrate our oaths

that none joves oath may dare to violate
for young mens spirits are too quickly stirrd
but in the councils checkd by revrend age
alike are weighd the future and the past
and for all intrests due provision made

he said and greeks and trojans gladly heard
in hopes of respite from the weary war
they rangd the cars in ranks and they themselves
descending doffd their arms and laid them down
close each by each with narrow space between
two heralds to the city hector sent
to bring the lambs and aged priam call
while agamemnon to the hollow ships
their lamb to bring in haste talthybius sent
he heard and straight the monarchs voice obeyd

meantime to whitearmd helen iris sped
the heavnly messenger in form she seemd
her husbands sister whom antenors son
the valiant helicaon had to wife
laodice of priams daughters all
loveliest of face she in her chamber found
her whom she sought a mighty web she wove
of double woof and brilliant hues whereon
was interwoven many a toilsome strife
of trojan warriors and of brassclad greeks
for her encounterd at the hand of mars
beside her iris stood and thus she spoke
come sister dear and see the glorious deeds
of trojan warriors and of brassclad greeks
they who erewhile impatient for the fight
rolld oer the plain the woful tide of war
now silent sit the storm of battle hushd
reclining on their shields their lances bright
beside them reared while paris in the midst
and warlike menelaus stand prepard
with the long spear for thee to fight thyself
the prize of conquest and the victors wife

thus as she spoke in helens breast arose
fond recollection of her former lord
her home and parents oer her head she threw
a snowy veil and shedding tender tears
she issud forth not unaccompanied
for with her went fair æthra pittheus child
and stageyd clymene her maidens twain
they quickly at the scaean gate arrivd

attending there on aged priam sat
the elders of the city panthous
and lampus and thymaetes clytius
bold icetaon and ucalegon
with sage antenor wise in council both
all these were gatherd at the scaean gate
by age exempt from war but in discourse
abundant as the cricket that on high
from topmost boughs of forest tree sends forth
his delicate music so on iliums towrs
sat the sage chiefs and councillors of troy
helen they saw as to the towr she came
and tis no marvel one to other said
the valiant trojans and the wellgreavd greeks
for beauty such as this should long endure
the toils of war for goddesslike she seems
and yet despite her beauty let her go
nor bring on us and on our sons a curse

thus they but aged priam helen calld
come here my child and sitting by my side
from whence thou canst discern thy former lord
his kindred and thy friends 
tell me the name of yonder mighty chief
among the greeks a warrior brave and strong
others in height surpass him but my eyes
a form so noble never yet beheld
nor so august he moves a king indeed

to whom in answer helen heavnly fair
with revrence dearest father and with shame
i look on thee oh would that i had died
that day when hither with thy son i came
and left my husband friends and darling child
and all the lovd companions of my youth
that i died not with grief i pine away
but to thy question i will tell thee true
yon chief is agamemnon atreus son
widereigning mighty monarch ruler good
and valiant warrior in my husbands name
lost as i am i calld him brother once

she spoke th old man admiring gazd and cried
oh blessd atrides child of happy fate
favourd of heavn how many noble greeks
obey thy rule in vineclad phrygia once
i saw the hosts of phrygian warriors wheel
their rapid steeds and with them all the bands
of otreus and of mygdon godlike king
who lay encampd beside sangarius stream
i too with them was numberd in the day
when met them in the field the amazons
the womanwarriors but their forces all
reachd not the number of the keeneyd greeks

ulysses next the old man saw and askd
tell me again dear child who this may be
in stature less than atreus royal son
but broadershoulderd and of ampler chest
his arms are laid upon the fertile plain
but he himself is moving through the ranks
inspecting like a fullfleecd ram that moves
majestic through a flock of snowwhite ewes

to whom joves offspring helen thus replied
the wise ulysses that laertes son
though bred in rugged ithaca yet versd
in evry stratagem and deep device
o woman then the sage antenor said
of these thy words i can the truth avouch
for hither when on thine account to treat
brave menelaus and ulysses came
i lodgd them in my house and lovd them both
and studied well the form and mind of each
as they with trojans mixd in social guise
when both were standing oer his comrade high
with broadset shoulders menelaus stood
seated ulysses was the nobler form
then in the great assembly when to all
their public speech and argument they framd
in fluent language menelaus spoke
in words though few yet clear though young in years
no wordy babbler wasteful of his speech
but when the skilld ulysses rose to speak
with downcast visage would he stand his eyes
bent on the ground the staff he bore nor back
he wavd nor forward but like one untaught
he held it motionless who only saw
would say that he was mad or void of sense
but when his chest its deeptond voice sent forth
with words that fell like flakes of wintry snow
no mortal with ulysses could compare
then little reckd we of his outward show

at sight of ajax next th old man enquird
who is yon other warrior brave and strong
towring oer all with head and shoulders broad

to whom in answer helen heavnly fair
gigantic ajax that the prop of greece
and by his side idomeneus of crete
stands godlike circled round by cretan chiefs
the warlike menelaus welcomd him
oft in our palace when from crete he came
now all the other keeneyd greeks i see
whom once i knew and now could call by name
but two i miss two captains of the host
my own two brethren and my mothers sons
castor and pollux castor charioteer
unrivalled pollux matchless pugilist
in lacedaemon have they stayd behind
or can it be in oceangoing ships
that they have come indeed but shun to join
the fight of warriors fearful of the shame
and deep disgrace that on my name attend
thus she but they beneath the teeming earth
in lacedaemon lay their native land

meanwhile the heralds through the city bore
the treaty offrings to the gods the lambs
and genial wine the produce of the soil
in goatskin flasks therewith a flagon bright
and cups of gold idaeus brought and stood
beside the aged king as thus he spoke
son of laomedon arise the chiefs
of trojan warriors and of brassclad greeks
call for thy presence on the battleplain
to swear a truce where paris in the midst
and warlike menelaus stand prepard
with the long spear for helen and the spoils
of war to combat that whoeer may prove
the better man in fight may bear away
the woman and the spoils in triumph home
while we the rest in peace and friendship sworn
shall still possess the fertile plains of troy
and to their native argos they return
for noble steeds and lovely women famd

he said the old man shuddered at his words
but to his comrades gave command forthwith
to yoke his car and they his word obeyd
priam ascending gatherd up the reins
and with antenor by his side the twain
drove through the scaean gate their flying steeds

but when between th opposing ranks they came
alighting from the car they movd on foot
between the trojan and the grecian hosts
uprose then agamemnon king of men
uprose the sage ulysses to the front
the heralds brought the offrings to the gods
and in the flagon mixd the wine and pourd
the hallowing water on the monarchs hands
his dagger then the son of atreus drew
suspended as was wont beside the hilt
of his great sword and from the victims head
he cut the sacred lock which to the chiefs
of troy and greece the heralds portiond out
then with uplifted hands he prayd aloud
o father jove who rulst from idas height
most great most glorious and thou sun who seest
and hearest all things rivers and thou earth
and ye who after death beneath the earth
your vengeance wreak on souls of men forsworn
be witness ye and this our covnant guard
if menelaus fall by paris hand
let him retain both helen and the spoil
while in our ships we take our homeward way
if paris be by menelaus slain
troy shall surrender helen and the spoil
with compensation due to greece that so
a record may to future days remain
but paris slain if priam and his sons
the promisd compensation shall withhold
then here my rights in battle to assert
will i remain till i the end achieve

thus as he spoke across the victims throats
he drew the pitiless blade and on the ground
he laid them gasping as the stream of life
pourd forth their vigour by the blade subdued
then from the flagon drawn from out the cups
the wine they pourd and to th eternal gods
they prayd and thus from trojans and from greeks
arose the joint petition grant o jove
most great most glorious grant ye heavnly powrs
that whosoeer this solemn truce shall break
evn as this wine we pour their hearts best blood
theirs and their childrens on the earth be pourd
and strangers in subjection take their wives

thus they but jove unyielding heard their prayr
the rites performd then aged priam spoke
hear me ye trojans and ye wellgreavd greeks
to iliums breezy heights i now withdraw
for that mine eyes will not endure the sight
of warlike menelaus and my son
engagd in deadly combat of the two
which may be doomd to death is only known
to jove and to th immortal powrs of heavn

thus spoke the godlike king and on the car
he placd the consecrated lambs himself
ascending then he gatherd up the reins
and with antenor by his side the twain
to iliums walls retracd their homeward way

then hector son of priam measurd out
with sage ulysses joind th allotted space
next in the brassbound helmet cast the lots
which of the two the first should throw the spear
the crowd with hands uplifted to the gods
trojans and greeks alike addressd their prayr
o father jove who rulst from idas height
most great most glorious grant that whosoeer
on both our armies hath this turmoil brought
may undergo the doom of death and we
the rest firm peace and lasting friendship swear

thus they great hector of the glancing helm
with eyes averted shook the casque and forth
was cast the lot of paris on the ground
the rest lay down by ranks where near to each
were rangd his active steeds and glittring arms
then oer his shoulders fairhaird helens lord
the godlike paris donnd his armour bright
first on his legs the wellwrought greaves he fixd
fastend with silver clasps his ample chest
a breastplate guarded by lycaon lent
his brother but which fitted well his form
around his shoulders slung his sword he bore
brassbladed silverstudded then his shield
weighty and strong and on his firmset head
a helm he wore well wrought with horsehair plume
that nodded fearful oer his brow his hand
graspd the firm spear familiar to his hold
prepard alike the adverse warrior stood

they from the crowd apart their armour donnd
came forth and each with eyes of mutual hate
regarded each admiring wonder seizd
the trojan warriors and the wellgreavd greeks
as in the centre of the measurd ground
they stood opposd and poisd their quivring spears
first paris threw his weighty spear and struck
fair in the midst atrides buckler round
but broke not through upon the stubborn targe
was bent the lances point then thus to jove
his weapon hurling menelaus prayd
great king on him who wrought me causeless wrong
on paris grant that retribution due
my arm may bring that men in days to come
may fear their host to injure and repay
with treachrous wile his hospitable cares

he said and poising hurld his weighty spear
full in the midst it struck the buckler round
right through the buckler passd the sturdy spear
and through the gorgeous breastplate and within
cut through the linen vest but paris back
inclining stoopd and shunnd the doom of death

atrides then his silverstudded sword
rearing on high a mighty blow let fall
on paris helm but shivring in his hand
in countless fragments new the faithless blade
then thus to jove with eyes uplift to heavn
atrides made his moan o father jove
of all the gods the most unfriendly thou
on paris head i hopd for all his crimes
to wreak my vengeance due but in my grasp
my faithless sword is shatterd and my spear
hath bootless left my hand nor reached my foe
then onward rushing by the horsehair plume
he seizd his foemans helm and wrenching round
draggd by main force amid the wellgreavd greeks
the broiderd strap that passd beneath his beard
the helmet held the warriors throat compressd
then had atrides draggd him from the field
and endless fame acquird but venus child
of jove her favrites peril quickly saw
and broke the throttling strap of tough bulls hide
in the broad hand the empty helm remained
the trophy by their champion whirld amid
the wellgreavd greeks his eager comrades seizd
while he infuriate rushd with murdrous aim
on priams son but him the queen of love
 from the field conveyd
wrapt in a misty cloud and on a couch
sweet perfumes breathing gently laid him down
then went in search of helen her she found
circled with trojan dames on iliums towr
her by her airy robe the goddess held
and in the likeness of an aged dame
who oft for her in sparta when she dwelt
many a fair fleece had wrought and lovd her well
addressd her thus come helen to thy house
come paris calls thee in his chamber he
expects thee resting on luxurious couch
in costly garb with manly beauty gracd
not from the fight of warriors wouldst thou deem
he late had come but for the dance prepard
or resting from the dances pleasing toil

she said and helens spirit within her movd
and when she saw the goddess beauteous neck
her lovely bosom and her glowing eyes
she gazd in wonder and addressd her thus
oh why great goddess make me thus thy sport
seekst thou to bear me far away from hence
to some fair phrygian or maeonian town
if there some mortal have thy favour gaind
or for that menelaus in the field
hath vanquishd paris and is willing yet
that i his bane should to his home return
here art thou found to weave again thy wiles
go then thyself thy godship abdicate
renounce olympus lavish here on him
thy pity and thy care he may perchance
make thee his wifeat least his paramour
but thither go not i foul shame it were
again to share his bed the dames of troy
will for a byword hold me and een now
my soul with endless sorrow is possessd

to whom in anger heavnly venus spoke
incense me not poor fool lest i in wrath
desert thee quite and as i heretofore
have lovd so make thee object of my hate
and kindle twixt the trojans and the greeks
such bitter feuds as both shall wreak on thee

she said and trembled helen child of jove
she rose in silence in a snowwhite veil
all glittring shrouded by the goddess led
she passd unnoticd by the trojan dames
but when to paris splendid house they came
thronging around her her attendants gave
their duteous service through the lofty hall
with queenly grace the godlike woman passd
a seat the laughterloving goddess placd
by paris side there helen sat the child
of aegisbearing jove with downcast eyes
yet with sharp words she thus addressd her lord
back from the battle would thou there hadst died
beneath a warriors arm whom once i calld
my husband vainly didst thou boast erewhile
thine arm thy dauntless courage and thy spear
the warlike menelaus should subdue
go now again and challenge to the fight
the warlike menelaus be thou ware
i warn thee pause ere madly thou presume
with fairhaird menelaus to contend
soon shouldst thou fall beneath his conquring spear

to whom thus paris wring not thus my soul
with keen reproaches now with pallas aid
hath menelaus conquerd but my day
will come i too can boast my guardian gods
but turn we now to love and loves delights
for never did thy beauty so inflame
my sense not when from lacedaemon first
i bore thee in my oceangoing ships
and revelld in thy love on cranaes isle
as now it fills my soul with fond desire

he said and led her to the nuptial couch
her lord she followd and while there reclind
upon the richlyinlaid couch they lay
atrides like a lion baffled rushd
amid the crowd if haply he might find
the godlike paris but not one of all
the trojans and their brave allies could aid
the warlike menelaus in his search
not that for love would any one that knew
have screend him from his anger for they all
abhorrd him as the shade of death then thus
outspoke great agamemnon king of men
hear me ye trojans dardans and allies
with warlike menelaus rests tis plain
the prize of victry then surrender ye
the argive helen and the spoils of war
with compensation due to greece that so
a record may to future days remain

thus he the greeks assenting cheerd his words





on golden pavement round the board of jove
the gods were gatherd hebe in the midst
pourd the sweet nectar they in golden cups
each other pledgd as down they lookd on troy
then jove with cutting words and taunting tone
began the wrath of juno to provoke
two goddesses for menelaus fight
thou juno queen of argos and with thee
minerva shield of warriors but ye two
sitting aloof wellpleased it seems look on
while laughterloving venus at the side
of paris standing still averts his fate
and rescues when as now expecting death
to warlike menelaus we decree
of right the victry but consult we now
what may the issue be if we shall light
again the name of war and discord fierce
or the two sides in peace and friendship join
for me if thus your genral voice incline
let priams city stand and helen back
to warlike menelaus be restord

so spoke the god but seated side by side
juno and pallas glances interchangd
of ill portent for troy pallas indeed
sat silent and though inly wroth with jove
yet answerd not a word but junos breast
could not contain her rage and thus she spoke
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
how wouldst thou render vain and void of fruit
my weary labour and my horses toil
to stir the people and on priams self
and priams offspring bring disastrous fate
do as thou wilt yet not with our consent

to whom in wrath the cloudcompeller thus
revengeful how have priam and his sons
so deeply injurd thee that thus thou seekst
with unabated anger to pursue
till thou oerthrow the strongbuilt walls of troy
couldst thou but force the gates and entering in
on priams mangled flesh and priams sons
and trojans all a bloody banquet make
perchance thy fury might at length be stayed
but have thy will lest this in future times
twixt me and thee be cause of strife renewd
yet hear my words and ponder what i say
if eer in times to come my will should be
some city to destroy inhabited
by men beloved of thee seek not to turn
my wrath aside but yield as i do now
consenting but with heart that ill consents
for of all cities fair beneath the sun
and starry heaven the abode of mortal men
none to my soul was dear as sacred troy
and priams self and priams warrior race
for with drinkoffrings due and fat of lambs
my altar still hath at their hands been fed
such honour hath to us been ever paid

to whom the stageyd juno thus replied
three cities are there dearest to my heart
argos and sparta and the ample streets
of rich mycenæ work on them thy will
destroy them if thine anger they incur
i will not interpose nor hinder thee
mourn them i shall reluctant see their fall
but not resist for sovereign is thy will
yet should my labours not be fruitless all
for i too am a god my blood is thine
worthy of honour as the eldest born
of deepdesigning saturn and thy wife
thine who oer all th immortals reignst supreme
but yield we each to other i to thee
and thou to me the other gods will all
by us be ruld on pallas then enjoin
that to the battlefield of greece and troy
she haste and so contrive that trojans first
may break the treaty and the greeks assail

she said the sire of gods and men complied
and thus with winged words to pallas spoke
go to the battlefield of greece and troy
in haste and so contrive that trojans first
may break the treaty and the greeks assail

his words fresh impulse gave to pallas zeal
and from olympus heights in haste she sped
like to a meteor that of grave portent
to warring armies or seafaring men
the son of deepdesigning saturn sends
brightflashing scattring fiery sparks around
the blueeyd goddess darted down to earth
and lighted in the midst amazement held
the trojan warriors and the wellgreavd greeks
and one to other lookd and said what means
this sign must fearful battle rage again
or may we hope for gentle peace from jove
who to mankind dispenses peace and war
such was the converse greeks and trojans held
pallas meanwhile amid the trojan host
clad in the likeness of antenors son
laodocus a spearman stout and brave
searchd here and there if haply she might find
the godlike pandarus lycaons son
she found of noble birth and stalwart form
standing encircled by his sturdy band
of bucklered followers from æsepus stream
she stood beside him and addressd him thus

wilt thou by me be ruled lycaons son
for durst thou but at menelaus shoot
thy winged arrow great would be thy fame
and great thy favour with the men of troy
and most of all with paris at his hand
thou shalt receive rich guerdon when he hears
that warlike menelaus by thy shaft
subdued is laid upon the funral pyre
bend then thy bow at atreus glorious son
vowing to phoebus lycias guardian god
the archerking to pay of firstling lambs
an ample hecatomb when home returnd
in safety to zeleias sacred town
thus she and fool he listend to her words
straight he uncasd his polishd bow his spoil
won from a mountain ibex which himself
in ambush lurking through the breast had shot
true to his aim as from behind a crag
he came in sight prone on the rock he fell
with horns of sixteen palms his head was crownd
these deftly wrought a skilful workmans hand
and polishd smooth and tippd the ends with gold
he bent and resting on the ground his bow
strung it anew his faithful comrades held
their shields before him lest the sons of greece
should make their onset ere his shaft could reach
the warlike menelaus atreus son
his quiver then withdrawing from its case
with care a shaft he chose neer shot before
wellfeatherd messenger of pangs and death
the stinging arrow fitted to the string
and vowd to phoebus lycias guardian god
the archerking to pay of firstling lambs
an ample hecatomb when home returnd
in safety to zeleias sacred town
at once the sinew and the notch he drew
the sinew to his breast and to the bow
the iron head then when the mighty bow
was to a circle straind sharp rang the horn
and loud the sinew twangd as towrd the crowd
with deadly speed the eager arrow sprang

nor menelaus was thy safety then
uncard for of the gods joves daughter first
pallas before thee stood and turnd aside
the pointed arrow turnd it so aside
as when a mother from her infants cheek
wrapt in sweet slumbers brushes off a fly
its course she so directed that it struck
just where the golden clasps the belt restraind
and where the breastplate doubled checkd its force
on the closefitting belt the arrow struck
right through the belt of curious workmanship
it drove and through the breastplate richly wrought
and through the coat of mail he wore beneath
his inmost guard and best defence to check
the hostile weapons force yet onward still
the arrow drove and grazd the heros flesh
forth issued from the wound the crimson blood
as when some carian or maeonian maid
with crimson dye the ivory stains designed
to be the cheekpiece of a warriors steed
by many a valiant horseman coveted
as in the house it lies a monarchs boast
the horse adorning and the horsemans pride
so menelaus then thy graceful thighs
and knees and ancles with thy blood were dyd

great agamemnon shudderd as he saw
the crimson drops outwelling from the wound
shudderd the warlike menelaus self
but when not buried in his flesh he saw
the barb and sinew back his spirit came

then deeply groaning agamemnon spoke
as menelaus by the hand he held
and with him groand his comrades brother dear
i wrought thy death when late on compact sworn
i sent thee forth alone for greece to fight
wounded by trojans who their plighted faith
have trodden under foot but not in vain
are solemn covnants and the blood of lambs
the treaty wine outpoured and handplight given
wherein men place their trust if not at once
yet soon or late will jove assert their claim
and heavy penalties the perjured pay
with their own blood their childrens and their wives
so in my inmost soul full well i know
the day shall come when this imperial troy
and priams race and priams royal self
shall in one common ruin be oerthrown
and saturns son himself highthroned jove
who dwells in heavn shall in their faces flash
his aegis dark and dread this treachrous deed
avenging this shall surely come to pass
but menelaus deep will be my grief
if thou shouldst perish meeting thus thy fate
to thirsty argos should i then return
by foul disgrace oerwhelmd for with thy fall
the greeks will mind them of their native land
and as a trophy to the sons of troy
the argive helen leave thy bones meanwhile
shall moulder here beneath a foreign soil
thy work undone and with insulting scorn
some vaunting trojan leaping on the tomb
of noble menelaus thus shall say
on all his foes may agamemnon so
his wrath accomplish who hath hither led
of greeks a mighty army all in vain
and bootless home with empty ships hath gone
and valiant menelaus left behind
thus when men speak gape earth and hide my shame

to whom the fairhaird menelaus thus
with cheering words fear not thyself nor cause
the troops to fear the arrow hath not touchd
a vital part the sparkling belt hath first
turnd it aside the doublet next beneath
and coat of mail the work of armrers hands

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
dear menelaus may thy words be true
the leech shall tend thy wound and spread it oer
with healing ointments to assuage the pain

he said and to the sacred herald calld
haste thee talthybius summon with all speed
the son of æsculapius peerless leech
machaon bid him hither haste to see
the warlike menelaus chief of greeks
who by an arrow from some practisd hand
trojan or lycian hath receivd a wound
a cause of boast to them to us of grief

he said nor did the herald not obey
but through the brassclad ranks of greece he passd
in search of brave machaon him he found
standing by bucklerd warriors bold begirt
who followd him from tricas grassy plains
he stood beside him and addressd him thus
up son of æsculapius atreus son
the mighty monarch summons thee to see
the warlike menelaus chief of greeks
who by an arrow from some practisd hand
trojan or lycian hath receivd a wound
a cause of boast to them to us of grief

thus he and not unmovd machaon heard
they thro the crowd and thro the widespread host
together took their way but when they came
where fairhaird menelaus wounded stood
around him in a ring the best of greece
and in the midst the godlike chief himself
from the closefitting belt the shaft he drew
breaking the pointed barbs the sparkling belt
he loosend and the doublet underneath
and coat of mail the work of armrers hand
but when the wound appeard in sight where struck
the stinging arrow from the clotted blood
he cleansd it and applied with skilful hand
the herbs of healing power which chiron erst
in friendly guise upon his sire bestowed

while round the valiant menelaus they
were thus engagd advancd the trojan hosts
they donnd their arms and for the fight prepard
in agamemnon then no trace was seen
of laggard sloth no shrinking from the fight
but full of ardour to the field he rushd
he left his horses and brassmounted car
 but with repeated charge
still to be near at hand when faint with toil
his limbs should fail him marshalling his host
himself on foot the warrior ranks arrayd
with cheering words addressing whom he found
with zeal preparing for the battlefield
relax not valiant friends your warlike toil
for jove to falsehood neer will give his aid
and they who first regardless of their oaths
have broken truce shall with their flesh themselves
the vultures feed while we their city razd
their wives and helpless children bear away

but whom remiss and shrinking from the war
he found with keen rebuke he thus assaild
ye wretched greeks your countrys foul reproach
have ye no sense of shame why stand ye thus
like timid fawns that in the chase run down
stand all bewildered spiritless and tame
so stand ye now nor dare to face the fight
what will ye wait the trojans near approach
where on the beach beside the hoary deep
our goodly ships are drawn and see if jove
will oer you his protecting hand extend

as thus the king the serried ranks reviewd
he came where thronging round their skilful chief
idomeneus the warlike bands of crete
were arming for the fight idomeneus
of courage stubborn as the forest boar
the foremost ranks arrayd meriones
the rearmost squadrons had in charge with joy
the monarch agamemnon saw and thus
with accents bland idomeneus addressd

idomeneus above all other greeks
in battle and elsewhere i honour thee
and in the banquet where the noblest mix
the ruddy wine for chiefs alone reserved
though others drink their share yet by thy side
thy cup like mine still new replenished stands
to drink at pleasure up then to the fight
and show thyself the warrior that thou art

to whom the cretan king idomeneus
in me atrides thou shalt ever find
as at the first i promisd comrade true
but go and stir the other longhaired greeks
to speedy battle since the trojans now
the truce have broken and defeat and death
must wait on those who have their oaths forsworn

he said and agamemnon went his way
rejoicing through the crowd he passd and came
where stood th ajaces them in act to arm
amid a cloud of infantry he found
and as a goatherd from his watchtowr crag
beholds a cloud advancing oer the sea
by zephyrs breath impelld as from afar
he gazes black as pitch it sweeps along
oer the dark oceans face and with it brings
a hurricane of rain he shuddring sees
and drives his flock beneath the sheltring cave
so thick and dark about th ajaces stirrd
impatient for the war the stalwart youths
black masses bristling close with spear and shield

well pleasd the monarch agamemnon saw
and thus addressd them valiant chiefs to you
the leaders of the brassclad greeks i give
 no commands
for well ye understand your troops to rouse
to deeds of dauntless courage would to jove
to pallas and apollo that such mind
as is in you in all the camp were found
then soon should priams lofty city fall
takn and destroyd by our victorious hands

thus saying them he left and onward movd
nestor the smoothtongud pylian chief he found
the troops arraying and to valiant deeds
his friends encouraging stout pelagon
alastor chromius haemon warlike prince
and bias bold his peoples sure defence
in the front rank with chariot and with horse
he placd the carborne warriors in the rear
numrous and brave a cloud of infantry
compactly massd to stem the tide of war
between the two he placd th inferior troops
that een against their will they needs must fight
the horsemen first he chargd and bade them keep
their horses well in hand nor wildly rush
amid the tumult see he said that none
in skill or valour overconfident
advance before his comrades nor alone
retire for so your lines were easier forcd
but ranging each beside a hostile car
thrust with your spears for such the better way
by men so disciplind in elder days
were lofty walls and fenced towns destroyd

thus he experiencd in the wars of old
well pleasd the monarch agamemnon saw
and thus addressd him would to heavn old man
that as thy spirit such too were thy strength
and vigour of thy limbs but now old age
the common lot of mortals weighs thee down
would i could see some others in thy place
and thou couldst still be numbered with the young

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
atrides i too fain would see restord
the strength i once possessd what time i slew
the godlike ereuthalion but the gods
on man bestow not all their gifts at once
i then was young and now am bowd with age
yet with the chariots can i still go forth
and aid with sage advice for such the right
and privilege of age to hurl the spear
belongs to younger men who after me
were born who boast their vigour unimpaird

he said and agamemnon went his way
rejoicing to menestheus next he came
the son of peteus charioteer renownd
him found he circled by th athenian bands
the raisers of the warcry close beside
the sage ulysses stood around him rangd
not unrenownd the cephalonian troops
the sound of battle had not reachd their ears
for but of late the greek and trojan hosts
were set in motion they expecting stood
till other grecian columns should advance
assail the trojans and renew the war

atrides saw and thus reproachful spoke
o son of peteus heavndescended king
and thou too master of all tricky arts
why lingring stand ye thus aloof and wait
for others coming ye should be the first
the hot assault of battle to confront
for ye are first my summons to receive
wheneer the honourd banquet we prepare
and well ye like to eat the savry meat
and at your will the luscious winecups drain
now stand ye here and unconcernd would see
ten columns pass before you to the fight

to whom with stern regard ulysses thus
what words have passd the barrier of thy lips
atrides how with want of warlike zeal
canst thou reproach us when the greeks again
the furious war shall waken thou shalt see
 amid the ranks
of troy the father of telemachus
in the forefront thy words are empty wind

atrides saw him chafed and smiling thus
recalled his former words ulysses sage
laertes highborn son not overmuch
i give thee blame or orders for i know
thy mind to gentle counsels is inclind
thy thoughts are one with mine then come henceforth
shall all be well and if a hasty word
have passd may heaven regard it as unsaid

thus saying them he left and onward movd
the son of tydeus valiant diomed
standing he found amid his warlike steeds
and wellbuilt cars beside him sthenelus
the son of capaneus atrides saw
and thus addressd him with reproachful words
alas thou son of tydeus wise and bold
why crouch with fear why thus appalld survey
the pass of war not so had tydeus crouchd
his hand was ever ready from their foes
to guard his comrades so at least they say
whose eyes beheld his labours i myself
nor met him eer nor saw but by report
thy father was the foremost man of men
a stranger to mycenæ once he came
with godlike polynices not at war
but seeking succour for the troops that lay
encampd before the sacred walls of thebes
for reinforcements earnestly they sued
the boon they askd was granted them but jove
with unpropitious omens turnd them back
advancing on their journey when they reachd
asopus grassy banks and rushes deep
the greeks upon a mission tydeus sent
he went and many thebans there he found
feasting in eteocles royal hall
amid them all a stranger and alone
he stood unterrified and challengd all
to wrestle with him and with ease oerthrew
so mighty was the aid that pallas gave
whereat indignant they on his return
an ambush set of fifty chosen youths
two were their leaders haemons godlike son
maeon and lycophontes warrior brave
son of autophonus and these too fard
but ill at tydeus hand he slew them all
maeon alone obedient to the gods
he spard and bade him bear the tidings home
such tydeus was though greater in debate
his son will never rival him in arms

he said brave diomed in silence heard
submissive to the monarchs stern rebuke
then answerd thus the son of capaneus
atrides speak not falsely well thou knowst
the truth that we our fathers far surpass
the sevengated city thebes we took
with smaller force beneath the wall of mars
trusting to heavnly signs and favring jove
where they by blind presumptuous folly faild
then equal not our fathers deeds with ours

to whom thus diomed with stern regard
father be silent hearken to my words
i blame not agamemnon king of men
who thus to battle stirs the wellgreavd greeks
his will the glory be if we oercome
the valiant trojans and their city take
great too his loss if they oer us prevail
then come let us too for the fight prepare

he said and from the car leapd down in arms
fierce rang the armour on the warriors breast
that evn the stoutest heart might quail with fear

as by the west wind drivn the ocean waves
dash forward on the farresounding shore
wave upon wave first curls the ruffled sea
with whitning crests anon with thundring roar
it breaks upon the beach and from the crags
recoiling flings in giant curves its head
aloft and tosses high the wild seaspray
column on column so the hosts of greece
pourd ceaseless to the war to each the chiefs
their orders gave the rest in silence movd
nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued
with power of speech so silently they moved
in awe of their great captains far around
flashed the bright armour they were girt withal

on th other hand the trojans as the flocks
that in the courtyard of some wealthy lord
in countless numbers stand at milkingtime
incessant bleating as their lambs they hear
so rose their mingled clamours through the camp
for not one language nor one speech was there
but many nations calld from distant lands
these mars inspird and those the blueeyd maid
and fear and flight and discord unappeasd
of bloodstaind mars the sister and the friend
with humble crest at first anon her head
while yet she treads the earth affronts the skies
the gage of battle in the midst she threw
strode through the crowd and woe to mortals wrought
when to the midst they came together rushd
bucklers and lances and the furious might
of mailclad warriors bossy shield on shield
clatterd in conflict loud the clamour rose
then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
slaying and slain the earth ran red with blood
as when descending from the mountains brow
two wintry torrents from their copious source
pour downward to the narrow pass where meet
their mingled waters in some deep ravine
their weight of flood on the far mountains side
the shepherd hears the roar so loud arose
the shouts and yells of those commingling hosts

first mid the foremost ranks antilochus
a trojan warrior echepolus slew
a crested chief thalesius noble son
beneath his horsehairplumed helmets peak
the sharp spear struck deep in his forehead fixd
it piercd the bone then darkness veild his eyes
and like a towr amid the press he fell
him elephenor brave abantian chief
son of chalcodon seizing by the feet
draggd from beneath the darts in haste to strip
his armour off but shortlivd was th attempt
for bold agenor markd him as he drew
the corpse aside and with his brasstippd spear
thrust through his flank unguarded as he stoopd
beside his shield and slackd his limbs in death
the spirit was fled but hotly oer him ragd
the war of greeks and trojans fierce as wolves
they fought man struggling hand to hand with man

then ajax telamon a stalwart youth
son of anthemion simoisius slew
whose mother gave him birth on simois banks
when with her parents down from idas heights
she drove her flock thence simoisius namd
not destined he his parents to repay
their early care for short his term of life
by godlike ajax mighty spear subdued
him to the front advancing in the breast
by the right nipple ajax struck right through
from front to back the brasstippd spear was drivn
out through the shoulder prone in dust he fell
as some tall poplar grown in marshy mead
smoothstemmd with branches tapering towrd the head
which with the biting axe the wheelwright fells
to bend the felloes of his wellbuilt car
sapless beside the river lies the tree
so lay the youthful simoisius felled
by godlike ajax hand at him in turn
the son of priam antiphus encasd
in radiant armour from amid the crowd
his javlin threw his mark indeed he missd
but through the groin ulysses faithful friend
leucus he struck in act to bear away
the youthful dead down on the corpse he fell
and dying of the dead relaxd his grasp
fierce anger at his comrades slaughter filled
ulysses breast in burnished armour clad
forward he rushd and standing near around
he lookd and poisd on high his glittring lance
beneath his aim the trojans back recoild
nor vainly flew the spear democoon
a bastard son of priam met the blow
he from abydos came his highbred mares
there left to pasture him ulysses filld
with fury at his lovd companions death
smote on the head through either temple passd
the pointed spear and darkness veild his eyes
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang
at this the trojan chiefs and hectors self
gan to give ground the greeks with joyful shouts
seizd on the dead and forward urgd their course
from iliums heights apollo filled with wrath
lookd down and to the trojans shouted loud
uprouse ye valiant trojans give not way
before the greeks their bodies are not stone
nor iron to defy your trenchant swords
and great achilles fairhaird thetis son
fights not but oer his anger broods apart
so from the city calld the heavnly voice
the greeks meanwhile allglorious pallas fird
movd mid the tumult and the laggards rousd

then fell diores amarynceus son
a rugged fragment of a rock had crushd
his ancle and right leg from ænon came
the thracian chief who hurld it peirous son
of imbrasus the tendons both and bones
the huge mass shatterd backward in the dust
he fell both hands extending to his friends
gasping his life away then quick upran
he who the blow had dealt and with his spear
thrust through him by the navel from the wound
his bowels gushd and darkness veild his eyes

but he advancing through the breast was struck
above the nipple by th ætolian chief
thoas and through his lungs the spear was drivn
thoas approachd and from his breast withdrew
the sturdy spear and with his sharpedgd sword
across his waistband gave the mortal stroke
yet could not touch his arms for all around
the thracian warriors with their tufted crowns
their long spears held before them him though stout
and strong and valiant kept at bay perforce
he yielded and thus side by side were laid
the two the thracian and th epeian chief
and round them many a valiant soldier lay

well might the deeds achieved that day deserve
his praise who through that bloody field might pass
by sword or spear unwounded by the hand
of pallas guarded from the weapons flight
for many a trojan many a greek that day
prone in the dust and side by side were laid





such strength and courage then to diomed
the son of tydeus pallas gave as raisd
mid all the greeks the glory of his name
forth from his helm and shield a fiery light
there flashd like autumns star that brightest shines
when newly risen from his ocean bath
so from the warriors head and shoulders flashd
that fiery light as to the midst he urgd
his furious course where densest masses fought

there was one dares mid the trojan host
the priest of vulcan rich of blameless life
two gallant sons he had idaeus namd
and phegeus skilld in all the points of war
these parted from the throng the warrior met
they on their car while he on foot advancd
when near they came first phegeus threw his spear
oer the left shoulder of tydides passd
the erring weapons point and missd its mark
his pondrous spear in turn tydides threw
and not in vain on phegeus breast it struck
full in the midst and hurld him from the car
idaeus from the wellwrought chariot sprang
and fled nor durst his brothers corpse defend
nor had he so escapd the doom of death
but vulcan bore him safely from the field
in darkness shrouded that his aged sire
might not be wholly of his sons bereavd
the car tydides to his comrades gave
and bade them to the ships the horses drive

now when the trojans dares sons beheld
the one in flight the other stretchd in death
their spirits within them quaild but pallas took
the hand of mars and thus addressd the god
mars mars thou bane of mortals bloodstaind lord
razer of cities wherefore leave we not
the greeks and trojans to contend and see
to which the sire of all will victry give
while we retire and shun the wrath of jove

thus saying from the battle mars she led
and placd him on scamanders steepy banks

the greeks drove back the trojan host the chiefs
slew each his victim agamemnon first
the mighty monarch from his chariot hurld
hodius the sturdy halizonian chief
him as he turnd between the shoulderblades
the javlin struck and through his chest was drivn
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang

on phaestus borus son maeonian chief
who from the fertile plains of tarna came
then sprang idomeneus and as he sought
to mount upon his car the cretan king
through his right shoulder drove the pointed spear
he fell the shades of death his eyes oerspread
and of his arms the followers strippd his corpse

the son of atreus menelaus slew
scamandrius son of strophius sportsman keen
in woodcraft skilful for his practisd hand
had by dianas self been taught to slay
each beast of chase the mountain forest holds
but nought availd him then the archerqueen
dianas counsels nor his boasted art
of distant aim for as he fled the lance
of menelaus atreus warlike son
behind his neck between the shoulderblades
his flight arresting through his chest was drivn
headlong he fell and loud his armour rang

phereclus by meriones was slain
son of harmonides whose practisd hand
knew well to fashion many a work of art
by pallas highly favourd he the ships
for paris built first origin of ill
freighted with evil to the men of troy
and to himself who knew not heavns decrees
him in his headlong flight in hot pursuit
meriones oertook and thrust his lance
through his right flank beneath the bone was drivn
the spear and piercd him through prone on his knees
groaning he fell and death his eyelids closd

meges pedaeus slew antenors son
a bastard born but by theano reard
with tender care and nurturd as her son
with her own children for her husbands sake
him phyleus warrior son approaching near
thrust through the junction of the head and neck
crashd through his teeth the spear beneath the tongue
prone in the dust he gnashd the brazen point

eurypylus euaemons noble son
hypsenor slew the worthy progeny
of dolopion brave scamanders priest
and by the people as a god reverd
him as he fled before him from behind
eurypylus euaemons noble son
smote with the sword and from the shoulderpoint
the brawny arm he severd to the ground
down fell the gory hand the darkling shades
of death and rigrous doom his eyelids closd

thus labourd they amid the stubborn fight
but of tydides none might say to whom
his arm belongd or whether with the hosts
of troy or greece he mingled in the fight
hither and thither oer the plain he rushd
like to a wintry stream that brimming oer
breaks down its barriers in its rapid course
nor wellbuilt bridge can stem the flood nor fence
guards the fertile fields as down it pours
its sudden torrent swolln with rain from heavn
and many a goodly work of man destroys
so back were borne before tydides might
the serried ranks of troy nor dard await
despite their numbers his impetuous charge

him when lycaons noble son beheld
careering oer the plain the serried ranks
driving before him quick at tydeus son
he bent his bow and onward as he rushd
on the right shoulder near the breastplates joint
the stinging arrow struck right through it passd
and held its way that blood the breastplate staind
then shouted loud lycaons noble son
arouse ye valiant trojans ye who goad
your flying steeds the bravest of the greeks
is wounded nor i deem can long withstand
my weapon if indeed from lycias shore
by phoebus counsel sent i joind the war

thus he vainglorious but not so was quelld
the godlike chief back he withdrew and stood
beside his car and thus to sthenelus
the son of capaneus his speech addressd
up gentle son of capaneus descend
from off the car and from my shoulder draw
this stinging arrow forth he said and down
leapd from the chariot sthenelus and stood
beside him and as forth he drew the shaft
gushd out the blood and dyed the twisted mail
then thus the valiant son of tydeus prayd
hear me thou child of aegisbearing jove
unconquerd if amid the deadly fight
thy friendly aid my father eer sustaind
let me in turn thy favour find and grant
within my reach and compass of my spear
that man may find himself who unawares
hath wounded me and vainly boasting deems
i shall not long behold the light of day
thus prayd the chief and pallas heard his prayr
to all his limbs to feet and hands alike
she gave fresh vigour and with winged words
beside him as she stood addressd him thus

go fearless onward diomed to meet
the trojan hosts for i within thy breast
thy fathers dauntless courage have infusd
such as of old in tydeus bosom dwelt
bold horseman bucklerclad and from thine eyes
the film that dimmd them i have purgd away
that thou mayst well twixt gods and men discern
if then some god make trial of thy force
with other of th immortals fight thou not
but should joves daughter venus dare the fray
thou needst not shun at her to cast thy spear

this said the blueeyd goddess disappeard
forthwith again amid the foremost ranks
tydides mingled keenly as before
his spirit against the trojans burnd to fight
with threefold fury now he sought the fray
as when a hungry lion has oerleapd
the sheepfold him the guardian of the flock
has wounded not disabled by his wound
to rage excited but not forcd to fly
the fold he enters scares the trembling sheep
that closely huddled each on other press
then pounces on his prey and leaps the fence
so pouncd tydides on the trojan host
astynous and hypeiron then he slew
his peoples guardian through the breast of one
he drove his spear and with his mighty sword
he smote the other on the collarbone
the shoulder sevring from the neck and back
them left he there to lie of abas then
and polyeidus went in hot pursuit
sons of eurydamas an aged seer
whose visions stayd them not but both were doomd
a prey to valiant diomed to fall
xanthus and thoon then the hero slew
the sons of phaenops children of his age
he worn with years no other sons begot
heirs of his wealth they two together fell
and to their father left a load of grief
that from the battle they returnd not home
and distant kindred all his substance shard
on chromius and echemon next he fell
two sons of priam on one chariot borne
and as a lion springs upon a herd
and breaks the neck of heifer or of steer
feeding in woodland glade with such a spring
these two in vain resisting from their car
tydides hurld then strippd their arms and bade
his followers lead their horses to the ships

him when æneas saw amid the ranks
dealing destruction through the fight and throng
of spears he plungd if haply he might find
the godlike pandarus lycaons son
he found of noble birth and stalwart form
and stood before him and addressd him thus
where pandarus are now thy winged shafts
thy bow and wellknown skill wherein with thee
can no man here contend nor lycia boasts
through all her widespread plains a truer aim
then raise to jove thy hands and with thy shaft
strike down this chief whoeer he be that thus
is making fearful havoc in our host
relaxing many a warriors limbs in death
if he be not indeed a god incensd
against the trojans for neglected rites
for fearful is the vengeance of a god

whom answerd thus lycaons noble son
æneas chief and councillor of troy
most like in all respects to tydeus son
he seems his shield i know and visord helm
and horses whether he himself be god
i cannot tell but if he be indeed
the man i think him tydeus valiant son
he fights not thus without the aid of heavn
but by his side his shoulders veiled in cloud
some god attends his steps and turns away
the shaft that just hath reachd him for evn now
a shaft i shot which by the breastplates joint
piercd his right shoulder through full sure i deemd
that shaft had sent him to the shades and yet
it slew him not tis sure some angry god
nor horse have i nor car on which to mount
but in my sire lycaons wealthy house
elevn fair chariots stand all newly built
each with its cover by the side of each
two steeds on rye and barley white are fed
and in his wellbuilt house when here i came
lycaon aged warrior urgd me oft
with horses and with chariots high upborne
to lead the trojans in the stubborn fight
i hearkend nottwere better if i had
yet feard i lest my horses wont to feed
in plenty unstinted by the soldiers wants
might of their customd forage be deprivd
i left them there and hither came on foot
and trusting to my bow vain trust it seems
two chiefs already have i struck the sons
of tydeus and of atreus with true aim
drawn blood from both yet but increasd their rage
sad was the hour when down from where it hung
i took my bow and hasting to the aid
of godlike hector hither led my troops
but should i eer return and see again
my native land my wife my lofty hall
then may a strangers sword cut off my head
if with these hands i shatter not and burn
the bow that thus hath faild me at my need

him answerd thus æneas chief of troy
speak thou not thus our fortunes shall not change
till thou and i with chariot and with horse
this chief encounter and his prowess prove
then mount my car and see how swift my steeds
hither and thither in pursuit or flight
from those of tros descended scour the plain
so if the victory to diomed
the son of tydeus should by jove be givn
we yet may safely reach the walls of troy
take thou the whip and reins while i descend
to fight on foot or thou the chief engage
and leave to me the conduct of the car

whom answerd thus lycaons noble son
æneas of thy horses and thy car
take thou the charge beneath th accustomed hand
with more assurance would they draw the car
if we from tydeus son be forced to fly
nor struck with panic and thy voice unheard
refuse to bear us from the battlefield
so should ourselves be slain and tydeus son
in triumph drive thy horses to the ships
but thou thy horses and thy chariot guide
while i his onset with my lance receive

thus saying on the car they mounted both
and towrd tydides urgd their eager steeds
them sthenelus beheld the noble son
of capaneus and to tydides cried
oh son of tydeus dearest to my soul
two men i see of might invincible
impatient to engage thee pandarus
well skilld in archery lycaons son
with him æneas great anchises son
who from immortal venus boasts his birth
then let us timely to the car retreat
lest moving thus amid the foremost ranks
thy daring pay the forfeit of thy life

to whom brave diomed with stern regard
talk not to me of flight i heed thee not
it is not in my nature so to fight
with skulking artifice and faint retreat
my strength is yet unbroken i should shame
to mount the car but forward will i go
to meet these chiefs encounter for my soul
pallas forbids the touch of fear to know
nor shall their horses speed procure for both
a safe return though one escape my arm
this too i say and bear my words in mind
by pallas counsel if my hap should be
to slay them both leave thou my horses here
the reins attaching to the chariotrail
and seize and from the trojans to the ships
drive off the horses in æneas car
from those descended which allseeing jove
on tros for ganymede his son bestowd
with these may none beneath the sun compare
anchises king of men the breed obtaind
by cunning to the horses sending mares
without the knowledge of laomedon
six colts were thus engenderd four of these
in his own stalls he reard the other two
gave to æneas fearinspiring chief
these could we win our praise were great indeed

such converse while they held the twain approachd
their horses urgd to speed then thus began
to diomed lycaons noble son

great son of tydeus warrior brave and skilld
my shaft it seems has faild to reach thy life
try we then now what hap attends my spear
he said and poising hurld his pondrous spear
and struck tydides shield right through the shield
drove the keen weapon and the breastplate reachd
then shouted loud lycaons noble son
thou hast it through the flank nor canst thou long
survive the blow great glory now is mine

to whom unmovd the valiant diomed
thine aim hath failed i am not touchd and now
i deem we part not hence till one of ye
glut with his blood th insatiate lord of war

he said the spear by pallas guided struck
beside the nostril underneath the eye
crashd thro the teeth and cutting thro the tongue
beneath the angle of the jaw came forth
down from the car he fell and loudly rang
his glittring arms aside the startled steeds
sprang devious from his limbs the spirit fled
down leapd æneas spear and shield in hand
against the greeks to guard the valiant dead
and like a lion fearless in his strength
around the corpse he stalkd this way and that
his spear and buckler round before him held
to all who dard approach him threatning death
with fearful shouts a rocky fragment then
tydides lifted up a mighty mass
which scarce two men could raise as men are now
but he unaided lifted it with ease
with this he smote æneas near the groin
where the thighbone inserted in the hip
turns in the socketjoint the rugged mass
the socket crushd and both the tendons broke
and tore away the flesh down on his knees
yet resting on his hand the hero fell
and oer his eyes the shades of darkness spread
then had æneas king of men been slain
had not his mother venus child of jove
who to anchises where he fed his flocks
the hero bore his peril quickly seen
around her son she threw her snowy arms
and with a veil thickfolded wrapt him round
from hostile spears to guard him lest some greek
should pierce his breast and rob him of his life

she from the battle thus her son removed
nor did the son of capaneus neglect
the strict injunction by tydides givn
his reins attaching to the chariotrail
far from the battledin he checkd and left
his own fleet steeds then rushing forward seizd
and from the trojans towrd the camp drove off
the sleekskinnd horses of æneas car
these to deipylus his chosen friend
he gave of all his comrades best esteemd
of soundest judgment towrd the ships to drive
then his own car remounting seizd the reins
and urgd with eager haste his fiery steeds
seeking tydides he meanwhile pressd on
in keen pursuit of venus her he knew
a weak unwarlike goddess not of those
that like bellona fierce or pallas range
exulting through the bloodstaind fields of war

her searching thro the crowd at length he found
and springing forward with his pointed spear
a wound inflicted on her tender hand
piercing th ambrosial veil the graces work
the sharp spear grazd her palm below the wrist
forth from the wound th immortal current flowd
pure ichor lifestream of the blessed gods
they eat no bread they drink no ruddy wine
and bloodless thence and deathless they become
the goddess shriekd aloud and droppd her son
but in his arms apollo bore him off
in a thick cloud envelopd lest some greek
might pierce his breast and rob him of his life
loud shouted brave tydides as she fled
daughter of jove from battlefields retire
enough for thee weak woman to delude
if war thou seekst the lesson thou shalt learn
shall cause thee shudder but to hear it namd
thus he but ill at ease and sorely paind
the goddess fled her iris swift as wind
caught up and from the tumult bore away
weeping with pain her fair skin soild with blood

mars on the left hand of the battlefield
she found his spear reclining by his side
and veild in cloud his car and flying steeds
kneeling her brother she besought to lend
the flying steeds with golden frontlets crownd
dear brother aid me hence and lend thy car
to bear me to olympus seat of gods
great is the pain i suffer from a wound
receivd from diomed a mortal man
who now would dare with jove himself to fight

he lent the steeds with golden frontlets crownd
in deep distress she mounted on the car
beside her iris stood and took the reins
and urgd the coursers nothing loth they flew
and soon to high olympus seat of gods
they came swift iris there the coursers stayd
loosd from the chariot and before them placd
ambrosial forage on her mothers lap
dione venus fell she in her arms
embracd and soothd her with her hand and said
which of the heavnly powrs hath wrongd thee thus
my child as guilty of some open shame

whom answerd thus the laughterloving queen
the haughty son of tydeus diomed
hath wounded me because my dearest son
æneas from the field i bore away
no more twixt greeks and trojans is the fight
but with the gods themselves the greeks contend
to whom dione heavnly goddess thus
have patience dearest child though much enforcd
restrain thine anger we in heavn who dwell
have much to bear from mortals and ourselves
too oft upon each other suffrings lay
mars had his suffrings by aloeus sons
otus and ephialtes strongly bound
he thirteen months in brazen fetters lay
and there had pind away the god of war
insatiate mars had not their stepmother
the beauteous eriboea sought the aid
of hermes he by stealth releasd the god
sore worn and wasted by his galling chains
juno too sufferd when amphitryons son
through her right breast a threebarbd arrow sent
dire and unheard of were the pangs she bore
great plutos self the stinging arrow felt
when that same son of aegisbearing jove
assaild him in the very gates of hell
and wrought him keenest anguish piercd with pain
to high olympus to the courts of jove
groaning he came the bitter shaft remaind
deep in his shoulder fixd and grievd his soul
but soon with soothing ointments paeons hand
 heald the wound
accursd was he of daring overbold
reckless of evil deeds who with his bow
assaild the gods who on olympus dwell
the blueeyd pallas well i know has urgd
tydides to assail thee fool and blind
unknowing he how short his term of life
who fights against the gods for him no child
upon his knees shall lisp a fathers name
safe from the war and battlefield returnd
brave as he is let diomed beware
he meet not some more dangerous foe than thee
then fair ægiale adrastus child
the noble wife of valiant diomed
shall long with lamentations loud disturb
the slumbers of her house and vainly mourn
her youthful lord the bravest of the greeks
she said and wipd the ichor from the wound
the hand was heald the grievous pains allayd
but juno and minerva looking on
with words of bitter mockry saturns son
provokd and thus the blueeyd goddess spoke
o father may i speak without offence
venus it seems has sought to lead astray
some grecian woman and persuade to join
those trojans whom she holds in high esteem
and as her hand the gentle dame caressd
a golden clasp has scratched her slender arm

thus she and smild the sire of gods and men
he calld the golden venus to his side
and not to thee my child he said belong
the deeds of war do thou bestow thy care
on deeds of love and tender marriage ties
but leave to mars and pallas feats of arms

such converse while they held brave diomed
again assaild æneas well he knew
apollos guardian hand around him thrown
yet by the god undaunted on he pressd
to slay æneas and his arms obtain
thrice was his onset made with murdrous aim
and thrice apollo struck his glittring shield
but when with godlike force he sought to make
his fourth attempt the fardestroyer spoke
in terms of awful menace be advisd
tydides and retire nor as a god
esteem thyself since not alike the race
of gods immortal and of earthborn men

he said and diomed a little space
before the fardestroyers wrath retird
apollo then æneas bore away
far from the tumult and in pergamus
where stood his sacred shrine bestowd him safe
latona there and dian archerqueen
in the great temples innermost recess
gave to his wounds their care and soothd his pride
meanwhile apollo of the silver bow
a phantom form prepard the counterpart
of great æneas and alike in arms
around the form of trojans and of greeks
loud was the din of battle fierce the strokes
that fell on rounded shield of tough bullshide
and lighter targe before each warriors breast
then thus apollo to the god of war
mars mars thou bane of mortals bloodstaind lord
razer of cities wert not well thyself
to interpose and from the battlefield
withdraw this chief tydides such his pride
he now would dare with jove himself to fight
venus of late he wounded in the wrist
and like a god but now confronted me
he said and sat on iliums topmost height
while mars in likeness of the thracian chief
swift acamas amid the trojan ranks
movd to and fro and urgd them to the fight
to priams heavndescended sons he calld
ye sons of priam heavndescended king
how long will ye behold your people slain
till to your very doors the war be brought
æneas noblesould anchises son
in like esteem with hector held is down
on to his aid our gallant comrade save

he said his words fresh courage gave to all
then thus sarpedon in reproachful tone
addressd the godlike hector where is now
hector the spirit that heretofore was thine
twas once thy boast that evn without allies
thyself thy brethren and thy house alone
the city could defend for all of these
i look in vain and see not one they all
as curs around a lion cowr and crouch
we strangers and allies maintain the fight
i to your aid from lands afar remote
from lycia came by xanthus eddying stream
there left a cherishd wife and infant son
and rich possessions which might envy move
yet i my troops encourage and myself
have playd my part though nought have i to lose
nought that the greeks could drive or bear away
but thou standst idly by nor biddst the rest
maintain their ground and guard their wives and homes
beware lest ye as in the meshes caught
of some widesweeping net become the prey
and booty of your foes who soon shall lay
your prosprous city level with the dust
by day and night should this thy thoughts engage
with constant prayr to all thy brave allies
firmly to stand and wipe this shame away

he said and hector felt the biting speech
down from his car he leapd and through the ranks
two javlins brandishing he passd to arms
exciting all and raisd his battlecry
the tide was turnd again they facd the greeks
in serried ranks the greeks undaunted stood
as when the wind from off a threshingfloor
where men are winnowing blows the chaff away
when yellow ceres with the breeze divides
the corn and chaff which lies in whitning heaps
so thick the greeks were whitend oer with dust
which to the brazen vault of heavn arose
beneath the horses feet that with the crowd
were mingled by their drivers turnd to flight
unwearied still they bore the brunt but mars
the trojans succouring the battlefield
veild in thick clouds from evry quarter brought
thus he of phoebus of the golden sword
obeyd th injunction bidding him arouse
the courage of the trojans when he saw
pallas approaching to support the greeks

then from the wealthy shrine apollos self
æneas brought and vigour fresh infusd
amid his comrades once again he stood
they joyd to see him yet alive and sound
and full of vigour yet no question askd
no time for question then amid the toils
imposd by phoebus of the silver bow
and bloodstaind mars and discord unappeasd

meanwhile ulysses and th ajaces both
and diomed with courage for the fight
the grecian force inspird they undismayd
shrank not before the trojans rush and charge
in masses firm they stood as when the clouds
are gatherd round the misty mountain top
by saturns son in breathless calm while sleep
the force of boreas and the stormy winds
that with their breath the shadowy clouds disperse
so stood the greeks nor shunnd the trojans charge
through all the army agamemnon passd
and cried brave comrades quit ye now like men
bear a stout heart and in the stubborn fight
let each to other mutual succour give
by mutual succour more are savd than fall
in timid flight nor fame nor safety lies

thus he and straight his javlin threw and struck
a man of mark æneas faithful friend
deicoon the son of pergasus
by troy as ever foremost in the field
in equal honour held with priams sons
his shield the monarch agamemnon struck
the shields defence was vain the spear passd through
beneath the belt and in his groin was lodgd
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang

on th other side æneas slew two chiefs
the bravest of the greeks orsilochus
and crethon sons of diocles who dwelt
in thriving phera rich in substance he
and from the mighty river alpheus tracd
his high descent who through the pylian land
his copious waters pours to him was born
orsilochus of numrous tribes the chief
to him succeeded valiant diocles
to whom were born twin sons orsilochus
and crethon skilld in evry point of war
they in the vigour of their youth to troy
had saild amid the darkribbd ships of greece
of atreus sons the quarrel to uphold
but oer them both the shades of death were spread
as two young lions by their tawny dam
nursd in the mountain forests deep recess
on flocks and herds their youthful fury pour
with havoc to the sheepfolds till themselves
succumb oermasterd by the hand of man
so fell these two beneath æneas hand
and like two lofty pines in death they lay

the warlike menelaus saw their fall
with pitying eye and through the foremost ranks
with brandishd spear advancd by mars impelld
who hopd his death by great æneas hand
him nestors son antilochus beheld
and hastend to his aid for much he feard
lest ill befall the monarch and his death
deprive them of their warlike labours fruit
they two with force combined of hand and spear
pressd onward to the fight antilochus
his station keeping close beside the king
before the two combined æneas feard
bold warrior as he was to hold his ground
the slain they drew within the grecian lines
placed in their comrades hands and turning back
amid the foremost mingled in the fray
then brave as mars pylaemenes they slew
the bucklerd paphlagonians warlike chief
him menelaus hand to hand engagd
piercd with a spearthrust through the collarbone
while with a pondrous stone antilochus
full on the elbow smote atymnius son
mydon his charioteer in act to turn
his fiery steeds to flight down from his hands
fell to the ground the ivrymounted reins
on rushd antilochus and with his sword
across the temples smote him gasping he
upon his neck and shoulders from the car
pitchd headlong and 
awhile stood balancd till the horses feet
dashd him upon the ground antilochus
the horses seizing drove them to the ships

hector beheld athwart the ranks and rushd
loud shouting to th encounter at his back
followd the thronging bands of troy by mars
and fierce bellona led she by the hand
wild uproar held while mars a giant spear
brandishd aloft and stalking now before
now following after hector urgd them on
quaild at the sight the valiant diomed
as when a man long journeying oer the plain
all unprepard stands sudden on the brink
of a swift stream down rushing to the sea
boiling with foam and back recoils so then
recoild tydides and addressd the crowd
o friends we marvel at the might displayd
by hector spearman skilld and warrior bold
but still some guardian god his steps attends
and shields from danger now beside him stands
in likeness of a mortal mars himself
then turning still your faces to your foes
retire nor venture with the gods to fight

he said the trojans now were close at hand
and mounted both upon a single car
two chiefs menesthes and anchialus
well skilld in war by hectors hand were slain

with pitying eyes great ajax telamon
beheld their fall advancing close he threw
his glittring spear the son of selagus
it struck amphius who in paesus dwelt
in land and substance rich by evil fate
impelld to priams house he brought his aid
below the belt the spear of ajax struck
and in his groin the point was buried deep
thundring he fell then forward ajax sprang
to seize the spoils of war but fast and fierce
the trojans showrd their weapons bright and keen
and many a lance the mighty shield receivd
ajax his foot firm planted on the slain
withdrew the brazen spear yet could not strip
his armour off so galling flew the shafts
and much he feard his foes might hem him in
who closely pressd upon him many and brave
and valiant as he was and tall and strong
still drove him backward he perforce retired

thus labourd they amid the stubborn fight
then evil fate inducd tlepolemus
valiant and strong the son of hercules
heavnborn sarpedon to confront in fight
when near they came of cloudcompelling jove
grandson and son tlepolemus began
sarpedon lycian chief what brings thee here
trembling and crouching all unskilld in war
falsely they speak who fable thee the son
of aegisbearing jove so far art thou
beneath their mark who claimd in elder days
that royal lineage such my father was
of courage resolute of lion heart
with but six ships and with a scanty band
the horses by laomedon withheld
avenging he oerthrew this city troy
and made her streets a desert but thy soul
is poor thy troops are wasting fast away
nor deem i that the trojans will in thee
 and lycias aid
their safeguard find but vanquishd by my hand
this day the gates of hades thou shalt pass

to whom the lycian chief sarpedon thus
tlepolemus the sacred walls of troy
thy sire oerthrew by folly of one man
laomedon who with injurious words
his noble service recompensd nor gave
the promisd steeds for which he came from far
for thee i deem thou now shalt meet thy doom
here at my hand on thee my spear shall win
renown for me thy soul to hades send

thus as sarpedon spoke tlepolemus
upraisd his ashen spear from both their hands
the pondrous weapons simultaneous flew
full in the throat tlepolemus receivd
sarpedons spear right through the neck it passd
and oer his eyes the shades of death were spread
on th other side his spear sarpedon struck
on the left thigh the eager weapon passd
right through the flesh and in the bone was fixd
the stroke of death his father turnd aside
sarpedon from the field his comrades bore
weighd down and tortured by the trailing spear
for in their haste to bear him to his car
not one bethought him from his thigh to draw
the weapon forth so sorely were they pressd

the greeks too from the battlefield conveyd
the slain tlepolemus ulysses saw
patient of spirit but deeply movd at heart
and with conflicting thoughts his breast was torn
if first he should pursue the thundrers son
or deal destruction on the lycian host
but fate had not decreed the valiant son
of jove to fall beneath ulysses hand
so on the lycians pallas turnd his wrath
alastor then and coeranus he slew
chromius alcander halius prytanis
noemon nor had ended then the list
of lycian warriors by ulysses slain
but hector of the glancing helm beheld
through the front ranks he rushd with burnishd crest
resplendent flashing terror on the greeks
with joy sarpedon saw his near approach
and with imploring tones addressd him thus

hector thou son of priam leave me not
a victim to the greeks but lend thine aid
then in your city let me end my days
for not to me is givn again to see
my native land or safe returning home
to glad my sorrowing wife and infant child

thus he but hector answring not a word
passd on in silence hasting to pursue
the greeks and pour destruction on their host

beneath the oak of aegisbearing jove
his faithful comrades laid sarpedon down
and from his thigh the valiant pelagon
his lovd companion drew the ashen spear
he swoond and giddy mists oerspread his eyes
but soon revivd as on his forehead blew
while yet he gaspd for breath the cooling breeze

by mars and hector of the brazen helm
the greeks hardpressd yet fled not to their ships
nor yet sustaind the fight but back retird
soon as they learned the presence of the god
say then who first who last the prowess felt
of hector priams son and mailclad mars
the godlike teuthras first orestes next
bold charioteer th ætolian spearman skilld
trechus œnomaus and helenus
the son of œnops and oresbius girt
with sparkling girdle he in hyla dwelt
the careful lord of boundless wealth beside
cephisus marshy banks bœotias chiefs
around him dwelt on fat and fertile soil
juno the whitearmd queen who saw these two
the greeks destroying in the stubborn fight
to pallas thus her winged words addressd
o heavn brave child of aegisbearing jove
vain was our word to menelaus givn
that he the wellbuilt walls of troy should raze
and safe return if unrestraind we leave
ferocious mars to urge his mad career
come then let us too mingle in the fray

she said and pallas blueeyd maid complied
offspring of saturn juno heavnly queen
herself th immortal steeds caparisond
adornd with golden frontlets to the car
hebe the circling wheels of brass attachd
eightspokd that on an iron axle turnd
the felloes were of gold and fitted round
with brazen tires a marvel to behold
the naves were silver rounded every way
the chariotboard on gold and silver bands
was hung and round it ran a double rail
the pole was all of silver at the end
a golden yoke with golden yokebands fair
and juno all on fire to join the fray
beneath the yoke the flying coursers led

pallas the child of aegisbearing jove
within her fathers threshold droppd her veil
of airy texture work of her own hands
the cuirass donnd of cloudcompelling jove
and stood accoutred for the bloody fray
her tasselld aegis round her shoulders next
she threw with terror circled all around
and on its face were figurd deeds of arms
and strife and courage high and panic rout
there too a gorgons head of monstrous size
frownd terrible portent of angry jove
and on her head a golden helm she placd
fourcrested doublepeakd whose ample verge
a hundred cities champions might suffice
her fiery car she mounted in her hand
a spear she bore long weighty tough wherewith
the mighty daughter of a mighty sire
sweeps down the ranks of those her hate pursues

then juno sharply touchd the flying steeds
forthwith spontaneous opening grated harsh
the heavenly portals guarded by the hours
who heavn and high olympus have in charge
to roll aside or draw the veil of cloud
through these th excited horses held their way
they found the son of saturn from the gods
sitting apart upon the highest crest
of manyridgd olympus there arrivd
the whitearmd goddess juno stayd her steeds
and thus addressd the sovreign lord of heavn

o father jove canst thou behold unmovd
the violence of mars how many greeks
reckless and uncontrolld he hath destroyd
to me a source of bitter grief meanwhile
venus and phoebus of the silver bow
look on well pleasd who sent this madman forth
to whom both law and justice are unknown
say father jove shall i thine anger move
if with disgrace i drive him from the field

to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
go send against him pallas she i know
hath oft inflicted on him grievous pain

he said the whitearmd queen with joy obeyd
she urgd her horses nothing loth they flew
midway between the earth and starry heavn
far as his sight extends who from on high
looks from his watchtowr oer the darkblue sea
so far at once the neighing horses bound
but when to troy they came beside the streams
where simois and scamanders waters meet
the whitearmd goddess stayd her flying steeds
loosd from the car and veild in densest cloud
for them at bidding of the rivergod
ambrosial forage grew the goddesses
swift as the wild woodpigeons rapid flight
sped to the battlefield to aid the greeks
but when they reachd the thickest of the fray
where throngd around the might of diomed
the bravest and the best as lions fierce
or forestboars the mightiest of their kind
there stood the whitearmd queen and calld aloud
in form of stentor of the brazen voice
whose shout was as the shout of fifty men

shame on ye greeks base cowards brave alone
in outward semblance while achilles yet
went forth to battle from the dardan gates
the trojans never venturd to advance
so dreaded they his pondrous spear but now
far from the walls beside your ships they fight

she said her words their drooping courage rousd
meanwhile the blueeyd pallas went in haste
in search of tydeus son beside his car
she found the king in act to cool the wound
inflicted by the shaft of pandarus
beneath his shields broad belt the clogging sweat
oppressd him and his arm was faint with toil
the belt was lifted up and from the wound
he wipd the clotted blood beside the car
the goddess stood and touchd the yoke and said

little like tydeus self is tydeus son
low was his stature but his spirit was high
and evn when i from combat rashly wagd
would fain have kept him back what time in thebes
he found himself an envoy and alone
without support among the thebans all
i counselld him in peace to share the feast
but by his own impetuous courage led
he challenged all the thebans to contend
with him in wrestling and oerthrew them all
with ease so mighty was the aid i gave
thee now i stand beside and guard from harm
and bid thee boldly with the trojans fight
but if the labours of the battlefield
oertask thy limbs or heartless fear restrain
no issue thou of valiant tydeus loins

whom answerd thus the valiant diomed
i know thee goddess who thou art the child
of aegisbearing jove to thee my mind
i freely speak nor aught will i conceal
nor heartless fear nor hesitating doubt
restrain me but i bear thy words in mind
with other of th immortals not to fight
but should joves daughter venus dare the fray
at her i need not shun to throw my spear
therefore i thus withdrew and others too
exhorted to retire since mars himself
i saw careering oer the battlefield

to whom the blueeyd goddess pallas thus
thou son of tydeus dearest to my soul
fear now no more with mars himself to fight
nor other god such aid will i bestow
come then at him the first direct thy car
encounter with him hand to hand nor fear
to strike this madman this incarnate curse
this shameless renegade who late agreed
with juno and with me to combat troy
and aid the grecian cause who now appears
the greeks deserting in the trojan ranks

thus pallas spoke and stretching forth her hand
backward his comrade sthenelus she drew
from off the chariot down in haste he sprang
his place beside the valiant diomed
the eager goddess took beneath the weight
loud groand the oaken axle for the car
a mighty goddess and a hero bore
then pallas took the whip and reins and urgd
direct at mars the fiery coursers speed

the bravest of th ætolians periphas
ochesius stalwart son he just had slain
and stood in act to strip him of his arms
the helmet then of darkness pallas donnd
to hide her presence from the sight of mars
but when the bloodstaind god of war beheld
advancing towrd him godlike diomed
the corpse of stalwart periphas he left
there where he fell to lie while he himself
of valiant diomed th encounter met
when near they came first mars his pondrous spear
advancd beyond the yoke and horses reins
with murdrous aim but pallas from the car
turnd it aside and foild the vain attempt

then diomed thrust forward in his turn
his pondrous spear low on the flank of mars
guided by pallas with successful aim
just where the belt was girt the weapon struck
it piercd the flesh and straight was back withdrawn
then mars cried out aloud with such a shout
as if nine thousand or ten thousand men
should simultaneous raise their battlecry
trojans and greeks alike in terror heard
trembling so fearful was the cry of mars
as black with clouds appears the darkend air
when after heat the blustring winds arise
so mars to valiant diomed appeard
as in thick clouds he took his heavnward flight
with speed he came to great olympus heights
th abode of gods and sitting by the throne
of saturns son with anguish torn he showd
th immortal stream that trickled from the wound
and thus to jove his piteous words addressd

o father jove canst thou behold unmovd
these acts of violence the greatest ills
we gods endure we each to other owe
who still in human quarrels interpose
of thee we all complain thy senseless child
is ever on some evil deed intent
the other gods who on olympus dwell
are all to thee obedient and submiss
but thy pernicious daughter nor by word
nor deed dost thou restrain who now excites
th oerbearing son of tydeus diomed
upon th immortal gods to vent his rage
venus of late he wounded in the wrist
and as a god but now encounterd me
barely i scapd by swiftness of my feet
else mid a ghastly heap of corpses slain
in anguish had i lain and if alive
yet livd disabld by his weapons stroke

whom answerd thus the cloudcompeller jove
with look indignant come no more to me
thou wavring turncoat with thy whining prayrs
of all the gods who on olympus dwell
i hate thee most for thou delightst in nought
but strife and war thou hast inherited
thy mother junos proud unbending mood
whom i can scarce control and thou methinks
to her suggestions owst thy present plight
yet since thou art my offspring and to me
thy mother bore thee i must not permit
that thou shouldst long be doomd to suffer pain
but had thy birth been other than it is
for thy misdoings thou hadst long ere now
been banishd from the gods companionship

he said and straight to paeon gave command
to heal the wound with soothing anodynes
he heald it quickly soon as liquid milk
is curdled by the figtrees juice and turns
in whirling flakes so soon was heald the wound
by hebe bathd and robd afresh he sat
in health and strength restord by saturns son

mars thus arrested in his murdrous course
together to th abode of jove returnd
the queen of argos and the blueeyd maid





the gods had left the field and oer the plain
hither and thither surgd the tide of war
as couchd th opposing chiefs their brasstippd spears
midway twixt simois and scamanders streams

first through the trojan phalanx broke his way
the son of telamon the prop of greece
the mighty ajax on his friends the light
of triumph shedding as eusorus son
he smote the noblest of the thracian bands
valiant and strong the gallant acamas
full in the front beneath the plumed helm
the sharp spear struck and crashing thro the bone
the warriors eyes were closd in endless night

next valiant diomed axylus slew
the son of teuthranes who had his home
in fair arisba rich in substance he
and lovd of all for dwelling near the road
he opd to all his hospitable gate
but none of all he entertaind was there
to ward aside the bitter doom of death
there fell they both he and his charioteer
calesius who athwart the battlefield
his chariot drove one fate oertook them both

then dresus and opheltius of their arms
euryalus despoild his hot pursuit
æsepus next and pedasus assaild
brothers whom abarbarea naiad nymph
to bold bucolion bore bucolion son
of great laomedon his eldest born
though bastard he upon the mountain side
on which his flocks he tended met the nymph
and of their secret loves twin sons were born
whom now at once euryalus of strength
and life deprivd and of their armour strippd

by polypoetes hand in battle strong
was slain astyalus pidutes fell
chief of percote by ulysses spear
and teucer godlike aretaon slew
antilochus the son of nestor smote
with gleaming lance ablerus elatus
by agamemnon king of men was slain
who dwelt by satnois widelyflowing stream
upon the lofty heights of pedasus
by leitus was phylacus in flight
oertaen eurypylus melanthius slew

then menelaus good in battle took
adrastus captive for his horses scard
and rushing wildly oer the plain amid
the tangled tamarisk scrub his chariot broke
snapping the pole they with the flying crowd
held cityward their course he from the car
hurld headlong prostrate lay beside the wheel
prone on his face in dust and at his side
poising his mighty spear atrides stood
adrastus claspd his knees and suppliant cried
spare me great son of atreus for my life
accept a price my wealthy fathers house
a goodly store contains of brass and gold
and wellwrought iron and of these he fain
would pay a noble ransom could he hear
that in the grecian ships i yet survivd

his words to pity movd the victors breast
then had he bade his followers to the ships
the captive bear but running up in haste
fierce agamemnon cried in stern rebuke

softhearted menelaus why of life
so tender hath thy house receivd indeed
nothing but benefits at trojan hands
of that abhorred race let not a man
escape the deadly vengeance of our arms
no not the infant in its mothers womb
no nor the fugitive but be they all
they and their city utterly destroyd
uncard for and from memry blotted out

thus as he spoke his counsel fraught with death
his brothers purpose changd he with his hand
adrastus thrust aside whom with his lance
fierce agamemnon through the loins transfixd
and as he rolld in death upon his breast
planting his foot the ashen spear withdrew

then loudly nestor shouted to the greeks
friends grecian heroes ministers of mars
loiter not now behind to throw yourselves
upon the prey and bear it to the ships
let all your aim be now to kill anon
ye may at leisure spoil your slaughterd foes

with words like these he fird the blood of all
now had the trojans by the warlike greeks
in coward flight within their walls been drivn
but to æneas and to hector thus
the son of priam helenus the best
of all the trojan seers addressd his speech
æneas and thou hector since on you
of all the trojans and the lycian hosts
is laid the heaviest burthen for that ye
excel alike in council and in fight
stand here awhile and moving to and fro
on evry side around the gates exhort
the troops to rally lest they fall disgracd
flying for safety to their womens arms
and foes exulting triumph in their shame
their courage thus restord worn as we are
we with the greeks will still maintain the fight
for so perforce we must but hector thou
haste to the city there our mother find
both thine and mine on iliums topmost height
by all the aged dames accompanied
bid her the shrine of blueeyd pallas seek
unlock the sacred gates and on the knees
of fairhaird pallas place the fairest robe
in all the house the amplest best esteemd
and at her altar vow to sacrifice
twelve yearling kine that never felt the goad
so she have pity on the trojan state
our wives and helpless babes and turn away
the fiery son of tydeus spearman fierce
the minister of terror bravest he
in my esteem of all the grecian chiefs
for not achilles self the prince of men
though goddessborn such dread inspird so fierce
his rage and with his prowess none may vie

he said nor uncomplying hector heard
his brothers counsel from his car he leapd
in arms upon the plain and brandishd high
his javlins keen and moving to and fro
the troops encouragd and restord the fight
rallying they turnd and facd again the greeks
these ceasd from slaughter and in turn gave way
deeming that from the starry heavn some god
had to the rescue come so fierce they turnd
then to the trojans hector calld aloud

ye valiant trojans and renownd allies
quit you like men remember now brave friends
your wonted valour i to ilium go
to bid our wives and revrend elders raise
to heavn their prayrs with vows of hecatombs

thus saying hector of the glancing helm
turnd to depart and as he movd along
the black bullshide his neck and ancles smote
the outer circle of his bossy shield

then tydeus son and glaucus in the midst
son of hippolochus stood forth to fight
but when they near were met to glaucus first
the valiant diomed his speech addressd
who art thou boldest man of mortal birth
for in the glorious conflict heretofore
i neer have seen thee but in daring now
thou far surpassest all who hast not feard
to face my spear of most unhappy sires
the children they who my encounter meet
but if from heavn thou comst and art indeed
a god i fight not with the heavnly powers
not long did dryas son lycurgus brave
survive who dard th immortals to defy
he mid their frantic orgies in the groves
of lovely nyssa put to shameful rout
the youthful bacchus nurses they in fear
droppd each her thyrsus scatterd by the hand
of fierce lycurgus with an oxgoad armd
bacchus himself beneath the ocean wave
in terror plungd and trembling refuge found
in thetis bosom from a mortals threats
the gods indignant saw and saturns son
smote him with blindness nor survivd he long
hated alike by all th immortal gods
i dare not then the blessed gods oppose
but be thou mortal and the fruits of earth
thy food approach and quickly meet thy doom

to whom the noble glaucus thus replied
great son of tydeus why my race enquire
the race of man is as the race of leaves
of leaves one generation by the wind
is scattered on the earth another soon
in springs luxuriant verdure bursts to light
so with our race these flourish those decay
but if thou wouldst in truth enquire and learn
the race i spring from not unknown of men
there is a city in the deep recess
of pastoral argos ephyre by name
there sisyphus of old his dwelling had
of mortal men the craftiest sisyphus
the son of æolus to him was born
glaucus and glaucus in his turn begot
bellerophon on whom the gods bestowd
the gifts of beauty and of manly grace
but proetus sought his death and mightier far
from all the coasts of argos drove him forth
to proetus subjected by joves decree
for him the monarchs wife antaea nursd
a maddning passion and to guilty love
would fain have tempted him but faild to move
the upright soul of chaste bellerophon
with lying words she then addressd the king
die proetus thou or slay bellerophon
who basely sought my honour to assail
the king with anger listend to her words
slay him he would not that his soul abhorrd
but to the father of his wife the king
of lycia sent him forth with tokens chargd
of dire import on folded tablets tracd
poisning the monarchs mind to work his death
to lycia guarded by the gods he went
but when he came to lycia and the streams
of xanthus there with hospitable rites
the king of widespread lycia welcomd him
nine days he feasted him nine oxen slew
but with the tenth return of rosy morn
he questiond him and for the tokens askd
he from his soninlaw from proetus bore
the tokens fatal import understood
he bade him first the dread chimaera slay
a monster sent from heavn not human born
with head of lion and a serpents tail
and body of a goat and from her mouth
there issued flames of fiercelyburning fire
yet her confiding in the gods he slew
next with the valiant solymi he fought
the fiercest fight that eer he undertook
thirdly the womenwarriors he oerthrew
the amazons from whom returning home
the king another stratagem devisd
for choosing out the best of lycias sons
he set an ambush they returnd not home
for all by brave bellerophon were slain
but by his valour when the king perceivd
his heavnly birth he entertaind him well
gave him his daughter and with her the half
of all his royal honours he bestowd
a portion too the lycians meted out
fertile in corn and wine of all the state
the choicest land to be his heritage
three children there to brave bellerophon
were born isander and hippolochus
laodamia last belovd of jove
the lord of counsel and to him she bore
godlike sarpedon of the brazen helm
bellerophon at length the wrath incurrd
of all the gods and to th aleian plain
alone he wanderd there he wore away
his soul and shunnd the busy haunts of men
insatiate mars his son isander slew
in battle with the valiant solymi
his daughter perishd by dianas wrath
i from hippolochus my birth derive
to troy he sent me and enjoind me oft
to aim at highest honours and surpass
my comrades all nor on my fathers name
discredit bring who held the foremost place
in ephyre and lycias wide domain
such is my race and such the blood i boast

he said and diomed rejoicing heard
his spear he planted in the fruitful ground
and thus with friendly words the chief addressd

by ancient ties of friendship are we bound
for godlike œneus in his house receivd
for twenty days the brave bellerophon
they many a gift of friendship interchangd
a belt with crimson glowing œneus gave
bellerophon a double cup of gold
which in my house i left when here i came
of tydeus no remembrance i retain
for yet a child he left me when he fell
with his achaians at the gate of thebes
so i in argos am thy friendly host
thou mine in lycia when i thither come
then shun we een amid the thickest fight
each others lance enough there are for me
of trojans and their brave allies to kill
as heavn may aid me and my speed of foot
and greeks enough there are for thee to slay
if so indeed thou canst but let us now
our armour interchange that these may know
what friendly bonds of old our houses join
thus as they spoke they quitted each his car
claspd hand in hand and plighted mutual faith
then glaucus of his judgment jove deprivd
his armour interchanging gold for brass
a hundred oxens worth for that of nine

meanwhile when hector reachd the oak beside
the scaean gate around him throngd the wives
of troy and daughters anxious to enquire
the fate of children brothers husbands friends
he to the gods exhorted all to pray
for deep the sorrows that oer many hung
but when to priams splendid house he came
with polishd corridors adorndwithin
were fifty chambers all of polishd stone
placd each by other there the fifty sons
of priam with their wedded wives reposd
on th other side within the court were built
twelve chambers near the roof of polishd stone
placd each by other there the sonsinlaw
of priam with their spouses chaste reposd
to meet him there his tender mother came
and with her led the young laodice
fairest of all her daughters clasping then
his hands she thus addressd him why my son
why comst thou here and leavst the battlefield
are trojans by those hateful sons of greece
fighting around the city sorely pressd
and comst thou by thy spirit movd to raise
on iliums heights thy hands in prayr to jove
but tarry till i bring the luscious wine
that first to jove and to th immortals all
thou mayst thine offring pour then with the draught
thyself thou mayst refresh for great the strength
which genrous wine imparts to men who toil
as thou hast toild thy comrades to protect

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
no not for me mine honourd mother pour
the luscious wine lest thou unnerve my limbs
and make me all my wonted prowess lose
the ruddy wine i dare not pour to jove
with hands unwashd nor to the cloudgirt son
of saturn may the voice of prayr ascend
from one with blood bespatterd and defild
thou with the elder women seek the shrine
of pallas bring your gifts and on the knees
of fairhaird pallas place the fairest robe
in all the house the amplest best esteemd
and at her altar vow to sacrifice
twelve yearling kine that never felt the goad
so she have pity on the trojan state
our wives and helpless babes and turn away
the fiery son of tydeus spearman fierce
the minister of terror to the shrine
of pallas thou to paris i to call
if haply he will hear would that the earth
would gape and swallow him for great the curse
that jove thro him hath brought on men of troy
on noble priam and on priams sons
could i but know that he were in his grave
methinks my sorrows i could half forget

he said she to the house returning sent
th attendants through the city to collect
the train of aged suppliants she meanwhile
her fragrant chamber sought wherein were stord
rich garments by sidonian women workd
whom godlike paris had from sidon brought
sailing the broad sea oer the selfsame path
by which the highborn helen he conveyd
of these the richest in embroidery
the amplest and the brightest as a star
refulgent placd with care beneath the rest
the queen her offring bore to pallas shrine
she went and with her many an ancient dame
but when the shrine they reachd on iliums height
theano fair of face the gates unlockd
daughter of cisseus sage antenors wife
by trojans namd at pallas shrine to serve
they with deep moans to pallas raisd their hands
but fair theano took the robe and placd
on pallas knees and to the heavnly maid
daughter of jove she thus addressd her prayr
guardian of cities pallas awful queen
goddess of goddesses break thou the spear
of tydeus son and grant that he himself
prostrate before the scaean gates may fall
so at thine altar will we sacrifice
twelve yearling kine that never felt the goad
if thou have pity on the state of troy
the wives of trojans and their helpless babes

thus she but pallas answerd not her prayr
while thus they calld upon the heavnly maid
hector to paris mansion bent his way
a noble structure which himself had built
aided by all the best artificers
who in the fertile realm of troy were known
with chambers hall and court on iliums height
near to where priams self and hector dwelt
there enterd hector well belovd of jove
and in his hand his pondrous spear he bore
twelve cubits long bright flashd the weapons point
of polishd brass with circling hoop of gold
there in his chamber found he whom he sought
about his armour busied polishing
his shield his breastplate and his bended bow
while argive helen mid her maidens placd
the skilful labours of their hands oerlookd
to him thus hector with reproachful words
thou dost not well thine anger to indulge
in battle round the citys lofty wall
the people fast are falling thou the cause
that fiercely thus around the city burns
the flame of war and battle and thyself
wouldst others blame who from the fight should shrink
up ere the town be wrappd in hostile fires

to whom in answer godlike paris thus
hector i own not causeless thy rebuke
yet will i speak hear thou and understand
twas less from anger with the trojan host
and fierce resentment that i here remaind
than that i sought my sorrow to indulge
yet hath my wife een now with soothing words
urgd me to join the battle so i own
twere best and victry changes oft her side
then stay while i my armour don or thou
go first i following will oertake thee soon

he said but hector of the glancing helm
made answer none then thus with gentle tones
helen accosted him dear brother mine

oh that the day my mother gave me birth
some storm had on the mountains cast me forth
or that the manydashing oceans waves
had swept me off ere all this woe were wrought
yet if these evils were of heavn ordaind
would that a better man had calld me wife
a sounder judge of honour and disgrace
for he thou knowst no firmness hath of mind
nor ever will a want he well may rue
but come thou in and rest thee here awhile
dear brother on this couch for travail sore
encompasseth thy soul by me imposd
degraded as i am and paris guilt
on whom this burthen heavn hath laid that shame
on both our names through years to come shall rest

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
though kind thy wish yet helen ask me not
to sit or rest i cannot yield to thee
for to the succour of our friends i haste
who feel my loss and sorely need my aid
but thou thy husband rouse and let him speed
that he may find me still within the walls
for i too homeward go to see once more
my household and my wife and infant child
for whether i may eer again return
i know not or if heavn have so decreed
that i this day by grecian hands should fall

thus saying hector of the glancing helm
turnd to depart with rapid step he reachd
his own wellfurnished house but found not there
his whitearmd spouse the fair andromache
she with her infant child and maid the while
was standing bathd in tears in bitter grief
on iliums topmost tower but when her lord
found not within the house his peerless wife
upon the threshold pausing thus he spoke
tell me my maidens tell me true which way
your mistress went the fair andromache
or to my sisters or my brothers wives
or to the temple where the fairhaird dames
of troy invoke minervas awful name

to whom the matron of his house replied
hector if truly we must answer thee
not to thy sisters nor thy brothers wives
nor to the temple where the fairhaird dames
of troy invoke minervas awful name
but to the height of iliums topmost towr
andromache is gone since tidings came
the trojan force was overmatchd and great
the grecian strength whereat like one distract
she hurried to the walls and with her took
borne in the nurses arms her infant child

so spoke the ancient dame and hector straight
through the wide streets his rapid steps retracd
but when at last the mighty citys length
was traversd and the scaean gates were reachd
whence was the outlet to the plain in haste
running to meet him came his priceless wife
eetions daughter fair andromache
eetion who from thebes cilicia swayd
thebes at the foot of placos wooded heights
his child to hector of the brazen helm
was givn in marriage she it was who now
met him and by her side the nurse who bore
claspd to her breast his all unconscious child
hectors lovd infant fair as morning star
whom hector calld scamandrius but the rest
astyanax in honour of his sire
the matchless chief the only prop of troy
silent he smild as on his boy he gazd
but at his side andromache in tears
hung on his arm and thus the chief addressd

dear lord thy dauntless spirit will work thy doom
nor hast thou pity on this thy helpless child
or me forlorn to be thy widow soon
for thee will all the greeks with force combind
assail and slay for me twere better far
of thee bereft to lie beneath the sod
nor comfort shall be mine if thou be lost
but endless grief to me nor sire is left
nor honourd mother fell achilles hand
my sire eetion slew what time his arms
the populous city of cilicia razd
the loftygated thebes he slew indeed
but strippd him not he reverencd the dead
and oer his body with his armour burnt
a mound erected and the mountain nymphs
the progeny of aegisbearing jove
planted around his tomb a grove of elms
there were sevn brethren in my fathers house
all in one day they fell amid their herds
and fleecy flocks by fierce achilles hand
my mother queen of placos wooded height
brought with the captives here he soon releasd
for costly ransom but by dians shafts
she in her fathers house was stricken down
but hector thou to me art all in one
sire mother brethren thou my wedded love
then pitying us within the towr remain
nor make thy child an orphan and thy wife
a hapless widow by the figtree here
array thy troops for here the city wall
easiest of access most invites assault
thrice have their boldest chiefs this point assaild
the two ajaces brave idomeneus
th atridae both and tydeus warlike son
or by the prompting of some heavntaught seer
or by their own adventrous courage led

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
think not dear wife that by such thoughts as these
my heart has neer been wrung but i should blush
to face the men and longrobd dames of troy
if like a coward i could shun the fight
nor could my soul the lessons of my youth
so far forget whose boast it still has been
in the forefront of battle to be found
chargd with my fathers glory and mine own
yet in my inmost soul too well i know
the day must come when this our sacred troy
and priams race and priams royal self
shall in one common ruin be oerthrown
but not the thoughts of troys impending fate
nor hecubas nor royal priams woes
nor loss of brethren numerous and brave
by hostile hands laid prostrate in the dust
so deeply wring my heart as thoughts of thee
thy days of freedom lost and led away
a weeping captive by some brassclad greek
haply in argos at a mistress beck
condemnd to ply the loom or water draw
from hypereias or messeis fount
heartwrung by stern necessity constraind
then they who see thy tears perchance may say
lo this was hectors wife who when they fought
on plains of troy was iliums bravest chief
thus may they speak and thus thy grief renew
for loss of him who might have been thy shield
to rescue thee from slavrys bitter hour
oh may i sleep in dust ere be condemnd
to hear thy cries and see thee draggd away

thus as he spoke great hector stretchd his arms
to take his child but back the infant shrank
crying and sought his nurses sheltring breast
scard by the brazen helm and horsehair plume
that nodded fearful on the warriors crest
laughd the fond parents both and from his brow
hector the casque removd and set it down
all glittring on the ground then kissd his child
and dancd him in his arms then thus to jove
and to th immortals all addressd his prayr
grant jove and all ye gods that this my son
may be as i the foremost man of troy
for valour famd his countrys guardian king
that men may say this youth surpasses far
his father when they see him from the fight
from slaughterd foes with bloody spoils of war
returning to rejoice his mothers heart

thus saying in his mothers arms he placd
his child she to her fragrant bosom claspd
smiling through tears with eyes of pitying love
hector beheld and pressd her hand and thus
addressd herdearest wring not thus my heart
for till my day of destiny is come
no man may take my life and when it comes
nor brave nor coward can escape that day
but go thou home and ply thy household cares
the loom and distaff and appoint thy maids
their sevral tasks and leave to men of troy
and chief of all to me the toils of war

great hector said and raisd his plumed helm
and homeward slow with oftreverted eyes
shedding hot tears his sorrowing wife returnd
arrivd at valiant hectors wellbuilt house
her maidens pressd around her and in all
arose at once the sympathetic grief
for hector yet alive his household mournd
deeming he never would again return
safe from the fight by grecian hands unharmd

nor lingerd paris in his lofty halls
but donnd his armour glittring oer with brass
and through the city passd with bounding steps
as some proud steed at wellfilld manger fed
his halter broken neighing scours the plain
and revels in the widelyflowing stream
to bathe his sides then tossing high his head
while oer his shoulders streams his ample mane
light borne on active limbs in conscious pride
to the wide pastures of the mares he flies
so paris priams son from iliums height
his bright arms flashing like the gorgeous sun
hastend with boastful mien and rapid step
hector he found as from the spot he turnd
where with his wife he late had converse held
whom thus the godlike paris first addressd
too long good brother art then here detaind
impatient for the fight by my delay
nor have i timely as thou badst me come
to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
my gallant brother none who thinks aright
can cavil at thy prowess in the field
for thou art very valiant but thy will
is weak and sluggish and it grieves my heart
when from the trojans who in thy behalf
such labours undergo i hear thy name
coupled with foul reproach but go we now
henceforth shall all be well if jove permit
that from our shores we drive th invading greeks
and to the everliving gods of heavn
in peaceful homes our free libations pour





thus as he spoke from out the city gates
the noble hector passd and by his side
his brother paris in the breast of both
burnt the fierce ardour of the battlefield
as when some god a favring breeze bestows
on seamen tugging at the wellworn oar
faint with excess of toil evn so appeard
those brethren twain to troys oerlabourd host

then to their prowess fell by paris hand
menesthius royal areithous son
whom to the king in arna where he dwelt
the stageyd dame phylomedusa bore
while hector smote with welldirected spear
beneath the brassbound headpiece through the throat
eioneus and slackd his limbs in death
and glaucus leader of the lycian bands
son of hippolochus amid the fray
iphinous son of dexias borne on high
by two fleet mares upon a lofty car
piercd through the shoulder from the car he fell
prone to the earth his limbs relaxd in death
but them when pallas saw amid the fray
dealing destruction on the hosts of greece
from high olympus to the walls of troy
she came in haste apollo there she found
as down he lookd from iliums topmost towr
devising victry to the arms of troy
beside the oak they met apollo first
the son of jove the colloquy began
daughter of jove from great olympus heights
why comst thou here by angry passion led
wouldst thou the victry swaying here and there
give to the greeks since pitiless thou seest
the trojans slaughterd be advisd by me
for so twere better cause we for today
the rage of battle and of war to cease
tomorrow morn shall see the fight renewd
until the close of iliums destiny
for so ye goddesses have wrought your will
that this fair city should in ruin fall

to whom the blueeyd goddess thus replied
so be it archerking with like intent
i from olympus came but say what means
wilt thou devise to bid the conflict cease

to whom apollo royal son of jove
the might of valiant hector let us move
to challenge to the combat man to man
some grecian warrior while the brassclad greeks
their champion urge the challenge to accept
and godlike hector meet in single fight

he said nor did minerva not assent
but helenus the son of priam knew
the secret counsel by the gods devisd
and drawing near to hector thus he spoke
hector thou son of priam sage as jove
in council hearken to a brothers words
bid that the greeks and trojans all sit down
and thou defy the boldest of the greeks
with thee in single combat to contend
by revelation from th eternal gods
i know that here thou shalt not meet thy fate

he said and hector joyd to hear his words
forth in the midst he steppd and with his spear
graspd in the middle stayd the trojan ranks
with one accord they sat on th other side
atrides bade the wellgreavd greeks sit down
while in the likeness of two vultures sat
on the tall oak of aegisbearing jove
pallas and phoebus of the silver bow
with heroes deeds delighted dense around
bristled the ranks with shield and helm and spear
as when the west wind freshly blows and brings
a darkning ripple oer the ocean waves
een so appeard upon the plain the ranks
of greeks and trojans standing in the midst
thus to both armies noble hector spoke
hear all ye trojans and ye wellgreavd greeks
the words i speak the promptings of my soul
it hath not pleasd highthrond saturnian jove
to ratify our truce who both afflicts
with labours hard till either ye shall take
our wellfencd city or yourselves to us
succumb beside your oceangoing ships
here have ye all the chiefest men of greece
of all let him who dares with me to fight
stand forth and godlike hectors might confront
and this i say and call to witness jove
if with the sharpedgd spear he vanquish me
he shall strip off and to the hollow ships
in triumph bear my armour but my corpse
restore that so the men and wives of troy
may deck with honours due my funeral pyre
but by apollos grace should i prevail
i will his arms strip off and bear to troy
and in apollos temple hang on high
but to the ships his corpse i will restore
that so the longhaird greeks with solemn rites
may bury him and to his memry raise
by the broad hellespont a lofty tomb
and men in days to come shall say who urge
their fulloard bark across the darkblue sea
lo there a warriors tomb of days gone by
a mighty chief whom glorious hector slew
thus shall they say and thus my fame shall live

thus hector spoke they all in silence heard
shamd to refuse but fearful to accept
at length in anger menelaus rose
groaning in spirit and with bitter words
reproachd them shame ye braggart cowards shame
women of greece i cannot call you men
twere foul disgrace indeed and scorn on scorn
if hectors challenge none of all the greeks
should dare accept to dust and water turn
all ye who here inglorious heartless sit
i will myself confront him for success
th immortal gods above the issues hold

thus as he spoke he donnd his dazzling arms
then menelaus had thine end approachd
by hectors hands so much the stronger he
had not the kings withheld thee and restraind
great agamemnons self wideruling king
seizing his hand addressd him thus by name
what heavnborn menelaus art thou mad
beseems thee not such folly curb thy wrath
though vexd nor think with hector to contend
thy better far inspiring dread in all
from his encounter in the glorious fight
superior far to thee achilles shrinks
but thou amid thy comrades ranks retire
some other champion will the greeks provide
and fearless as he is and of the fight
insatiate yet will hector should he scape
unwounded from the deadly battlestrife
be fain methinks to rest his weary limbs

he said and with judicious counsel swayd
his brothers mind he yielded to his words
and gladly his attendants doffd his arms

then nestor rose and thus addressd the greeks
alas alas what shame is this for greece
what grief would fill the aged peleus soul
sage chief in council of the myrmidons
leader approvd who often in his house
would question me and lovd from me to hear
of all the greeks the race and pedigree
could he but learn how hector cowd them all
he to the gods with hands upraisd would pray
his soul might from his body be divorcd
and sink beneath the earth oh would to jove
to pallas and apollo such were now
my vigrous youth as when beside the banks
of swiftlyflowing celadon the men
of pylos with th arcadian spearmen fought
by pheias walls around iardans streams
then from the ranks in likeness as a god
advancd their champion ereuthalion bold
the arms of areithous he wore
of godlike areithous whom men
and richlygirdled women had surnamd
the macebearer for not with sword or bow
he went to fight but with an iron mace
broke through the squadrons him lycurgus slew
by stealth not bravry in a narrow way
where nought availd his iron mace from death
to save him for lycurgus with his spear
preventing thrust him through the midst he fell
prostrate and from his breast the victor strippd
his armour off the gift of brassclad mars
and in the tug of war he wore it oft
but when lycurgus felt th approach of age
he to his faithful follower and friend
to ereuthalion gave it therewith armd
he now to combat challengd all the chiefs
none dard accept for fear had fallen on all
then i with dauntless spirit his might opposd
the youngest of them all with him i fought
and pallas gave the victry to my arm
him there i slew the tallest strongest man
for many another there beside him lay
would that my youth and strength were now the same
then soon should hector of the glancing helm
a willing champion find but ye of greece
the foremost men with hector fear to fight

the old man spoke reproachful at his words
up rose nine warriors far before the rest
the monarch agamemnon king of men
next tydeus son the valiant diomed
the two ajaces clothd with courage high
idomeneus and of idomeneus
the faithful follower brave meriones
equal in fight to bloodstaind mars with these
eurypylus euaemons noble son
thoas andraemons son ulysses last
these all with hector offerd to contend
then thus again gerenian nestor spoke
shake then the lots on whomsoeer it fall
great profit shall he bring to grecian arms
great glory to himself if he escape
unwounded from the deadly battle strife
he said each markd his sevral lot and all
together threw in agamemnons helm
the crowd with hands uplifted prayd the gods
and looking heavnward said grant father jove
the lot on ajax or on tydeus son
or on mycenæs wealthy king may fall

thus they then aged nestor shook the helm
and forth according to their wish was thrown
the lot of ajax then from left to right
a herald showd to all the chiefs of greece
in turn the token they who knew it not
disclaimd it all but when to him he came
who markd and threw it in atrides helm
the noble ajax and approaching placed
the token in his outstretchd hand forthwith
he knew it and rejoicd before his feet
he threw it down upon the ground and said
o friends the lot is mine great is my joy
and hope oer godlike hector to prevail
but now while i my warlike armour don
pray ye to saturns royal son apart
in silence that the trojans hear ye not
or evn aloud for nought have we to fear
no man against my will can make me fly
by greater force or skill nor will i hope
my inexperience in the field disgrace
the teaching of my native salamis

thus he and they to saturns royal son
addressd their prayrs and looking heavnward said
o father jove who rulst on idas height
most great most glorious grant that ajax now
may gain the victry and immortal praise
or if thy love and pity hector claim
give equal powr and equal praise to both

ajax meanwhile in dazzling brass was clad
and when his armour all was duly donnd
forward he movd as when gigantic mars
leads nations forth to war whom saturns son
in lifedestroying conflict hath involvd
so movd the giant ajax prop of greece
with sternly smiling mien with haughty stride
he trod the plain and poisd his pondrous spear
the greeks rejoicing on their champion gazd
the trojans limbs beneath them shook with fear
evn hectors heart beat quicker in his breast
yet quail he must not now nor back retreat
amid his comradeshe the challenger
ajax approachd before him as a towr
his mighty shield he bore sevnfold brassbound
the work of tychius best artificer
that wrought in leather he in hyla dwelt
of sevnfold hides the pondrous shield was wrought
of lusty bulls the eighth was glittring brass
this by the son of telamon was borne
before his breast to hector close he came
and thus with words of haughty menace spoke

hector i now shall teach thee man to man
the mettle of the chiefs we yet possess
although achilles of the lion heart
mighty in battle be not with us still
he by his oceangoing ships indeed
against atrides nurses still his wrath
yet are there those who dare encounter thee
and not a few then now begin the fight

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
ajax brave leader son of telamon
deal not with me as with a feeble child
or woman ignrant of the ways of war
of war and carnage every point i know
and well i know to wield now right now left
the tough bullshide that forms my stubborn targe
well know i too my fiery steeds to urge
and raise the warcry in the standing fight
but not in secret ambush would i watch
to strike by stealth a noble foe like thee
but slay thee if i may in open fight

he said and poising hurld his pondrous spear
the brazen covring of the shield it struck
the outward fold the eighth above the sevn
of tough bullshide through six it drove its way
with stubborn force but in the seventh was stayd
then ajax hurld in turn his pondrous spear
and struck the circle true of hectors shield
right thro the glittring shield the stout spear passd
and thro the wellwrought breastplate drove its way
and underneath the linen vest it tore
but hector stooping shunnd the stroke of death
withdrawing then their weapons each on each
they fell like lions fierce or tusked boars
in strength the mightiest of the forest beasts
then hector fairly on the centre struck
the stubborn shield yet drove not through the spear
for the stout brass the blunted point repelld
but ajax with a forward bound the shield
of hector piercd right through the weapon passd
arrested with rude shock the warriors course
and grazd his neck that spouted forth the blood
yet did not hector of the glancing helm
flinch from the contest stooping to the ground
with his broad hand a pondrous stone he seizd
that lay upon the plain dark jaggd and huge
and hurld against the sevnfold shield and struck
full on the central boss loud rang the brass
then ajax raisd a weightier mass of rock
and sent it whirling giving to his arm
unmeasurd impulse with a millstones weight
it crushd the buckler hectors knees gave way
backward he staggerd yet upon his shield
sustaind till phoebus raisd him to his feet
now had they hand to hand with swords engagd
had not the messengers of gods and men
the heralds interposd the one for troy
the other umpire for the brassclad greeks
talthybius and idaeus well approvd
between the chiefs they held their wands and thus
idaeus both with prudent speech addressd
no more brave youths no longer wage the fight
to cloudcompelling jove ye both are dear
both valiant spearmen that we all have seen
night is at hand behoves us yield to night

whom answerd thus the son of telamon
idaeus bid that hector speak those words
he challengd all our chiefs let him begin
if he be willing i shall not refuse

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
ajax since god hath givn thee size and strength
and skill and with the spear of all the greeks
none is thine equal cease we for today
the fight hereafter we may meet and heavn
decide our cause and one with victry crown
night is at hand behoves us yield to night
so by the ships shalt thou rejoice the greeks
and most of all thy comrades and thy friends
and so shall i in priams royal town
rejoice the men of troy and longrobd dames
who shall with grateful prayrs the temples throng
but make we now an interchange of gifts
that both the trojans and the greeks may say
on mortal quarrel did those warriors meet
yet parted thence in friendly bonds conjoind

this said a silverstudded sword he gave
with scabbard and with wellcut belt complete
ajax a girdle rich with crimson dye
they parted ajax to the grecian camp
and hector to the ranks of troy returnd
great was the joy when him they saw approach
alive and safe escapd from ajax might
and arm invincible and towrd the town
they led him back beyond their hope preservd
while to atrides tent the wellgreavd greeks
led ajax glorying in his triumph gaind

but when to agamemnons tents they came
the king of men to saturns royal son
a bullock slew a male of five years old
the carcase then they flayd and cutting up
severd the joints then fixing on the spits
roasted with care and from the fire withdrew
their labours ended and the feast prepard
they shard the social meal nor lackd there aught
to ajax then the chines continuous length
as honours meed the mighty monarch gave
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
the aged nestor first his mind disclosd
he who before the sagest counsel gave
now thus with prudent speech began and said
atrides and ye other chiefs of greece
since many a longhaird greek hath falln in fight
whose blood beside scamanders flowing stream
fierce mars has shed while to the viewless shades
their spirits are gone behoves thee with the morn
the warfare of the greeks to intermit
then we with oxen and with mules the dead
from all the plain will draw and from the ships
a little space removd will burn with fire
that we returning to our native land
may to their children bear our comrades bones
then will we go and on the plain erect
around the pyre one common mound for all
then quickly build before it lofty towrs
to screen both ships and men and in the towrs
make ample portals with wellfitting gates
that through the midst a carriageway may pass
and a deep trench around it dig to guard
both men and chariots lest on our defence
the haughty trojans should too hardly press

he said and all the kings his words approvd
meanwhile on iliums height at priams gate
the trojan chiefs a troubled council held
which opning thus the sage antenor spoke
hear now ye trojans dardans and allies
the words i speak the promptings of my soul
back to the sons of atreus let us give
the argive helen and the goods she brought
for now in breach of plighted faith we fight
nor can i hope unless to my advice
ye listen that success will crown our arms
thus having said he sat and next arose
the godlike paris fairhaird helens lord
who thus with winged words the chiefs addressd
hostile to me antenor is thy speech
thy better judgment better counsel knows
but if in earnest such is thine advice
thee of thy senses have the gods bereft
now trojans hear my answer i reject
the counsel nor the woman will restore
but for the goods whateer i hither brought
to troy from argos i am well content
to give them all and others add beside

this said he sat and aged priam next
a god in council dardans son arose
who thus with prudent speech began and said

hear now ye trojans dardans and allies
the words i speak the promptings of my soul
now through the city take your wonted meal
look to your watch let each man keep his guard
tomorrow shall idaeus to the ships
of greece to both the sons of atreus bear
the words of paris cause of all this war
and ask besides if from the deadly strife
such truce they will accord us as may serve
to burn the dead hereafter we may fight
till heavn decide and one with victry crown

he said and they obedient to his word
throughout the ranks prepard the wonted meal
but with the morning to the ships of greece
idaeus took his way in council there
by agamemnons leading ship he found
the grecian chiefs the ministers of mars
and mid them all the clearvoicd herald spoke

ye sons of atreus and ye chiefs of greece
from priam and the gallant sons of troy
i come to bear if ye be pleasd to hear
the words of paris cause of all this war
the goods which hither in his hollow ships
 paris brought
he will restore and others add beside
but further says the virginwedded wife
of menelaus though the genral voice
of troy should bid him he will not restore
then bids me ask if from the deadly strife
such truce ye will accord us as may serve
to burn the dead hereafter we may fight
till heavn decide and one with victry crown

thus he they all in silence heard at length
uprose the valiant diomed and said
let none from paris now propose to accept
or goods or helens self a child may see
that now the doom of troy is close at hand
he said the sons of greece with loud applause
the speech of valiant diomed confirmd

then to idaeus agamemnon thus
idaeus thou hast heard what answer give
the chiefs of greecetheir answer i approve
but for the truce for burial of the dead
i nought demur no shame it is to grace
with funral rites the corpse of slaughterd foes
be witness jove and guard the plighted truce

he said and heavnward raisd his staff and back
to iliums walls idaeus took his way
trojans and dardans there in council met
expecting sat till from the grecian camp
idaeus should return he came and stood
in mid assembly and his message gave
then all in haste their sevral ways dispersd
for fuel some and some to bring the dead
the greeks too from their wellmannd ships went forth
for fuel some and some to bring the dead
the sun was newly glancing on the earth
from out the oceans smoothlyflowing depths
climbing the heavns when on the plain they met
hard was it then to recognize the dead
but when the gory dust was washd away
shedding hot tears they placd them on the wains
nor loud lament by priams high command
was heard in silence they with grief suppressd
heapd up their dead upon the funral pyre
then burnt with fire and back returnd to troy
the wellgreavd greeks they too with grief suppressd
heapd up their dead upon the funral pyre
then burnt with fire and to the ships returnd

but ere twas morn while daylight strove with night
about the pyre a chosen band of greeks
had kept their vigil and around it raisd
upon the plain one common mound for all
and built in front a wall with lofty towrs
to screen both ships and men and in the towrs
made ample portals with wellfitting gates
that through the midst a carriageway might pass
then dug a trench around it deep and wide
and in the trench a palisade they fixd

thus labourd thro the night the longhaird greeks
the gods assembled in the courts of jove
with wonder viewd the mighty work and thus
neptune earthshaking king his speech began
o father jove in all the widespread earth
shall men be found in counsel and design
to rival us immortals seest thou not
how round their ships the longhaird greeks have built
a lofty wall and dug a trench around
nor to the gods have paid their offrings due
wide as the light extends shall be the fame
of this great work and men shall lightly deem
of that which i and phoebus jointly raisd
with toil and pain for great laomedon

to whom in wrath the cloudcompeller thus
neptune earthshaking king what words are these
this bold design to others of the gods
of feebler hands and powr less great than thine
might cause alarm but far as light extends
of this great work to thee shall be the fame
when with their ships the longhaird greeks shall take
their homeward voyage to their native land
this wall shall by the waves be broken through
and sink a shapeless ruin in the sea
oer the wide shore again thy sands shall spread
and all the boasted work of greece oerwhelm

amid themselves such converse held the gods
the sun was set the grecian work was done
they slew and shard by tents the evning meal
from lemnos isle a numrous fleet had come
freighted with wine and by euneus sent
whom fair hypsipyle to jason bore
for atreus sons apart from all the rest
of wine the son of jason had despatchd
a thousand measures all the other greeks
hastend to purchase some with brass and some
with gleaming iron other some with hides
cattle or slaves and joyous waxd the feast
all night the longhaird greeks their revels held
and so in troy the trojans and allies
but through the night his anger jove expressd
with awful thunderings pale they turnd with fear
to earth the wine was from the goblets shed
nor dard they drink until libations due
had first been pourd to saturns mighty son

then lay they down and sought the boon of sleep




now morn in saffron robe the earth oerspread
and jove the lightnings lord of all the gods
a council held upon the highest peak
of manyridgd olympus he himself
addressd them they his speech attentive heard

hear all ye gods and all ye goddesses
the words i speak the promptings of my soul
let none among you male or female dare
to thwart my counsels rather all concur
that so these matters i may soon conclude
if from the rest apart one god i find
presuming or to trojans or to greeks
to give his aid with ignominious stripes
back to olympus shall that god be drivn
or to the gloom of tartarus profound
far off the lowest abyss beneath the earth
with gates of iron and with floor of brass
beneath the shades as far as earth from heavn
there will i hurl him and ye all shall know
in strength how greatly i surpass you all
make trial if ye will that all may know
a golden cord let down from heavn and all
both gods and goddesses your strength apply
yet would ye fail to drag from heavn to earth
strive as ye may your mighty master jove
but if i choose to make my powr be known
the earth itself and ocean i could raise
and binding round olympus ridge the cord
leave them suspended so in middle air
so far supreme my powr oer gods and men

he said and they confounded by his words
in silence sat so sternly did he speak
at length the blueeyd goddess pallas said
o father son of saturn king of kings
well do we know thy powr invincible
yet deeply grieve we for the warlike greeks
condemnd to hopeless ruin from the fight
since such is thy command we stand aloof
but yet some saving counsel may we give
lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite

to whom the cloudcompeller smiling thus
be of good cheer my child unwillingly
i speak yet will not thwart thee of thy wish

he said and straight the brazenfooted steeds
of swiftest flight with manes of flowing gold
he harnessd to his chariot all in gold
himself arrayd the golden lash he graspd
of curious work and mounting on his car
urgd the fleet coursers nothing loth they flew
midway betwixt the earth and starry heavn
to idas springabounding hill he came
and to the crest of gargarus wild nurse
of mountain beasts a sacred plot was there
whereon his incensehonourd altar stood
there stayd his steeds the sire of gods and men
loosd from the car and veild with clouds around
then on the topmost ridge he sat in pride
of conscious strength and looking down surveyd
the trojan city and the ships of greece

meantime the greeks throughout their tents in haste
despatchd their meal and armd them for the fight
on th other side the trojans donnd their arms
in numbers fewer but with stern resolve
by hard necessity constraind to strive
for wives and children in the stubborn fight
the gates all opend wide forth pourd the crowd
of horse and foot and loud the clamour rose
when in the midst they met together rushd
bucklers and lances and the furious might
of mailclad warriors bossy shield on shield
clatterd in conflict loud the clamour rose
then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
slaying and slain the earth ran red with blood
while yet twas morn and waxd the youthful day
thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell
on either side but when the sun had reachd
the middle heavn th eternal father hung
his golden scales aloft and placd in each
the fatal deathlot for the sons of troy
the one the other for the brassclad greeks
then held them by the midst down sank the lot
of greece down to the ground while high aloft
mounted the trojan scale and rose to heavn
then loud he bade the volleying thunder peal
from idas heights and mid the grecian ranks
he hurld his flashing lightning at the sight
amazd they stood and pale with terror shook

then not idomeneus nor atreus son
the mighty agamemnon kept their ground
nor either ajax ministers of mars
gerenian nestor aged prop of greece
alone remaind and he against his will
his horse sore wounded by an arrow shot
by godlike paris fairhaird helens lord
just on the crown where close behind the head
first springs the mane the deadliest spot of all
the arrow struck him maddend with the pain
he reard then plunging forward with the shaft
fixd in his brain and rolling in the dust
the other steeds in dire confusion threw
and while old nestor with his sword essayd
to cut the reins and free the struggling horse
amid the rout down came the flying steeds
of hector guided by no timid hand
by hectors self then had the old man paid
the forfeit of his life but good at need
the valiant diomed his peril saw
and loudly shouting on ulysses calld
ulysses sage laertes godlike son
why fliest thou cowardlike amid the throng
and in thy flight to the aim of hostile spears
thy back presenting stay and here with me
from this fierce warrior guard the good old man

he said but stout ulysses heard him not
and to the ships pursued his hurried way
but in the front tydides though alone
remaind undaunted by old nestors car
he stood and thus the aged chief addressd
old man these youthful warriors press thee sore
thy vigour spent and with the weight of years
oppressd and helpless too thy charioteer
and slow thy horses mount my car and prove
how swift my steeds or in pursuit or flight
from those of tros descended scour the plain
my noble prize from great æneas won
leave to th attendants these while mine we launch
against the trojan host that hectors self
may know how strong my hand can hurl the spear

he said and nestor his advice obeyd
the two attendants valiant sthenelus
and good eurymedon his horses took
while on tydides car they mounted both
the aged nestor took the glittring reins
and urgd the horses hector soon they met
as on he came his spear tydides threw
yet struck not hector but his charioteer
who held the reins the brave thebaeus son
eniopeus through the breast transfixd
beside the nipple from the car he fell
the startled horses swerving at the sound
and from his limbs the vital spirit fled
deep for his comrade slain was hectors grief
yet him though grievd perforce he left to seek
a charioteer nor wanted long his steeds
a guiding hand for archeptolemus
brave son of iphitus he quickly found
and bade him mount his swiftlyflying car
and to his hands the glittring reins transferrd

then fearful ruin had been wrought and deeds
untold achievd and like a flock of lambs
the adverse hosts been coopd beneath the walls
had not the sire of gods and men beheld
and with an awful peal of thunder hurld
his vivid lightning down the fiery bolt
before tydides chariot ploughd the ground
fierce flashd the sulphrous flame and whirling round
beneath the yoke th affrighted horses quailed

from nestors hand escapd the glittring reins
and trembling thus to diomed he spoke

turn we to flight tydides seest thou not
that jove from us his aiding hand withholds
this day to hector saturns son decrees
the meed of victry on some future day
if so he will the triumph may be ours
for man how brave soeer cannot oerrule
the will of jove so much the mightier he

whom answerd thus the valiant diomed
truly old man and wisely dost thou speak
but this the bitter grief that wrings my soul
some day amid the councillors of troy
hector may say before my presence scard
tydides sought the shelter of the ships
thus when he boasts gape earth and hide my shame

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
great son of tydeus oh what words are these
should hector brand thee with a cowards name
no credence would he gain from trojan men
or dardan or from trojan warriors wives
whose husbands in the dust thy hand hath laid

he said and mid the general rout to flight
he turnd his horses on the flying crowd
with shouts of triumph hector at their head
the men of troy their murdrous weapons showrd
loud shouted hector of the glancing helm
tydides heretofore the warrior greeks
have held thee in much honour placd on high
at banquets and with libral portions gracd
and flowing cups but thou from this day forth
shalt be their scorn a womans soul is thine
out on thee frightend girl thou neer shalt scale
our trojan towrs and see me basely fly
nor in thy ships our women bear away
ere such thy boast my hand shall work thy doom

thus he and greatly was tydides movd
to turn his horses and confront his foe
thrice thus he doubted thrice at joves command
from idas height the thunder peald in sign
of victry swaying to the trojan side
then to the trojans hector calld aloud
trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter quit ye now like men
put forth your wonted valour for i know
that in his secret counsels jove designs
glory to me disaster to the greeks
fools in those wretched walls that put their trust
scarce worthy notice hopeless to withstand
my onset and the trench that they have dug
our horses easily can overleap
and when i reach the ships be mindful ye
to have at hand the fire wherewith the ships
we may destroy while they themselves shall fall
an easy prey bewilderd by the smoke

he said and thus with cheering words addressd
his horses xanthus and podargus thou
æthon and lampus now repay the care
on you bestowd by fair andromache
eetions royal daughter bear in mind
how she with ample store of provender
your mangers still supplied before een i
her husband from her hands the winecup took
put forth your speed that we may make our prize
of nestors shield whose praise extends to heavn
its handles and itself of solid gold
and from the shoulders of tydides strip
his gorgeous breastplate work of vulcans hand
these could we take methinks this very night
would see the greeks embarking on their ships

such was his prayr but juno on her throne
trembled with rage till great olympus quakd
and thus to neptune mighty god she spoke
o thou of boundless might earthshaking god
seest thou unmovd the ruin of the greeks
yet they in ægae and in helice
with grateful offrings rich thine altars crown
then give we them the victry if we all
who favour greece together should combine
to put to flight the trojans and restrain
allseeing jove he might be left alone
on idas summit to digest his wrath

to whom in anger neptune thus replied
o juno rash of speech what words are these
i dare not counsel that we all should join
gainst saturns son so much the stronger he

such converse held they all the space meanwhile
within the trench between the towr and ships
was closely throngd with steeds and bucklerd men
by noble hector brave as mars and led
by jove to victry coopd in narrow space
who now had burnt with fire the grecian ships
but juno bade atrides haste to rouse
their fainting courage through the camp he passd
on his broad hand a purple robe he bore
and stood upon ulysses lofty ship
the midmost whence to shout to either side
or to the tents of ajax telamon
or of achilles who at each extreme
confiding in their strength had moord their ships

thence to the greeks he shouted loud and clear
shame on ye greeks base cowards brave alone
in outward semblance where are now the vaunts
which once 
ye made vainglorious braggarts as ye were
in lemnos isle when feasting on the flesh
of straighthornd oxen and your flowing cups
crowning with ruddy wine not one of you
but for a hundred trojans in the field
or for two hundred deemd himself a match
now quail ye all before a single man
hector who soon will wrap our ships in fire
o father jove what sovreign eer hast thou
so far deluded of such glory robbd
yet neer on this disastrous voyage bent
have i unheeded passd thine altar by
the choicest offrings burning still on each
in hopes to raze the wellbuilt walls of troy
yet to this prayr at least thine ear incline
grant that this coast in safety we may leave
nor be by trojans utterly subdued

he said and jove with pity saw his tears
and with a sign his peoples safety vouchd
he sent an eagle noblest bird that flies
who in his talons bore a wild deers fawn
the fawn he droppd beside the holy shrine
where to the lord of divination jove
the greeks were wont their solemn rites to pay
the sign from heavn they knew with courage fresh
assaild the trojans and the fight renewd
then none of all the many greeks might boast
that he before tydides drove his car
across the ditch and mingled in the fight
his was the hand that first a crested chief
the son of phradmon agelaus struck
he turnd his car for flight but as he turnd
the lance of diomed behind his neck
between the shoulders through his chest was drivn
headlong he fell and loud his armour rang

next to tydides agamemnon came
and menelaus atreus godlike sons
th ajaces both in dauntless courage clothd
idomeneus with whom meriones
his faithful comrade terrible as mars
eurypylus euaemons noble son
the ninth was teucer who with bended bow
behind the shield of ajax telamon
took shelter ajax oer him held his shield
thence lookd he round and aimd amid the crowd
and as he saw each trojan wounded fall
struck by his shafts to ajax close he pressd
as to its mothers sheltring arms a child
conceald and safe beneath the ample targe

say then who first of all the trojans fell
by teucers arrows slain orsilochus
and ophelestes daetor ormenus
and godlike lycophontes chromius
and amopaon polyaemons son
and valiant melanippus all of these
each after other teucer laid in dust
him agamemnon with his wellstrung bow
thinning the trojan ranks with joy beheld
and standing at his side addressd him thus
teucer good comrade son of telamon
shoot ever thus if thou wouldst be the light
and glory of the greeks and of thy sire
who nursed thine infancy and in his house
maintaind though bastard him though distant far
to highest fame let thine achievements raise
this too i say and will make good my word
if by the grace of aegisbearing jove
and pallas iliums wellbuilt walls we raze
a gift of honour second but to mine
i in thy hands will place a tripod bright
or with their car and harness two brave steeds
or a fair woman who thy bed may share

to whom in answer valiant teucer thus
most mighty son of atreus why excite
who lacks not zeal to th utmost of my powr
since first we drove the trojans back i watch
unceasing every chance to ply my shafts
eight barbed arrows have i shot een now
and in a warrior each has found its mark
that savage hound alone defeats my aim

at hector as he spoke another shaft
he shot ambitious of so great a prize
he missd his aim but priams noble son
gorgythion through the breast his arrow struck
whom from æsyme brought a wedded bride
of heavenly beauty castianeira bore
down sank his head as in a garden sinks
a ripend poppy chargd with vernal rains
so sank his head beneath his helmets weight
at hector yet another arrow shot
teucer ambitious of so great a prize
yet this too missd by phoebus turnd aside
but archeptolemus the charioteer
of hector onward hurrying through the breast
it struck beside the nipple from the car
he fell aside the startled horses swervd
and as he fell the vital spirit fled
deep for his comrade slain was hectors grief
yet him though grievd at heart perforce he left
and to cebriones his brother calld
then near at hand the horses reins to take
he heard and straight obeyd then hector leapd
down from his glittring chariot to the ground
his fearful warcry shouting in his hand
a pondrous stone he carried and intent
to strike him down at teucer straight he rushd
he from his quiver chose a shaft in haste
and fitted to the cord but as he drew
the sinew hector of the glancing helm
hurld the huge mass of rock which teucer struck
near to the shoulder where the collarbone
joins neck and breast the spot most opportune
and broke the tendon paralysd his arm
droppd helpless by his side upon his knees
he fell and from his hands let fall the bow
not careless ajax saw his brothers fall
but oer him spread in haste his covring shield
two faithful friends mecisteus echius son
and brave alastor from the press withdrew
and bore him deeply groaning to the ships

then jove again the trojan courage fird
and backward to the ditch they forcd the greeks
proud of his prowess hector led them on
and as a hound that fleet of foot oertakes
or boar or lion object of his chase
springs from behind and fastens on his flank
yet careful watches lest he turn to bay
so hector pressd upon the longhaird greeks
slaying the hindmost they in terror fled
but passd at length the ditch and palisade
with loss of many by the trojans slain
before the ships they rallied from their flight
and one to other calld and one and all
with hands uplifted prayd to all the gods
while hector here and there on evry side
his flying coursers wheeld with eyes that flashd
awful as gorgons or as bloodstaind mars

juno the whitearmd queen with pity movd
to pallas thus her winged words addressd
o heavn brave child of aegisbearing jove
can we evn now in this their sorest need
refuse the greeks our aid by one subdued
one single man of pride unbearable
hector the son of priam who een now
hath causd them endless grief to whom again
the blueeyd goddess pallas thus replied
i too would fain behold him robbd of life
in his own country slain by grecian hands
but that my sire by ill advice misled
rages in wrath still thwarting all my plans
forgetting now how oft his son i savd
sore wearied with the toils eurystheus gave
oft would his tears ascend to heavn and oft
from heavn would jove despatch me to his aid
but if i then had known what now i know
when to the narrow gates of plutos realm
he sent him forth to bring from erebus
its guardian dog he never had returnd
in safety from the marge of styx profound
he holds me now in hatred and his ear
to thetis lends who kissd his knees and touchd
his beard and prayd him to avenge her son
achilles yet the time shall come when i
shall be once more his own dear blueeyd maid
but haste thee now prepare for us thy car
while to the house of aegisbearing jove
i go and don my armour for the fight
to prove if hector of the glancing helm
the son of priam will unmovd behold
us two advancing oer the pass of war
or if the flesh of trojans slain by greeks
shall sate the maw of ravning dogs and birds

she said the whitearmd queen her word obeyd
juno great goddess royal saturns child
the horses brought with golden frontlets crownd
while pallas child of aegisbearing jove
within her fathers threshold droppd her veil
of airy texture work of her own hands
the cuirass donnd of cloudcompelling jove
and stood accoutred for the bloody fray
the fiery car she mounted in her hand
a spear she bore long weighty tough wherewith
the mighty daughter of a mighty sire
sweeps down the ranks of those her wrath pursues
then juno sharply touchd the flying steeds
forthwith spontaneous opening grated harsh
the heavenly portals guarded by the hours
who heavn and high olympus have in charge
to roll aside or close the veil of cloud
through these th excited horses held their way

from idas heights the son of saturn saw
and filld with wrath the heavnly messenger
the goldenwinged iris thus bespoke
haste thee swift iris turn them back and warn
that farther they advance not tis not meet
that they and i in war should be opposd
this too i say and will make good my words
their flying horses i will lame themselves
dash from their car and break their chariotwheels
and ten revolving years heal not the wound
where strikes my lightning so shall pallas learn
what tis against her father to contend
juno less moves my wonder and my wrath
whateer i plan tis still her wont to thwart
thus he from ida to olympus height
the stormswift iris on her errand sped
at manyridgd olympus outer gate
she met the goddesses and stayd their course
and thus conveyd the sovreign will of jove

whither away what madness fills your breasts
to give the greeks your succour jove forbids
and thus he threatens and will make it good
your flying horses he will lame yourselves
dash from the car and break your chariotwheels
and ten revolving years heal not the wounds
his lightning makes so pallas shalt thou learn
what tis against thy father to contend
juno less moves his wonder and his wrath
whateer he plans tis still her wont to thwart
but overbold and void of shame art thou
if against jove thou dare to lift thy spear

thus as she spoke swift iris disappeard
then juno thus to pallas spoke no more
daughter of aegisbearing jove can we
for mortal men his sovreign will resist
live they or die as each mans fate may be
while he twixt greeks and trojans as tis meet
his own designs accomplishing decides
she said and backward turnd her horses heads
the horses from the car the hours unyokd
and safely tetherd in the heavnly stalls
the car they reard against the inner wall
that brightly polishd shone the goddesses
themselves meanwhile amid th immortals all
with sorrowing hearts on golden seats reclind

ere long on swiftlyrolling chariot borne
jove to olympus to th abode of gods
from idas height returnd th earthshaking god
neptune unyokd his steeds and on the stand
securd the car and spread the covring oer
then on his golden throne allseeing jove
sat down beneath his feet olympus shook
juno and pallas only sat aloof
no word they utterd no enquiry made
jove knew their thoughts and thus addressd them both
pallas and juno wherefore sit ye thus
in angry silence in the glorious fight
no lengthend toil have ye sustaind to slay
the trojans whom your deadly hate pursues
not all the gods that on olympus dwell
could turn me from my purpose such my might
and such the powr of my resistless hand
but ye were struck with terror ere ye saw
the battlefield and fearful deeds of war
but this i say and bear it in your minds
had i my lightning launchd and from your car
had hurld ye down ye neer had reachd again
olympus height th immortal gods abode

so spoke the god but seated side by side
juno and pallas glances interchangd
of ill portent for troy pallas indeed
sat silent and though inly wroth with jove
yet answerd not a word but junos breast
could not contain her rage and thus she spoke
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
well do we know thy powr invincible
yet deeply grieve we for the warlike greeks
condemnd to hopeless ruin from the fight
since such is thy command we stand aloof
but yet some saving counsel may we give
lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite

to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
yet greater slaughter stageyd queen of heavn
tomorrow shalt thou see if so thou list
wrought on the warrior greeks by saturns son
for hectors proud career shall not be checkd
until the wrath of peleus godlike son
beside the ships be kindled in the day
when round patroclus corpse in narrow space
een by the vessels sterns the war shall rage
such is the voice of destiny for thee
i reck not of thy wrath nor should i care
though thou wert thrust beneath the lowest deep
of earth and ocean where iapetus
and saturn lie uncheerd by ray of sun
or breath of air in tartarus profound
though there thou wert to banishment consignd
i should not heed but thy reproaches hear
unmovd for viler thing is none than thou
he said but whitearmd juno answerd not

the sun now sunk beneath the ocean wave
drew oer the teeming earth the veil of night
the trojans saw reluctant days decline
but on the greeks thrice welcome thrice invoked
with earnest prayers the shades of darkness fell

the noble hector then to council calld
the trojan leaders from the ships apart
he led them by the eddying rivers side
to a clear space of ground from corpses free
they from their cars dismounting to the words
of godlike hector listend in his hand
his massive spear he held twelve cubits long
whose glittring point flashd bright with hoop of gold
encircled round on this he leant and said
hear me ye trojans dardans and allies
i hopd that to the breezy heights of troy
we might ere now in triumph have returnd
the grecian ships and all the greeks destroyd
but night hath come too soon and savd awhile
the grecian army and their stranded ships
then yield we to the night prepare the meal
unyoke your horses and before them place
their needful forage from the city bring
oxen and sheep the luscious wine provide
bring bread from out our houses and collect
good store of fuel that the livelong night
een till the dawn of day may broadly blaze
our numrous watchfires and illume the heavns
lest een by night the longhaird greeks should seek
oer the broad bosom of the sea to fly
that so not unassaild they may embark
nor undisturbd but haply some may bear
een to their homes the memry of a wound
receivd from spear or arrow as on board
they leapd in haste and others too may fear
to tempt with hostile arms the powr of troy
then let the sacred heralds voice proclaim
throughout the city that the stripling youths
and hoaryheaded sires allot themselves
in sevral watches to the heavnbuilt towrs
charge too the women in their houses each
to kindle blazing fires let careful watch
be set lest in the absence of the men
the town by secret ambush be surprisd
such valiant trojans is th advice i give
and what tonight your wisdom shall approve
will i at morn before the trojans speak
hopeful to jove i pray and all the gods
to chase from hence these fateinflicted hounds
by fate sent hither on their darkribbd ships
now keep we through the night our watchful guard
and with the early dawn equippd in arms
upon their fleet our angry battle pour
then shall i know if tydeus valiant son
back from the ships shall drive me to the walls
or i triumphant bear his bloody spoils
tomorrow morn his courage will decide
if he indeed my onset will await
but ere tomorrows sun be high in heavn
he mid the foremost if i augur right
wounded and bleeding in the dust shall lie
and many a comrade round him would to heavn
i were as sure to be from age and death
exempt and held in honour as a god
phoebus or pallas as i am assurd
the coming day is fraught with ill to greece

thus hector spoke the trojans shouted loud
then from the yoke the sweating steeds they loosd
and tetherd each beside their sevral cars
next from the city speedily they brought
oxen and sheep the luscious wine procurd
brought bread from out their houses and good store
of fuel gatherd wafted from the plain
the winds to heavn the savry odours bore
full of proud hopes upon the pass of war
all night they campd and frequent blazd their fires

as when in heavn around the glittring moon
the stars shine bright amid the breathless air
and evry crag and evry jutting peak
stands boldly forth and evry forest glade
evn to the gates of heavn is opend wide
the boundless sky shines each particular star
distinct joy fills the gazing shepherds heart
so bright so thickly scatterd oer the plain
before the walls of troy between the ships
and xanthus stream the trojan watchfires blazd

a thousand fires burnt brightly and round each
sat fifty warriors in the ruddy glare
champing the provender before them laid
barley and rye the tetherd horses stood
beside the cars and waited for the morn





thus kept their watch the trojans but the greeks
dire panic held companion of chill fear
their bravest struck with grief unbearable
as when two stormy winds ruffle the sea
boreas and zephyr from the hills of thrace
with sudden gust descending the dark waves
rear high their angry crests and toss on shore
masses of tangled weed such stormy grief
the breast of evry grecian warrior rent

atrides heartstruck wanderd to and fro
and to the clearvoicd heralds gave command
to call but not with proclamation loud
each sevral man to council he himself
spard not his labour mixing with the chiefs
sadly they sat in council atreus son
weeping arose as some darkwaterd fount
pours oer a craggy steep its gloomy stream
then with deep groans th assembled greeks addressd
o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
grievous and all unlookd for is the blow
which jove hath dealt me by his promise led
i hopd to raze the strongbuilt walls of troy
and home return in safety but it seems
he falsifies his word and bids me now
return to argos frustrate of my hope
dishonourd and with grievous loss of men
such now appears th oerruling sovreign will
of saturns son who oft hath sunk the heads
of many a lofty city in the dust
and yet will sink for mighty is his hand
hear then my counsel let us all agree
home to direct our course since here in vain
we strive to take the wellbuilt walls of troy

the monarch spoke they all in silence heard
in speechless sorrow long they sat at length
rose valiant diomed and thus he spoke
atrides i thy folly must confront
as is my right in council thou o king
be not offended once among the greeks
thou heldest light my prowess with the name
of coward branding me how justly so
is known to all the greeks both young and old
on thee the deepdesigning saturns son
in diffring measure hath his gifts bestowd
a throne he gives thee higher far than all
but valour noblest boon of heavn denies
how canst thou hope the sons of greece shall prove
such heartless dastards as thy words suppose
if homeward to return thy mind be fixd
depart the way is open and the ships
which from mycenæ followd thee in crowds
are close at hand and ready to be launchd
yet will the other longhaird greeks remain
till priams city fall nay though the rest
betake them to their ships and sail for home
yet i and sthenelus we two will fight
till troy be ours for heavn is on our side

thus he the sons of greece with loud applause
the speech of valiant diomed confirmd

then aged nestor rose and thus began
tydides eminent thou art in war
and in the council thy compeers in age
must yield to thee thy present words no greek
can censure or gainsay and yet the end
thou hast not reachd and object of debate
but thou art young and for thine age mightst be
my latest born yet dost thou to the kings
sage counsel give and well in season speak
but now will i that am thine elder far
go fully through the whole and none my words
may disregard not evn atrides self
outcast from kindred law and hearth is he
whose soul delights in fierce internal strife
but yield we now to th influence of night
prepare the meal and let the sevral guards
be posted by the ditch without the wall
this duty on the younger men i lay
then agamemnon thou thy part perform
for thou art king supreme the elders all
as meet and seemly to the feast invite
thy tents are full of wine which grecian ships
oer the wide sea bring day by day from thrace
nor lackst thou aught thy guests to entertain
and many own thy sway when all are met
his counsel take who gives the best advice
great need we have of counsel wise and good
when close beside our ships the hostile fires
are burning who can this unmovd behold
this night our ruin or our safety sees

he said and they assenting heard his speech
forth with their followers went th appointed guards
the princely thrasymedes nestors son
ascalaphus and bold ialmenus
two valiant sons of mars meriones
and aphareus and brave deipyrus
and godlike lycomedes creons son
sevn were the leaders and with each went forth
a hundred gallant youths with lances armd
between the ditch and wall they took their post
there lit their fires and there the meal prepard

then for th assembled elders in his tent
an ample banquet agamemnon spread
they on the viands set before them fell
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
the aged nestor first his mind disclosd
he who before the sagest counsel gave
now thus with prudent words began and said

most mighty agamemnon king of men
with thee atrides my discourse shall end
with thee begin oer many nations thou
holdst sovreign sway since jove to thee hath givn
the sceptre and the high prerogative
to be thy peoples judge and counsellor
tis thine to speak the word tis thine to hear
and to determine when some other chief
suggestions offers in the genral cause
what counsel shall prevail depends on thee
yet will i say what seems to me the best
sounder opinion none can hold than this
which i maintain and ever have maintaind
evn from the day when thou great king didst bear
the fair briseis from achilles tent
despite his angernot by my advice
i fain would have dissuaded thee but thou
following the dictates of thy wrathful pride
didst to our bravest wrong dishonring him
whom evn th immortals honourd for his prize
thou tookst and still retainst but let us now
consider if evn yet with costly gifts
and soothing words we may his wrath appease

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
father too truly thou recallst my fault
i errd nor will deny it as a host
is he whom jove in honour holds as now
achilles honring he confounds the greeks
but if i errd by evil impulse led
fain would i now conciliate him and pay
an ample penalty before you all
i pledge myself rich presents to bestow
sevn tripods will i give untouchd by fire
of gold ten talents twenty caldrons bright
twelve powrful horses on the course renownd
who by their speed have many prizes won
not emptyhanded could that man be deemd
nor poor in gold who but so much possessd
as by those horses has for me been won
sevn women too well skilld in household cares
lesbians whom i selected for myself
that day he capturd lesbos goodly isle
in beauty far surpassing all their sex
these will i give and with them will i send
the fair briseis her whom from his tent
i bore away and add a solemn oath
i neer approachd her bed nor held with her
such intercourse as man with woman holds
all these shall now be his but if the gods
shall grant us priams city to destroy
of gold and brass when we divide the spoil
with countless heaps he shall a vessel freight
and twenty captives he himself shall choose
all only less than argive helen fair
and if it be our fate to see again
the teeming soil of argos he shall be
my son by marriage and in honour held
as is orestes who my only son
is reard at home in luxury and ease
three daughters fair i have chrysothemis
iphianassa and laodice
of these whicheer he will to peleus house
no portion askd for he shall take to wife
and with her will i add such wedding gifts
as never man before to daughter gave
sevn prosprous towns besides cardamyle
and enope and iras grassy plains
and pherae and antheias pastures deep
æpeia fair and vineclad pedasus
all by the sea by sandy pylos bounds
the dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich
and as a god shall honour him with gifts
and to his sceptre ample tribute pay
this will i do so he his wrath remit
then let him yield 
to me submitting as in royal powr
superior far and more advancd in age

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
most mighty agamemnon king of men
atrides not unworthy are the gifts
which to achilles thou designst to send
then to the tent of peleus son in haste
let us our chosen messengers despatch
whom i shall choose let them consent to go
then first of all let phoenix lead the way
beloved of jove the mighty ajax next
with them ulysses sage and let them take
of heralds hodius and eurybates
bring now the hallowing water for our hands
and bid be silent while to saturns son
that he have mercy we address our prayr

he said and well his counsel pleasd them all
the heralds pourd the water on their hands
the youths attending crownd the bowls with wine
and in due order servd the cups to all
then their libations made when each with wine
had satisfied his soul from out the tent
of agamemnon atreus son they passd
and many a caution aged nestor gave
with rapid glance to each ulysses chief
how best to soften peleus matchless son

beside the manydashing oceans shore
they movd along and many a prayr addressd
to neptune oceans earthsurrounding god
that he to gentle counsels would incline
the haughty soul of great æacides
when to the ships and tents they came where lay
the warlike myrmidons their chief they found
his spirit soothing with a sweettond lyre
of curious work with silver band adornd
part of the spoil he took when he destroyd
eetions wealthy town on this he playd
soothing his soul and sang of warriors deeds
before the chief in silence and alone
patroclus sat upon achilles fixd
his eyes awaiting till the song should cease
the envoys forward steppd ulysses first
and stood before him from his couch amazd
and holding still his lyre achilles sprang
leaving the seat whereon they found him placd
and at their entrance rose patroclus too
waving his hand achilles swift of foot
addressed them welcome friends as friends ye come
some great occasion surely to my tent
hath brought the men who are of all the greeks
despite my anger dearest to my heart

thus as he spoke he led them in and placd
on couches spread with purple carpets oer
then thus addressd patroclus at his side
son of menoetius set upon the board
a larger bowl and stronger mix the wine
and serve a cup to each beneath my roof
this night my dearest friends i entertain
he said patroclus his commands obeyd
and in the firelight placd an ample tray
and on it laid of goats flesh and of sheeps
a saddle each and with them rich in fat
a chine of wellfed hog automedon
held fast while great achilles carvd the joints
the meat prepard he fixd upon the spits
patroclus kindled then a blazing fire
and when the fire burnt hotly and the flame
subsided spread the glowing embers out
and hung the spits above then sprinkled oer
the meat with salt and lifted from the stand
the viands cookd and placd upon the board
from baskets fair patroclus portiond out
the bread to each the meat achilles shard
facing the sage ulysses sat the host
on th other side the tent and bade his friend
patroclus give the gods their honours due
he in the fire the wonted offrings burnt
they on the viands set before them fell
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
ajax to phoenix signd ulysses saw
the sign and rising filld a cup with wine
and pledgd achilles thus to thee i drink
achilles nobly is thy table spread
as heretofore in agamemnons tent
so now in thine abundant is the feast
but not the pleasures of the banquet now
we have in hand impending oer our arms
grave cause of fear illustrious chief we see
grave doubts to save or see destroyd our ships
if thou great warrior put not forth thy might
for close beside the ships and wall are campd
the haughty trojans and renownd allies
their watchfires frequent burn throughout the camp
and loud their boast that nought shall stay their hands
until our darkribbd ships be made their prey
jove too for them with favring augury
sends forth his lightning boastful of his strength
and firmly trusting in the aid of jove
hector resistless rages nought he fears
or god or man with martial fury fird
he prays impatient for th approach of morn
then breaking through the lofty sterns resolvd
to the devouring flames to give the ships
and slay the crews bewilderd in the smoke
and much my mind misgives me lest the gods
his threats fulfil and we be fated here
to perish far from argos grassy plains
up then if in their last extremity
thy spirit inclines though late to save the greeks
sore pressd by trojan arms lest thou thyself
hereafter feel remorse the evil done
is past all cure then thou reflect betimes
how from the greeks to ward the day of doom
dear friend remember now thy fathers words
the aged peleus when to atreus son
he sent thee forth from phthia how he said
my son the boon of strength if so they will
juno or pallas have the powr to give
but thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb
for better far is gentle courtesy
and cease from angry strife that so the greeks
the more may honour thee both young and old
such were the words thine aged father spoke
which thou hast now forgotten yet een now
pause for awhile and let thine anger cool
and noble gifts so thou thy wrath remit
from agamemnon shalt thou bear away
listen to me while i recount the gifts
which in his tent he pledgd him to bestow
sevn tripods promisd he untouchd by fire
of gold ten talents twenty caldrons bright
twelve powrful horses in the course renownd
who by their speed have many prizes won
not emptyhanded could that man be deemd
nor poor in gold who but so much possessd
as by those horses has for him been won
sevn women too well skilld in household cares
lesbians whom he selected for himself
that day thou capturdst lesbos goodly isle
in beauty far surpassing all their sex
these will he give and with them will he send
the fair briseis her whom from thy tent
he bore away and add a solemn oath
he neer approachd her bed nor held with her
such intercourse as man with woman holds
all these shall now be thine but if the gods
shall grant us priams city to destroy
of gold and brass when we divide the spoil
with countless heaps a vessel shalt thou freight
and twenty captives thou thyself shalt choose
all only less than argive helen fair
and if it be our fate to see again
the teeming soil of argos thou mayst be
his son by marriage and in honour held
as is orestes who his only son
is reard at home in luxury and ease
three daughters fair are his chrysothemis
iphianassa and laodice
of these whicheer thou wilt to peleus house
no portion askd for thou shalt take to wife
and with her will he add such wedding gifts
as never man before to daughter gave
sevn prosprous towns besides cardamyle
and enope and iras grassy plains
and pherae and antheias pastures deep
æpeia fair and vineclad pedasus
all by the sea by sandy pylos bounds
the dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich
and as a god will honour thee with gifts
and to thy sceptre ample tribute pay
all these he gives so thou thy wrath remit
but if thou hold atrides in such hate
him and his gifts yet let thy pity rest
on all the other greeks thus sore bested
by whom thou shalt be honourd as a god
for great the triumph that thou now mayst gain
een hectors self is now within thy reach
for he is near at hand and in his pride
and martial fury deems that none of all
our ships contain can rival him in arms

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
heavnborn ulysses sage in council son
of great laertes i must frankly speak
my mind at once my fixd resolve declare
that from henceforth i may not by the greeks
by this man and by that be importund
him as the gates of hell my soul abhors
whose outward words his secret thoughts belie
hear then what seems to me the wisest course
on me nor agamemnon atreus son
nor others shall prevail since nought is gaind
by toil unceasing in the battle field
who nobly fight but share with those who skulk
like honours gain the coward and the brave
alike the idlers and the active die
and nought it profits me though day by day
in constant toil i set my life at stake
but as a bird though ill she fare herself
brings to her callow brood the food she takes
so i through many a sleepless night have lain
and many a bloody day have labourd through
engagd in battle on your wives behalf
twelve cities have i taken with my ships
eleven more by land on trojan soil
from all of these abundant stores of wealth
i took and all to agamemnon gave
he safe beside his ships my spoils receivd
a few divided but the most retaind
to other chiefs and kings he meted out
their sevral portions and they hold them still
from me from me alone of all the greeks
he bore away and keeps my cherishd wife
well let him keep her solace of his bed
but say then why do greeks with trojans fight
why hath atrides brought this mighty host
to troy if not in fairhaird helens cause
of mortals are there none that love their wives
save atreus sons alone or do not all
who boast the praise of sense and virtue love
and cherish each his own as her i lovd
een from my soul though captive of my spear
now since he once hath robbd me and deceivd
let him not seek my aid i know him now
and am not to be won let him devise
with thee ulysses and the other kings
how best from hostile fires to save his ships
he hath completed many mighty works
without my aid hath built a lofty wall
and dug a trench around it wide and deep
and in the trench hath fixd a palisade
nor so the warriorslayer hectors might
can keep in check while i was in the field
not far without the walls would hector range
his line of battle nor beyond the oak
and scaean gates would venture there indeed
he once presumd to meet me hand to hand
and from my onset narrowly escapd
but as with hector now no more i fight
tomorrow morn my offrings made to jove
and all the gods and freighted well my ships
and launchd upon the main thyself shall see
if that thou care to see my vessels spread
oer the broad bosom of the hellespont
my lusty crews plying the vigrous oar
and if th earthshaker send a favring breeze
three days will bear us home to phthias shore
there did i leave abundant store of wealth
when hitherward i took my luckless way
thither from hence i bear of ruddy gold
and brass and women fair and iron hoar
the share assignd me but my chiefest prize
the monarch agamemnon atreus son
himself who gave with insult takes away
to him then speak aloud the words i send
that all may know his crimes if yet he hope
some other greek by treachrous wiles to cheat
clothd as he is in shamelessness my glance
all brazen as he is he dare not meet
i share no more his counsels nor his acts
he hath deceivd me once and wrongd again
he shall not cozen me of him enough
i pass him by whom jove hath robbd of sense
his gifts i loathe and spurn himself i hold
at a hairs worth and would he proffer me
tenfold or twentyfold of all he has
or ever may be his or all the gold
sent to orchomenos or royal thebes
egyptian treasurehouse of countless wealth
who boasts her hundred gates through each of which
with horse and car two hundred warriors march
nay were his gifts in number as the sand
or dust upon the plain yet neer will i
by agamemnon be prevaild upon
till i have paid him back my hearts offence
nor eer of agamemnon atreus son
will i a daughter wed not were she fair
as golden venus and in works renownd
as pallas blueeyd maid yet her een so
i wed not let him choose some other greek
some fitting match of nobler blood than mine
but should the gods in safety bring me home
at peleus hands i may receive a wife
and greece can boast of many a lovely maid
in hellas or in phthia daughters fair
of chiefs who hold their native fortresses
of these at will a wife i may select
and ofttimes hath my warlike soul inclind
to take a wedded wife a fitting bride
and aged peleus wealth in peace enjoy
for not the stores which troy they say containd
in peaceful times ere came the sons of greece
nor all the treasures which apollos shrine
the archergod in rockbuilt pythos holds
may weigh with life of oxen and of sheep
successful forays may good store provide
and tripods may be gaind and noble steeds
but when the breath of man hath passd his lips
nor strength nor foray can the loss repair
i by my goddessmother have been warnd
the silverfooted thetis that oer me
a double chance of destiny impends
if here remaining round the walls of troy
i wage the war i neer shall see my home
but then undying glory shall be mine
if i return and see my native land
my glory all is gone but length of life
shall then be mine and death be long deferrd
if others askd my counsel i should say
homeward direct your course of lofty troy
ye see not yet the end allseeing jove
oer her extends his hand on him relying
her people all with confidence are filld
go then my answer to the chiefs of greece
speak boldlysuch the privilege of age
bid that some better counsel they devise
to save their ships and men their present scheme
my anger unappeasd avails them nought
but phoenix here shall stay and sleep tonight
and with the morrow he with me shall sail
and seek our native land if so he will
for not by force will i remove him hence

he said they all confounded by his words
in silence heard so sternly did he speak
at length in tears the aged phoenix spoke
for greatly feard he for the ships of greece
if great achilles on returning home
thy mind is set nor canst thou be inducd
to save the ships from fire so fierce thy wrath
how then dear boy can i remain behind
alone whom with thee aged peleus sent
that day when he in agamemnons cause
from phthia sent thee inexperiencd yet
in all the duties of confedrate war
and sage debate on which attends renown
me then he sent instructor of thy youth
to prompt thy language and thine acts to guide
so not from thee dear boy can i consent
to part though heavn should undertake my age
to prompt thy language and thine acts to guide
so not from thee dear boy can i consent
to part though heavn should undertake my age
to wipe away and vigrous youth restore
such as i boasted when from greece i fled
before my angry sire amyntor son
of ormenus a fairhaird concubine
cause of the quarrel her my father lovd
and by her love estrangd despisd his wife
my mother oft she prayd me to seduce
to vex th old man my fathers concubine
i yielded he suspecting on my head
a curse invokd and on the furies calld
his curse to witness that upon his knees
no child by me begotten eer should sit
his curse the gods have heard and ratified
th infernal king and awful proserpine
then would i fain have slain him with the sword
had not some god my rising fury quelld
and set before my mind the public voice
the odium i should have to bear mid greeks
if branded with the name of patricide
but longer in my angry fathers house
to dwell my spirit brookd not though my friends
and kinsmen all besought me to remain
and many a goodly sheep and many a steer
they slew and many swine with fat oerlaid
they singd and roasted oer the burning coals
and drank in many a cup the old mans wine
nine nights they kept me in continual watch
by turns relieving guards the fires meanwhile
burnt constant one beneath the porch that facd
the wellfencd court one in the vestibule
before my chamber door the tenth dark night
my chambers closelyfitting doors i broke
and lightly vaulted oer the courtyard fence
by guards alike and servant maids unmarkd
through all the breadth of hellas then i fled
until at length to phthias fruitful soil
mother of flocks to peleus realm i came
who kindly welcomd me and with such love
as to his only son his wellbelovd
a father shows his genrous gifts bestowd
he gave me wealth he gave me ample rule
and on the bounds of phthia bade me dwell
and oer the dolopes hold sovreign sway
thee too achilles rival of the gods
such as thou art i made thee from my soul
i lovd thee nor wouldst thou with others go
or to the meal or in the house be fed
till on my knee thou sattst and by my hand
thy food were cut the cup were tenderd thee
and often in thy childish helplessness
the bosom of my dress with wine was drenchd
such care i had of thee such pains i took
remembring that by heavns decree no son
of mine i eer might see then thee i made
achilles rival of the gods my son
that thou mightst be the guardian of mine age
but thou achilles curb thy noble rage
a heart implacable beseems thee not
the gods themselves in virtue honour strength
excelling thee may yet be mollified
for they when mortals have transgressd or faild
to do aright by sacrifice and prayr
libations and burntoffrings may be soothd
prayrs are the daughters of immortal jove
but halt and wrinkled and of feeble sight
they plod in ates track while ate strong
and swift of foot outstrips their laggard pace
and dealing woe to man oer all the earth
before them flies they following heal her wounds
him who with honour welcomes their approach
they greatly aid and hear him when he prays
but who rejects and sternly casts them off
to saturns son they go and make their prayr
that ate follow him and claim her dues
then to the daughters of immortal jove
do thou achilles show the like respect
that many another brave mans heart hath swayd
if to thy tent no gifts atrides brought
with promises of more but still retaind
his vehement enmity i could not ask
that thou thy cherishd anger shouldst discard
and aid the greeks how great soeer their need
but now large offrings hath he givn and more
hath promisd and of all the greeks hath sent
to pray thine aid the men thou lovst the best
discredit not their mission nor their words
till now i grant thee none could blame thy wrath
in praise of men in ancient days renownd
this have we heard that howsoeer might rage
their hostile feuds their anger might be still
by gifts averted and by words appeasd
one case i bear in mind in times long past
and not in later days and here mid friends
how all occurrd will i at length recite
time was that with ætolias warlike bands
round calydon the acarnanians fought
with mutual slaughter these to save the town
the acarnanians burning to destroy
this curse of war the goldenthroned queen
diana sent in anger that from her
œneus the firstfruits of his field withheld
the other gods their hecatombs receivd
dianas shrine alone no offrings deckd
neglected or oerlookd the sin was great
and in her wrath the arrowdarting queen
a savage wildboar sent with gleaming tusks
which œneus vineyard haunting wrought him harm
there laid he prostrate many a stately tree
with root and branch with blossom and with fruit
him meleager son of œneus slew
with youths and dogs from all the neighbouring towns
collected smaller force had not availd
so huge he was so fierce and many a youth
had by his tusks been laid upon the bier
a fierce contention then the goddess raisd
for the boars head and bristly hide between
the acarnanian and th ætolian bands
while warlike meleager kept the field
so long the acarnanians fard but ill
nor dard despite the numbers of their host
maintain their ground before the city walls
when he to anger yielded which sometimes
swells in the bosom een of wisest men
incensd against his mother he withdrew
to cleopatra fair his wedded wife

with her retiring from the field he nursd
his wrath resenting thus his mothers curse
althaea she her brothers death bore hard
and prayd to heavn above and with her hands
beating the solid earth the nether powrs
pluto and awful proserpine implord
down on her knees her bosom wet with tears
death on her son invoking from the depths
of erebus erinnys heard her prayr
gloomhaunting goddess dark and stern of heart
soon round the gates the din of battle rose
the towrs by storm assaulted then his aid
th ætonian elders and the sacred priests
with promises of great reward implord
a fruitful plot they bade him set apart
the richest land in lovely calydon
of fifty acres half for vineyard meet
and half of fertile plain for tillage cleard
upon the threshold of his lofty rooms
old œneus stood and at the portals closd
he knockd in vain a suppliant to his son
his sisters and his brother joind their prayrs
but sterner his rejection of their suit
the friends he valued most and lovd the best
yet they too faild his fixd resolve to shake
till to his very doors the war had reachd
the foe upon the towrs the town in flames
then meleagers beauteous wife at length
in tears beseeching him the thousand ills
recalld which on a capturd town attend
the slaughterd men the city burnt with fire
the helpless children and deepbosomd dames
a prey to strangers listning to the tale
his spirit was rousd within him and again
he took the field and donnd his glittring arms
thus did his act from doom th ætolians save
spontaneous yet he gaind not though he savd
the rich reward they once were pledgd to give
but be not thou like him nor let thy god
turn thitherward thy thoughts our ships on fire
thine aid will less be prizd come take the gifts
and as a god be honourd by the greeks
if thou hereafter unsolicited
the battle join the greeks thou mayst protect
but not an equal share of honour gain

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
phoenix my second father revrend sire
such honours move me not my honour comes
from jove whose will it is that i should here
remain beside the ships while i retain
breath in my lungs and vigour in my limbs
this too i say and bear it in thy mind
disturb me not with weeping and complaints
to do atrides grace if him thou love
my love for thee perchance may turn to hate
my friend should honour him who honours me
but come with me and of my kingdom half
and equal honours shalt thou share with me
these shall our message bear stay thou the while
and on soft couch repose tomorrow morn
will we determine or to sail or stay

he said and with his eyebrows gave a sign
in silence to patroclus to prepare
a bed for phoenix that without delay
the rest might leave the tent then thus began
ajax the godlike son of telamon
ulysses sage laertes highborn son
depart we now for this way our discourse
can lead to no result behoves us bear
our tidings all unwelcome as they are
back to the chiefs awaiting our return
achilles hath allowd his noble heart
to cherish rancour and malignant hate
nor reeks he of his old companions love
wherewith we honourd him above the rest
relentless he a sons or brothers death
by payment of a fine may be atond
the slayer may remain in peace at home
the debt dischargd the other will forego
the forfeiture receivd his just revenge
but thou maintainst a stern obdurate mood
and for a single girl we offer sevn
surpassing fair and other gifts to boot
we now bespeak thy courtesy respect
thy hearth remember that beneath thy roof
we stand deputed by the genral voice
of all the host and fain would claim to be
of all the greeks thy best and dearest friends

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
illustrious ajax son of telamon
without offence hast thou thy message givn
but fury fills my soul wheneer i think
how agamemnon mid th assembled greeks
insulting held me forth to public scorn
as some dishonourd houseless vagabond
but go ye now and bear my answer back
no more in bloody war will i engage
till noble hector priams godlike son
oer slaughterd greeks your ships enwrappd in fire
shall reach the quarters of the myrmidons
ere he assail my ship and tents i think
that hector valiant as he is will pause
thus he they each the double goblet raisd
and to the gods their due libations pourd
ulysses leading to the ships returnd

meanwhile patroclus bade th attendant maids
prepare a bed for phoenix they obeyd
and quickly laid the bed with fleeces warm
and rugs and linen light and fine oerspread
there slept th old man and waited for the morn
within the tents recess achilles slept
and by his side from lesbos captive brought
daughter of phorbas diomede fair
on th other side patroclus lay with him
the graceful iphis whom when scyros isle
he capturd and enyes rockbuilt fort
achilles to his lovd companion gave

when to atrides tent the envoys came
the chiefs uprising pledgd them one by one
in golden goblets then their tidings askd
first agamemnon king of men enquird
tell me renownd ulysses pride of greece
what says he will he save our ships from fire
or still in wrathful mood withhold his aid

to whom again ulysses stout of heart
most mighty agamemnon king of men
his anger is not quenchd but fiercer still
it glows thy gifts and thee alike he spurns
he bids thee with the other chiefs concert
the means thy people and thy ships to save
and menaces himself at early dawn
to launch his welltrimmd vessels on the main
nay more he counsels others so he says
homeward to turn since here of lofty troy
we see not yet the end allseeing jove
oer her extends his hand on him relying
her people all with confidence are filld
such was his language here before you stand
ajax and both the heralds sage grave men
who with me went and will confirm my words
old phoenix left we there so willd the chief
that with the morrow he with him may sail
and seek their native land if so he will
for not by force will he remove him hence

ulysses thus they all in silence heard
amazd so stern the message that he bore
long time in silence sat the chiefs of greece
outspoke at length the valiant diomed
most mighty agamemnon king of men
would that thou neer hadst stoopd with costly gifts
to sue for aid from peleus matchless son
for he before was overproud and now
thine offers will have tenfold swolln his pride
but leave we him according to his will
to go or stay he then will join the fight
when his own spirit shall prompt or heavn inspire
but hear ye all and do as i advise
refreshd with food and wine  turn we to our rest
and when the rosyfingerd morn appears
thyself among the foremost with bold hearts
before our ships both horse and foot array

he said and all the chiefs with loud applause
his speech confirmd then due libations pourd
each to his sevral tent they all withdrew
then laid them down and sought the boon of sleep





in nightlong slumbers lay the other chiefs
of all the greeks by gentle sleep subdued
but not on agamemnon atreus son
by various cares oppressd sweet slumber fell
as when from jove the fairhaird junos lord
flashes the lightning bringing in its train
tempestuous storm of mingled rain and hail
or snow by winter sprinkled oer the fields
or opning wide the ravnous jaws of war
so agamemnon from his inmost heart
pourd forth in groans his multitudinous grief
his spirit within him sinking on the plain
he lookd and there alarmd the watchfires saw
which far advancd before the walls of troy
blazd numberless and thence of pipes and flutes
he heard the sound and busy hum of men
upon the ships he lookd and men of greece
and by the roots his hair in handfuls tore
to jove on high deep groand his mighty heart
thus as he musd the wisest course appeard
with nestor son of neleus to confer
if they some scheme in council might devise
to ward destruction from the grecian host
he rose and oer his body drew his vest
and underneath his wellturnd feet he bound
his sandals fair then oer his shoulders threw
down reaching to his feet a lions skin
tawny and vast then graspd his pondrous spear

on menelaus weighd an equal dread
nor on his eyes that night had slumber sat
lest ill befall the greeks who in his cause
crossing the watry waste had come to troy
and bold defiance to the trojans givn
round his broad chest a panthers skin he threw
then on his head his brazen helmet placd
and in his brawny hand a lance he bore
to meet his brother went he forth of greece
the mighty monarch as a god reverd
him by the ship he found in act to arm
and welcome was his presence to the king

then valiant menelaus first began
why thus in arms good brother seekst thou one
the trojan camp to spy i greatly fear
that none will undertake the task alone
to spy the movements of the hostile camp
in the dark night stouthearted he must be

to whom the monarch agamemnon thus
great need my noble brother have we both
of sagest counsels if we hope the greeks
and grecian ships from ruin to preserve
since turnd against us is the mind of jove
to hectors offrings most his soul inclines
for never have i seen or heard men tell
how in one day one man has wrought such loss
as hector dear to jove yet not the son
of god or goddess on the greeks has wrought
such deeds hath he achievd such havoc made
as we shall long in bitter memry keep
haste thou amid the ships and hither bring
idomeneus and ajax i the while
will nestor rouse and urge that he with us
the outposts visit and instruct the guard
to him they best will listen for his son
commands the watch with him meriones
the follower of the king idomeneus
to them by prefrence hath this charge been givn

he said and menelaus answerd thus
what wouldst thou have me do then here remain
with them and wait thy coming or to them
thy message give and follow in thy steps

him answerd agamemnon king of men
remain thou here lest haply we might fail
to meet for in the camp are many paths
but thou whereer thou gost each sevral man
address and ask to rise to each his name
and patronymic giving pay to each
all due respect nor bear thee haughtily
we like the rest must share the load of toil
which jove assigns to all of mortal birth

his brother thus with counsels wise dismissd
the king to aged nestor took his way
him by his tent and darkribbd ship he found
on a soft couch beside him lay his arms
his shield two lances and a glittring helm
there lay the richwrought belt the old man wore
when to the battle armd he led his troops
for nought to ages weakness would he yield
raising his head and on his elbow proppd
he questiond thus atrides who art thou
that wandrest through th encampment thus alone
in the dark night when other mortals sleep
seekst thou some mule broke loose or comrade lost
speak nor in silence come what wouldst thou here

to whom thus agamemnon king of men
o nestor son of neleus pride of greece
know me for agamemnon atreus son
on whom hath jove beyond the lot of men
laid grief that neer shall end while i retain
breath in my lungs and vigour in my limbs
i wander thus because these eyes of mine
sweet slumber visits not by cares of war
oppressd and harassd by the woes of greece
much for the greeks i fear nor keeps my mind
its wonted firmess i am ill at ease
and leaps my troubled heart as tho twould burst
my bosoms bounds my limbs beneath me shake
but if thou wilt since thou too knowst not sleep
together to the outposts let us go
and see if there by toil and sleep oerpowrd
the guard repose neglectful of their watch
the foe is close at hand nor are we sure
he may not hazard een a night attack

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
most mighty agamemnon king of men
not all the hopes that hector entertains
shall by the lord of counsel be fulfilld
for him are toil and danger yet in store
if but achilles of his wrath repent
gladly will i attend thee others too
tydides spearman bold ulysses sage
ajax the swift and phyleus noble son
should all be summond and twere well that one
across the camp should run to call in haste
the godlike ajax and idomeneus
theirs are the farthest ships nor near at hand
but dear to me as menelaus is
and highly honourd i must blame that thus

he sleeps and leaves the toil to thee alone
with all the chiefs he should be busied now
imploring aid in this our utmost need

to whom thus agamemnon king of men
for other times old man reserve thy blame
sometimes i own he lags behind nor takes
his share of labour not from indolence
or want of sense but still regarding me
waiting from me an impulse to receive
but now before me he was up and came
to visit me and i have sent him on
to call those very men whom thou hast namd
come then for we beside the gates and guard
shall find them there my orders were to meet

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
then none can blame him nor can any greek
justly refuse his summons to obey

he said and round his body wrapped his vest
then on his feet his sandals fair he bound
and oer his shoulders claspd a purple cloak
doubled with ample folds and downy pile
then took his spear with point of sharpend brass
and through the camp prepard to take his way
gerenian nestor from his slumbers first
ulysses sage as jove in council rousd
loud shouting soon the voice his senses reachd
forth from his tent he came and thus he spoke
what cause so urgent leads you through the camp
in the dark night to wander thus alone

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
ulysses sage laertes godlike son
be not offended such the stress that now
weighs down our army come thou then with us
and others let us call with whom tis meet
that we should counsel take to fight or fly

he said ulysses to the tent returnd
then his broad shield across his shoulders thrown
came forth again and with them took his way
to diomed the son of tydeus next
they went and him they found beside his arms
without his tent his comrades slept around
their heads upon their bucklers laid their spears
stood upright on the butts the burnishd brass
like heavns own lightning flashing far around
stretchd on a wild bulls hide the chief reposd
a gaywrought carpet rolld beneath his head
gerenian nestor close behind him stood
and touched him with his foot and thus in tone
reproachful spoke arouse thee tydeus son
why sleepst thou thus all night or knowst thou not
that on the very margin of the plain
and close beside the ships the trojans lie
and little space between the camps is left

quick rousd from sleep thus answerd diomed
beshrew thy heart old man no labour seems
for thee too hard are there not younger men
to run about the camp and summon all
the sevral chiefs thou dost too much old man

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
true friend and full of wisdom are thy words
good sons indeed i have and followers brave
and many who might well my message bear
but great is now the stress that lies on greece
for on a razors edge is balancd now
to all the greeks the chance of life or death
do thou then go 
and if thou pity me thyself arouse
ajax the swift and phyleus noble son
he said the warrior round his shoulders threw
down reaching to his feet a lions hide
tawny and dark and took his pondrous spear
he went arousd and with him brought the chiefs

when to the guard they came not sunk in sleep
found they the leaders but on wakeful watch
intent and all alert beside their arms
as round a sheepfold keep their anxious watch
the dogs who in the neighbouring thicket hear
some beast that bold in search of prey has come
down from the mountain loud the clamours rise
of men and dogs all sleep is banishd thence
so from their eyes was banishd sleep who watchd
through that disastrous night still plainward turning
at evry movement in the trojan camp
the old man saw wellpleasd and thus addressd
with cheering words the captains of the guard
watch ever thus good youths nor be surprisd
by slumber lest the foe a triumph gain

this said he crossd the ditch and with him went
the grecian leaders to the council calld
with them admitted to the confrence went
meriones and nestors noble son
the deepdug ditch they crossd and sat them down
upon an open space from corpses clear
where hector from the slaughter of the greeks
turnd back when evning spread her veil around
there sat they down and there the confrence held
gerenian nestor first took up the word
o friends is any here with heart so bold
who dares selfconfident the trojan camp
to enter there some straggler he might take
or in the camp itself some tidings gain
what are their secret counsels if they mean
here by the ships to hold their ground or back
sated with victry to the town retire
this could he learn and hither scatheless bring
his tidings high as heavn in all mens mouths
would be his praise and ample his reward
for evry captain of a ship should give
a coalblack ewe and at her foot a lamb
a prize beyond compare and high should be
his place at banquets and at solemn feasts

he said but all the chiefs in silence heard
then rose the valiant diomed and said
nestor that heart is mine i dare alone
enter the hostile camp so close at hand
yet were one comrade givn me i should go
with more of comfort more of confidence
where two combine one before other sees
the better course and evn though one alone
the readiest way discover yet would be
his judgment slower his decision less

he said and many chiefs to diomed
profferd companionship stood forth at once
with him to penetrate the trojan camp
the two ajaces ministers of mars
stood forth meriones and eagerly
stood forth the son of nestor atreus son
the royal menelaus spearman bold
and stout ulysses whose enduring heart
for evry deed of valour was prepard
rose agamemnon king of men and said
tydides comrade dearest to my soul
choose thou thine own companion whom thou wilt
of all the many here that proffer aid
him whom thou deemst the best nor from respect
to persons leave the better man behind
and take the worse nor defrence show to rank
not though the purest royal blood were his

in fear for menelaus thus he spoke
then answerd valiant diomed and said
if my companion i may freely choose
how can i pass the sage ulysses by
of ready wit and dauntless courage provd
in evry danger and to pallas dear
i should not fear by him accompanied
to pass through fire and safely both return
so far in prudence he surpasses all

whom answerd thus ulysses stout of heart
tydides nor exaggerated praise
bestow on me nor censure for thou speakst
to those who know me all for what i am
but go we night wanes fast the morn is near
the stars are high in heavn and of the night
two thirds are spent one third alone remains

he said and both prepard to don their arms
the youthful warrior thrasymedes gave
to diomed a twoedgd sword  and ample shield
then on his brows a leathern headpiece placd
without or peak or plume a simple casque
such as is worn by youths to guard their head
a bow and wellfilld quiver and a sword
meriones to sage ulysses gave
and on his brows a leathern headpiece placd
well wrought within with numrous straps securd
and on th outside with wild boars gleaming tusks
profusely garnishd scatterd here and there
by skilful hand the midst with felt was lind
this from amyntor son of ormenus
autolycus from eleon bore away
spoil of his pillagd house autolycus
gave to amphidamas cytheran chief
who in scandea dwelt amphidamas
to molus pledge of friendship he again
gave to his son meriones from whom
it now encircled sage ulysses brow
thus with accoutrements and arms supplied
they left their brother chiefs and took their way
then close beside their path by pallas sent
rose on the right a heron through the gloom
they saw it not indeed but heard the cry
the favring sign with joy ulysses haild
and thus to pallas prayd hear me thou child
of aegisbearing jove who still hast stood
in evry peril at my side whose eye
my evry movement sees now goddess now
befriend me grant that safe with triumph crownd
we may return some great exploit achievd
such as the trojans long may bear in mind

him following thus the brave tydides prayd
my voice too child of jove undaunted hear
and be with me as with my father erst
the godlike tydeus when to thebes he went
an envoy in advance and left behind
upon asopus banks the mailclad greeks
smooth was the message which to thebes he bore
but great his mission ended were the deeds
that with thine aid he wrought for goddess thou
wast with him and thine arm was his defence
so be thou now with me and me defend
then on thine altar will i sacrifice
a yearling heifer broad of brow untamd
whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid
her will i give and tip her horns with gold

thus as they prayd their prayr the goddess heard
then their devotions ended on they fard
through the deep dead of night like lions twain
mid slaughter corpses arms and blackend gore

nor in the trojan camp did hector leave
the chiefs to rest but all to confrence calld
the leaders and the councillors of troy
to whom his prudent speech he thus addressd
who is there here that for a rich reward
a noble work will undertake a car
and two strongcollard horses best of all
that can be found within the grecian lines
shall he receive who to his endless praise
shall dare approach the ships and learn if still
they keep their wonted watch or by our arms
subdued and vanquished meditate retreat
and worn with toil the nightly watch neglect
thus hector spoke but all in silence heard

there was one dolon in the trojan camp
the heralds son eumedes rich in gold
and brass not fair of face but swift of foot
amid five sisters he the only son
who thus to hector and the trojans spoke

hector with dauntless courage i will dare
approach the ships and bring thee tidings sure
but hold thou forth thy royal staff and swear
that i the horses and the brassbound car
shall have the boast of peleus matchless son
not vain shall be my errand nor deceive
thy hopes right through the camp i mean to pass
to agamemnons tent where all the chiefs
debate in council or to fight or fly

he said and hector took his royal staff
and swore to him be witness jove himself
the lord of thunder that no trojan man
thyself except shall eer those horses drive
for thee they are reservd a glorious prize

thus hector swore though unfulfilld the oath
the hope to dolon fresh assurance gave
forthwith his bow across his shoulders slung
a grisly wolfskin oer it on his head
a cap of martens fur and in his hand
a javlin from the camp he took his way
straight to the grecian ships but never thence
destind to bring th expected tidings back

the crowd of men and horses left behind
briskly he movd along ulysses first
markd his approach and to tydides said
see from the camp where some one this way comes
with what intent i know not if to play
the spy about the ships or rob the dead
turn we aside and let him pass us by
a little way we then with sudden rush
may seize him or if he outstrip us both
by speed of foot may urge him towrd the ships
driving him still before us with our spears
and from the city cutting off his flight
thus saying mid the dead beside the road
they crouchd he all unconscious hastend by
but when such space was interposd as leave
between the sluggish oxen and themselves
a team of mules 
they rushd upon him at the sound he stoppd
deeming that from the trojan camp they came
by hector sent to order his return
within a spears length when they came or less
for foes he knew them and to night addressd
his active limbs they rushd in hot pursuit
and as two hounds well practisd in the chase
with glistning fangs unflagging strain to catch
in woodland glade some pricket deer or hare
that flies before them screaming so those two
tydides and ulysses stout of heart
with fiery zeal unflagging straind to catch
the flying dolon from the camp cut off
but when the fugitive approachd the ships
close by the guard fresh vigour pallas gave
to diomed lest haply from the walls
some other might anticipate his blow
and he himself but second honours gain
tydides then with threatning gesture cried
stop or i hurl my spear and small thy chance
if i assail thee of escape from death
he said and threw his spear but by design
it struck him not above his shoulder flew
the polishd lance and quiverd in the ground
sudden he stoppd with panic paralysd
his teeth all chattring pale with fear he stood
with faltring accents panting they came up
and seizd him in their grasp he thus in tears
spare but my life my life i can redeem
for ample stores i have of gold and brass
and wellwrought iron and of these my sire
would pay a genrous ransom could he learn
that in the grecian ships i yet survivd

to whom ulysses deepdesigning thus
be of good cheer nor let the fear of death
disturb thy mind but tell me truly this
how is t that towrd the ships thou comst alone
in the still night when other mortals sleep
comst thou perchance for plunder of the dead
or seekst upon our ships to play the spy
by hector sent or of thine own accord

then dolon thushis knees with terror shook
with much persuasion of my better mind
hector beguild me offring as my prize
achilles horses and his brassbound car
through the dark night he sent me and enjoind
entring your hostile camp to learn if still
ye keep your wonted watch or by our arms
subdued and vanquishd meditate retreat
and worn with toil your nightly watch neglect

to whom ulysses thus with scornful smile
high soard thy hopes indeed that thought to win
the horses of achilles hard are they
for mortal man to harness or control
save for achilles self the goddessborn
but tell me truly this when here thou camst
where leftst thou hector guardian chief of troy
where are his warlike arms his horses where
where lie the rest and where are placd their guards
what are their secret counsels do they mean
here by the ships to keep their ground or back
sated with victry to the town return

whom dolon answerd thus eumedes son
thy questions all true answers shall receive
hector with those who share his counsels sits
in confrence far apart near ilus tomb
but for the guards thou speakst of noble chief
not one is stationd to protect the camp
around the trojan fires indeed perforce
a watch is kept and they among themselves
due caution exercise but for th allies
they sleep and to the trojans leave the watch
since nor their children nor their wives are near

to whom in answer sage ulysses thus
say now where sleep they with the trojans mixd
or separate explain that i may know

whom answerd dolon thus eumedes son
to this too will i give ye answer true
next to the sea the carian forces lie
the paeon archers and the leleges
the caucons and the bold pelasgians next
on thymbras side the lycians lot has falln
the mysians brave the phrygian cavalry
and the maeonians with their horsehair plumes
but why of these enquire if ye intend
an inroad on the camp apart from all
new come the farthest off the thracians lie
rhesus their king the son of eioneus
sleeps in the midst no steeds that eer i saw
for size and beauty can with his compare
whiter than snow and swifter than the wind
with gold and silver is his chariot wrought
his armour golden of gigantic size
a marvel to behold it seems not meet
for mortal man but for th immortal gods
but take me now in safety to the ships
or leave me here in fetters bound that so
ere ye return ye may approve my words
and see if i have told you true or no

to whom thus diomed with stern regard
dolon though good thy tidings hope not thou
once in our hands to scape the doom of death
for if we now should let thee go again
in after times thou mightst our ships approach
as secret spy or open enemy
but if beneath my hands thou lose thy life
no farther trouble shalt thou cause the greeks
he said and as the suppliant sought in vain
to touch his beard imploring through his throat
both tendons sevring drove his trenchant blade
evn while he spoke his head was rolld in dust
the cap of marten fur from off his head
they took the wolfskin and the bow unstrung
and javlin these ulysses held aloft
and thus to pallas prayd who gave the spoil
receive great goddess these our gifts to thee
of all th immortals on olympus height
our offrings first we give conduct us now
the thracian camp and thracian steeds to gain

thus as he spoke amid the tamarisk scrub
far off he threw the trophies then with reeds
and twigs new broken from the tamarisk boughs
he set a mark lest in the gloom of night
returning they might haply miss the spot
then on they passd thro arms and blackend gore
and reachd the confines of the thracian camp
there found they all by sleep subdued their arms
beside them on the ground in order due
in triple rows and by the side of each
harnessd and yokd his horses ready stood
surrounded by his warriors rhesus slept
beside him stood his coursers fleet their reins
suspended to the chariots topmost rail
ulysses markd him as he lay and said
this is the man tydides these the steeds
to us by dolon whom we slew describd
now then put forth thy might beseems it not
to stand thus idly with thine arms in hand
loose thou the horses or do thou the men
despatch and to my care the horses leave

he said and pallas vigour new inspird
that right and left he smote dire were the groans
of slaughterd men the earth was red with blood
and as a lion on th untended flock
of sheep or goats with savage onslaught springs
evn so tydides on the thracians sprang
till twelve were slain and as tydides sword
gave each to death ulysses by the feet
drew each aside reflecting that perchance
the horses startled might refuse to pass
the corpses for as yet they knew them not
but when tydides saw the sleeping king
a thirteenth victim to his sword was givn
painfully breathing for by pallas art
he saw that night as in an evil dream
the son of œneus standing oer his head
meanwhile ulysses sage the horses loosd
he gatherd up the reins and with his bow
 he drove them forth
then softly whistling to tydides gave
a signal he the while remaind behind
musing what bolder deed he yet might do
whether the seat whereon the arms were laid
to draw away or lifted high in air
to bear it off in triumph on the car
or on the thracians farther loss inflict
but while he musd beside him pallas stood
and said bethink thee tydeus son betimes
of thy return lest if some other god
should wake the trojans thou shouldst need to fly

she said the heavnly voice he recognizd
and mounted straight the car ulysses touchd
the horses with his bow and urgd to speed
they towrd the ships their rapid course pursued

nor idle watch apollo kept who saw
tydides oer the plain by pallas led
with anger filld the trojan camp he sought
and rhesus kinsman good hippocoon
the thracian councillor from sleep arousd
awaking when the vacant space he viewd
where late had stood the horses and his friends
gasping in death and weltring in their blood
he groand as on his comrades name he calld
then loud the clamour rose and wild uproar
unspeakable of trojans thronging round
they marvelld at the deeds but marvelld more
how they who wrought them had escapd unscathd

meantime arrivd where hectors scout they slew
ulysses lovd of heavn a moment checkd
his eager steeds tydides from the car
leapd to the ground and in ulysses hand
the bloody trophies placd then mounted quick
and towrd the ships their destind goal urgd on
the fiery horses nothing loth they flew
nestor first heard the sound and cried o friends
the leaders and the councillors of greece
am i deceivd or is it true methinks
the sound of horses hurrying strikes mine ear
grant heavn ulysses and brave diomed
may bring those horses from the trojan camp
yet much i fear our bravest may have met
with some disaster mid the crowd of foes

he scarce had ended when themselves appeard
and from the car descended welcomd back
with cordial grasp of hands and friendly words
gerenian nestor first enquiring said
tell me renownd ulysses pride of greece
whence come these horses from the trojan camp
or hath some god that met you by the way
bestowd them radiant as the beams of light
among the trojans day by day i move
tis not my wont old warrior though i be
to lag behind but horses such as these
i never saw some god hath givn them sure
for jove the cloudcompeller loves you both
and pallas child of aegisbearing jove

to whom again the sage ulysses thus
o nestor son of neleus pride of greece
had they so willd the gods so great their powr
een better horses could have givn than these
but these old man are thracians newly come
whose king the valiant diomed hath slain
and with him twelve the best of all his band
a scout too have we slain by hector sent
and by the trojan chiefs to spy our camp

he said and oer the ditch the horses drove
exulting in their prize and with him went
the other chiefs rejoicing through the camp
arrivd at diomeds wellorderd tent
first with strong halters to the rack where stood
highfed with corn his own swiftfooted steeds
the horses they securd ulysses then
the bloody spoils of dolon stowd away
in the ships stern till fitting sacrifice
to pallas might be offerd to the sea
descending then they washd away the sweat
which on their necks and thighs and knees had dried
the sweat washd off and in the ocean waves
themselves refreshd they sought the polishd bath
then by the bath restord and all their limbs
anointed freely with the lissom oil
sat down to breakfast and from flowing bowls
in pallas honour pourd the luscious wine





now rose aurora from tithonus bed
to mortals and immortals bringing light
when to the ships of greece came discord down
despatchd from jove with dire portents of war
upon ulysses lofty ship she stood
the midmost thence to shout to either side
or to the tents of ajax telamon
or of achilles who at each extreme
confiding in their strength had moord their ships
there stood the goddess and in accents loud
and dread she calld and fixd in evry breast
the fierce resolve to wage unwearied war
and dearer to their hearts than thoughts of home
or wishd return became the battlefield

atrides loudly shouting calld the greeks
to arms himself his flashing armour donnd
first on his legs the wellwrought greaves he fixd
fastend with silver clasps his ample chest
a breastplate guarded givn by cinyras
in pledge of friendship for in cyprus isle
he heard the rumour of the glorious fleet
about to sail for troy and sought with gifts
to win the favour of the mighty king
ten bands were there inwrought of dusky bronze
twelve of pure gold twice ten of shining tin
of bronze six dragons upwards towrds the neck
their length extended three on either side
in colour like the bow which saturns son
placd in the clouds a sign to mortal men
then oer his shoulder threw his sword bright flashd
the golden studs the silver scabbard shone
with golden baldrick fitted next his shield
he took fullsizd wellwrought wellprovd in fight
around it ran ten circling rims of brass
with twenty bosses round of burnishd tin
and in the centre one of dusky bronze
a gorgons head with aspect terrible
was wrought with fear and flight encircled round
depending from a silver belt it hung
and on the belt a dragon wrought in bronze
twind his lithe folds and turnd on evry side
sprung from a single neck his triple head
then on his brow his lofty helm he placd
fourcrested doublepeakd with horsehair plumes
that noddedfearful from the warriors head
then took two weighty lances tippd with brass
which fiercely flashd against the face of heavn
pallas and juno thundring from on high
in honour of mycenæs wealthy lord

forthwith they orderd each his charioteer
to stay his car beside the ditch themselves
on foot in arms accoutred sallied forth
and loud ere early dawn the clamour rose
advancd before the cars they lind the ditch
followd the cars a little space between
but jove with dire confusion filld their ranks
who sent from heavn a showr of bloodstaind rain
in sign of many a warriors coming doom
soon to the viewless shades untimely sent
meanwhile upon the slope beneath the plain
the trojan chiefs were gatherd hectors self
polydamas æneas as a god
in revrence held antenors three brave sons
agenors godlike presence polybus
and heavnly fair the youthful acamas
in front was seen the broad circumference
of hectors shield and as amid the clouds
shines forth the fiery dogstar bright and clear
anon beneath the cloudy veil conceald
so now in front was hector seen and now
passd to the rear exhorting all in brass
his burnishd arms like joves own lightning flashd

as in the cornland of some wealthy lord
the rival bands of reapers mow the swathe
barley or wheat and fast the trusses fall
so greeks and trojans mowd th opposing ranks
nor these admitted thought of faint retreat
but still made even head while those like wolves
rushd to the onset discord goddess dire
beheld rejoicing of the heavnly powrs
she only mingled with the combatants
the others all were absent they serene
reposd in gorgeous palaces for each
amid olympus deep recesses built
yet all the cloudgirt son of saturn blamd
who willd the victry to the arms of troy
he heeded not their anger but withdrawn
apart from all in pride of conscious strength
surveyd the walls of troy the ships of greece
the flash of arms the slayers and the slain

while yet twas morn and waxd the youthful day
thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell
on either side but when the hour was come
when woodmen in the forests deep recess
prepare their food and wearied with the toil
of felling loftiest trees with aching arms
turn with keen relish to their midday meal
then grecian valour broke th opposing ranks
as each along the line encouragd each
first sprang the monarch agamemnon forth
and brave bienor slew his peoples guard
and with the chief his friend and charioteer
oileus he downleaping from the car
stood forth defiant but between his brows
the monarchs spear was thrust nor aught availd
the brassbound helm to stay the weapons point
through helm and bone it passd and all the brain
was shatterd forward as he rushd he fell
them left he there their bare breasts gleaming white
strippd of their arms and hastend in pursuit
of antiphus and isus priams sons
a bastard one and one legitimate
both on one car the bastard held the reins
beside him stood the gallant antiphus
them as they fed their flocks on idas heights
achilles once had captive made and bound
with willow saplings till for ransom freed
the mighty monarch agamemnon drove
through isus breast his spear his weighty sword
descended on the head of antiphus
beside the ear and hurld him from his car
these of their armour he despoild in haste
known to him both for he had seen them oft
beside the ships when thither captive brought
from ida by achilles swift of foot
as when a lion in their lair hath seizd
the helpless offspring of a mountain doe
and breaks their bones with ease and with strong teeth
crushes their tender life nor can their dam
though close at hand she be avail them aught
for she herself by deadly terror seizd
through the thick coppice and the forest flies
panting and bathd in sweat the monsters rush
so dard no trojan give those brethren aid
themselves in terror of the warlike greeks
peisander next and bold hippolochus
sons of antimachus  the king assaild
both on one car but from their hands had droppd
the broiderd reins bewilderd there they stood
while with a lions bound upon them sprang
the son of atreus suppliant in the car
they claspd his knees give quarter atreus son
redeem our lives our sire antimachus
possesses goodly store of brass and gold
and wellwrought iron and of these he fain
would pay a noble ransom could he hear
that in the grecian ships we yet survivd

thus they with gentle words and tears imploring
but all ungentle was the voice they heard
in answer if indeed ye be the sons
of that antimachus who counsel gave
when noble menelaus came to troy
with sage ulysses as ambassadors
to slay them both nor suffer their return
pay now the forfeit of your fathers guilt
he said and with a spearthrust through his breast
peisander dashd to earth backward he fell
down leapd hippolochus but atreus son
severing his hands and neck amid the throng
sent whirling like a bowl the gory head
these left he there and where the thickest throng
maintaind the tug of war thither he flew
and with him eager hosts of wellgreavd greeks
soon on the trojans flight enforcd they hung
destroying foot on foot and horse on horse
while from the plain thick clouds of dust arose
beneath the armed hoofs of clattring steeds
and on the monarch agamemnon pressd
still slaying urging still the greeks to arms
as when amid a densely timberd wood
light the devouring flames by eddying winds
hither and thither borne fast falls the copse
prostrate beneath the fires impetuous course
so thickly fell the flying trojans heads
beneath the might of agamemnons arm
and here and there athwart the pass of war
was many an empty car at random whirld
by strongneckd steeds of guiding hands bereft
stretchd on the plain they lay more welcome sight
to carrion birds than to their widowd wives
but hector from the fray and din of war
and dust and blood and carnage jove withdrew
still on atrides pressd the greek pursuit
with eager shouts exciting past the tomb
of ilus ancient son of dardanus
and towrd the figtree midway oer the plain
straining to gain the town the trojans fled
while loudly shouting his unconquerd hands
with carnage dyed atrides urgd their flight
but when the scaean gates and oak were reachd
they made a stand and facd the foes assault
some oer the open plain were yet dispersd
as heifers by a lion scatterd wide
at dead of night all fly on one descends
the doom of death her with his powrful teeth
he seizes and her neck first broken rends
and on her entrails gorging laps her blood
so these the monarch agamemnon chasd
slaying the hindmost they in terror fled
some headlong backward some atrides hand
hurld from their chariot many a warrior bold
so forward and so fierce he bore his spear
but as he neard the city and stood beneath
the lofty wall the sire of gods and men
from heavn descended on the topmost height
of idas springabounding hill he sat
and while his hand the lightning graspd he thus
to goldenwinged iris gave command

haste thee swift iris and to hector bear
from me this message bid him that as long
as agamemnon in the van appears
raging and dealing death among the ranks
he from the battle keep himself aloof
but urge the rest undaunted to maintain
the stubborn fight but should atrides struck
by spear or arrow to his car withdraw
he shall from me receive such powr to slay
as to the ships shall bear him ere the sun
decline and darkness spread her hallowing shade

thus he to troy obedient to his word
from idas heights swiftfooted iris sped
amid the horses and the wellframd cars
the godlike hector priams son she found
and stood beside him and addressd him thus

hector thou son of priam sage as jove
in council he the universal lord
sends thee by me this message that as long
as agamemnon in the van appears
raging and dealing death amid the ranks
thou from the battle keep thyself aloof
but urge the rest undaunted to maintain
the stubborn fight but should atrides struck
by spear or arrow to his car withdraw
thou shalt from him receive such powr to slay
as to the ships shall bear thee ere the sun
decline and darkness spread her hallowing shade

swiftfooted iris said and disappeard
but from his chariot hector leapd to earth
hither and thither passing through the ranks
with brandishd javlins urging to the fight
loud at his bidding rose the battlecry
back rolld the tide again they facd the greeks
on th other side the greeks their masses formd
in line of battle rangd opposed they stood
and in the front to none content to cede
the foremost place was agamemnon seen

say now ye nine who on olympus dwell
of all the trojans and their famd allies
who first opposd to agamemnon stood
iphidamas antenors gallant son
stalwart and brave in fertile thracia bred
mother of flocks him in his infant years
his grandsire cisseus fair theanos sire
in his own palace reard and when he reachd
the perfect measure of his glorious youth
still in his house retaind him and to wife
gave him his daughter but when tidings came
of grecian warfare from the marriage straight
embarking with twelve beaked ships he sailed
that owned his sway these on percotes shore
he left and came himself on foot to troy
who now confronted atreus godlike son

when near they drew atrides missd his aim
his spear diverging then iphidamas
beneath the breastplate striking on his belt
strove with strong hand to drive the weapon home
yet could not pierce the belts closeplaited work
the point encounterd by the silver fold
was bent like lead then with his powrful hand
the monarch agamemnon seizd the spear
and towrd him drew and with a lions strength
wrenchd from his foemans grasp then on his neck
let fall his sword and slackd his limbs in death
there falling in his countrys cause he slept
the iron sleep of death unhappy he
far from his virginbride yet unpossessd
though bought with costly presents first he gave
a hundred steers and promisd thousands more
of sheep and goats from out his countless flocks
him agamemnon of his arms despoild
and to the crowd of greeks the trophies bore
but when antenors eldestborn beheld
coon th observd of all men bittrest grief
his eyes oershadowd for his brothers fate
and unperceivd by atreus godlike son
standing aside he struck him with his spear
through the mid arm beneath the elbows bend
and drove right through the weapons glittring point
writhd with the pain the mighty king of men
yet from the combat flinchd he not nor quaild
but grasping firm his weathertoughend spear
on coon rushd as by the feet he drew
his fathers son iphidamas away
invoking all the bravest to his aid
and as he drew the body towrd the crowd
beneath the bossy shield the monarch thrust
his brassclad spear and slackd his limbs in death
then near approaching evn upon the corpse
of dead iphidamas struck off his head
so by atrides hand antenors sons
their doom accomplishd to the shades were sent
then through the crowded ranks with spear and sword
and massive stones he held his furious course
while the hot blood was welling from his arm
but when the wound was dry and stanchd the blood
keen anguish then atrides might subdued
as when a woman in her labourthroes
sharp pangs encompass by lucina sent
who rules oer childbirth travail evn so keen
the pangs that then atrides might subdued
mounting his car he bade his charioteer
drive to the ships for sore his spirit was paind
but loud and clear he shouted to the greeks
o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
yours be it now our seaborne ships to guard
since jove the lord of counsel through the day
wills not that i the battle should maintain

he said and swiftly to the ships were drivn
his sleekskinnd coursers nothing loth they flew
with foam their chests were fleckd with dust their flanks
as from the field their wounded lord they bore
but hector as he saw the king retire
to trojans and to lycians calld aloud

trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter quit ye now like men
put forth your wonted valour from the field
their bravest has withdrawn and jove on me
great glory hath shed now headlong on the greeks
urge your swift steeds and endless honour gain

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
and as a hunter cheers his sharpfangd hounds
on forest boar or lion on the greeks
so cheerd the valiant trojans priams son
illustrious hector stern as bloodstaind mars
bent on high deeds himself in front advancd
fell on the masses as a whirlwind falls
lashing with furious sweep the darkblue sea

say then who first who last by hectors hand
whom jove had willd to crown with honour died
assaeus first and then autonous
opites and opheltius dolops son
of clytus and æsumnus agelas
and orus and brave hipponous
all these the chiefs of greece the nameless crowd
he scatterd next as when the west wind drives
the clouds and battles with the hurricane
before the clearing blast of notus drivn
the big waves heave and roll and high aloft
the gale careering flings the ocean spray
so thick and furious fell on hostile heads
the might of hector now had fearful deeds
been done and greeks beside their ships had falln
in shameful rout had not ulysses thus
to diomed the son of tydeus calld

why son of tydeus should we thus relax
our warlike courage come stand by me now
true friend if hector of the glancing helm
our ships should capture great were our disgrace

whom answerd thus the valiant diomed
beside thee will i stand and still endure
but brief will be the term of our success
since jove the cloudcompeller not to us
but to the trojans wills the victory

he said and from his car thymbraeus hurld
through the left breast transfixd ulysses hand
his charioteer the brave molion slew
these left they there no more to share the fight
then turning spread confusion mid the crowd
as turn two boars upon the hunters pack
with desprate courage turning so to bay
those two the trojans scattring gave the greeks
from hector flying time again to breathe
a car they seizd which bore two valiant chiefs
sons of percotian merops he oer all
in lore prophetic skilld would fain at home
have kept them from the lifedestroying war
but they by adverse fate impelld to seek
their doom of death his warning voice despisd
these two of strength and life at once bereft
the son of tydeus valiant diomed
strippd of their armour while ulysses slew
hippodamus and bold hyperochus
thus jove from idas height beholding held
his even scale each party slaughtring each
then with his spear tydides through the loins
agastrophus the son of paeon smote
no car had he at hand whereto to fly
but illadvisd had in th attendants charge
his horses left far off while he himself
rushd mid the throng on foot and met his doom
hectors quick glance athwart the files beheld
and to the rescue with a shout he sprang
the trojan columns following not unmovd
the valiant diomed his coming saw
and thus bespoke ulysses at his side
on us this plague this mighty hector falls
yet stand we firm and boldly meet the shock
he said and poising hurld his pondrous spear
and not in vain on hectors head it struck
his helmets crest but brass encountring brass
himself it reachd not for the visord helm
apollos gift threeplated stayd its force
yet backward hector sprang amid the crowd
and on his knees he droppd his stalwart hand
proppd on the ground while darkness veild his eyes
but ere tydides following up his spear
attaind from far the spot whereon he fell
hector revivd and mounting quick his car
drove mid the crowd and scapd the doom of death
then thus with threatning spear tydides cried
yet once again vile hound hast thou escapd
thy doom was nigh but thee thy god hath savd
phoebus to whom amid the clash of spears
well mayst thou pray we yet shall meet again
when i shall end thee if a guardian god
i too may claim meanwhile from thee i turn
and others seek on whom my hap may light

he said and turnd him of his arms to strip
the son of paeon but beside the stone
that markd where men of old had raisd a mound
to ilus dardans son the ancient chief
there crouching paris fairhaird helens lord
against the son of tydeus bent his bow
he from the breast of brave agastrophus
had strippd the corslet from his shoulders broad
the buckler and the helmet from his head
when paris bent his bow and not in vain
his arrow launchd tydides dexter foot
right through it piercd and pinnd it to the ground
joyous he laughd and from his hiding place
sprang forth and thus in tones of triumph cried

thou hast it not in vain my shaft hath flown
would that deep buried in thy flank it touchd
thy very life so should our trojans lose
their panic fear who now on thee with dread
as bleating goats upon a lion look

to whom unmovd the valiant diomed
poor archer trusting to thy bow alone
vile slandrer and seducer if indeed
thou durst in arms opposd to me to stand
nought would avail thy arrows and thy bow
and now because thy shaft hath grazd my foot
thou makst thine empty boast i heed thee not
more than a woman or a puny child
a worthless cowards weapon hath no point
tis diffrent far with me though light it fall
my spear is sharp and whom it strikes it slays
his widows cheeks are markd with scars of grief
his children orphans rotting on the ground
red with his blood he lies his funral rites
by carrion birds and not by women paid

thus while he spoke ulysses spearman bold
drew near and stood before him he behind
sat down protected and from out his foot
the arrow drew whereat sharp anguish shot
through all his flesh and mounting on his car
he bade his faithful charioteer in haste
drive to the ships for pain weighd down his soul
alone ulysses stood of all the greeks
not one beside him all were panicstruck
then with his spirit perturbd he commund thus
me miserable which way shall i choose
twere ill indeed that i should turn to flight
by hostile numbers daunted yet twere worse
here to be caught alone and saturns son
with panic fear the other greeks hath filld
yet why my soul admit such thoughts as these
i know that cowards from the battle fly
but he who boasts a warriors name must learn
wounded or wounding firmly still to stand

while in his mind and spirit thus he musd
onward the bucklerd ranks of trojans came
and to their harm encircled him around
as when a boar by dogs and stalwart youths
attackd the sheltring thicket leaves and whets
the tusks that gleam between his curved jaws
they crowd around though ring his clattring tusks
and fearful though it be await his rush
so crowded round ulysses dear to jove
the trojans he with brandishd spear aloft
sprang forth and through the shoulder from above
deiopites wounded thoon next
he slew and ennomus then with his spear
chersidamas in act to quit his car
thrust through the loins below his bossy shield
prone in the dust he clutchd the bloodstaind soil
from these he turnd and wounded with his spear
charops the highborn socus brother son
of hippasus then forward sprang to aid
his brother godlike socus close he stood
before ulysses and addressd him thus
farfamd ulysses as in arms in wiles
unwearied thou this day oer both the sons
of hippasus two mighty warriors slain
and of their armour spoild shalt make thy boast
or by my spear thyself shalt lose thy life
he said and on the shields broad circle struck
through the bright shield the sturdy weapon drove
and through the richwrought baldrick from the ribs
tearing the flesh away but pallas seizd
and turnd it from the vital parts aside
the wound ulysses knew was not to death
and back he drew and thus to socus cried

illfated thou thy doom hath found thee now
me hast thou hinderd from the war awhile
but thee to swift destruction and dark death
this day i doom great glory of thee subdued
shall i obtain and hades take thy soul

thus he and socus turning sought to fly
but as he turnd him round ulysses spear
behind his neck between the shoulder blades
was drivn and through his chest thundring he fell
and oer his fall ulysses vaunting thus

socus thou son of warlike hippasus
here hast thou found nor couldst escape thy doom
illfated thou nor sires nor mothers hand
shall gather up thy bones but carrion birds
oer thee shall flap their baleful wings and tear
thy mangled flesh for me wheneer i die
the sons of greece will build my funral pile
from out his flesh and from the bossy shield
the spear of socus as he spoke he drew
and as he drew it forth out gushd his blood
with anguish keen the trojans when they saw
ulysses blood with clamrous shouts advancd
promiscuous he retiring shouted loud
to call his comrades loud as head of man
could bear he shouted thrice and thrice his shout
the warlike menelaus heard and thus
to ajax standing by his side he spoke

ajax thou heavnborn son of telamon
great chief of men methinks i hear the voice
of stout ulysses as though left alone
and in the stubborn fight cut off from aid
by trojans overmasterd haste we then
for so twere best to give him present aid
brave though he be yet left alone i fear
great cause we greeks may have to mourn his loss

he spoke and led the way the godlike chief
followd his steps ulysses dear to jove
surrounded by the trojan host they found
as hungry jackals on the mountain side
around a stag that from an archers hand
hath taken hurt yet while his blood was warm
and limbs yet servd has baffled his pursuit
but when the fatal shaft has draind his strength
thirsting for blood beneath the forest shade
the jackals seize their victim then if chance
a hungry lion pass the jackals shrink
in terror back while he devours the prey
so round ulysses sage in council pressd
the trojans many and brave yet nobly he
averted spear in hand the fatal hour
till with his towrlike shield before him borne
appeard great ajax and beside him stood
hither and thither then the trojans fled
while with supporting arm from out the crowd
the warlike menelaus led him forth
till his attendant with his car drew near
then ajax on the trojans springing slew
doryclus royal priams bastard son
next pyrasus he smote and pandocus
lysander and pylartes as a stream
swolln by the rains of heavn that from the hills
pours down its wintry torrent on the plain
and many a blighted oak and many a pine
it bears with piles of driftwood to the sea
so swept illustrious ajax oer the plain
oerthrowing men and horses though unknown
to hector he upon scamanders banks
was warring on the fields extremest left
where round great nestor and the warlike king
idomeneus while men were falling fast
rose irrepressible the battle cry
hector mid these was working wondrous deeds
with spear and car routing th opposed youth
yet had the greeks evn so their ground maintaind
but godlike paris fairhaird helens lord
through the right shoulder with a threebarbd shaft
as in the front he fought machaon quelld
for him the warrior greeks were sore afraid
lest he as back the line of battle rolld
might to the foe be left to nestor then
idomeneus addressd his speech and said

o nestor son of neleus pride of greece
haste thee to mount thy car and with thee take
machaon towrd the vessels urge with speed
the flying steeds worth many a life is his
the skilful leech who knows with practisd hand
t extract the shaft and healing drugs apply

he said gerenian nestor at the word
mounted his car machaon at his side
the skilful leech sage æsculapius son
he touchd his horses towrd the grecian ships
as was his purpose nothing loth they flew

to hector then cebriones who saw
confusd the trojans right drew near and said

hector we here on th outskirts of the field
oerpowr the greeks on th other side our friends
in strange confusion mingled horse and man
are drivn among them ajax spreads dismay
the son of telamon i know him well
and the broad shield that oer his shoulders hangs
thither direct we then our car where most
in mutual slaughter horse and foot engage
and loudest swells uncheckd the battle cry

he said and with the pliant lash he touchd
the sleekskinnd horses springing at the sound
between the greeks and trojans light they bore
the flying car oer bodies of the slain
and broken bucklers trampling all beneath
was plashd with blood the axle and the rails
around the car as from the horses feet
and from the felloes of the wheels were thrown
the bloody gouts yet on he sped to join
the strife of men and break th opposing ranks
his coming spread confusion mid the greeks
his spear awhile withheld then through the rest
with sword and spear and pondrous stones he rushd
but shunnd the might of ajax telamon

but jove high thrond the soul of ajax filld
with fear aghast he stood his sevnfold shield
he threw behind his back and trembling gazd
upon the crowd then like some beast of prey
foot slowly following foot reluctant turnd
as when the rustic youths and dogs have drivn
a tawny lion from the cattle fold
watching all night and baulkd him of his prey
ravning for flesh he still th attempt renews
but still in vain for many a javlin hurld
by vigrous arms confronts him to his face
and blazing faggots that his courage daunt
till with the dawn reluctant he retreat
so from before the trojans ajax turnd
reluctant fearing for the ships of greece
as near a field of corn a stubborn ass
upon whose sides had many a club been broke
oerpowrs his boyish guides and entring in
on the rich forage grazes while the boys
their cudgels ply but vain their puny strength
yet drive him out when fully fed with ease
evn so great ajax son of telamon
the valiant trojans and their famd allies
still thrusting at his shield before them drove
yet would he sometimes rallying hold in check
the trojan host then turn again to flight
yet barring still the passage to the ships
midway between the trojans and the greeks
he stood defiant many javlins hurld
by vigrous arms were in their flight receivd
on his broad shield and many ere they reachd
their living mark fell midway on the plain
fixd in the ground in vain athirst for blood
him thus hard pressd by thickthrown spears beheld
eurypylus euaemons noble son
he hastend up and aimd his glittring spear
and apisaon phausias noble son
below the midriff through the liver struck
and straight relaxd in sudden death his limbs
forth sprang eurypylus to seize the spoils
but godlike paris saw and as he stoopd
from apisaons corpse to strip his arms
against eurypylus he bent his bow
and his right thigh transfixd the injurd limb
disabling in the wound the arrow broke
he mid his friends escaping death withdrew
and to the greeks with piercing shout he calld

o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
turn yet again and from the doom of death
great ajax save hard pressd by hostile spears
scarce can i hope he may escape with life
the desprate fight yet bravely stand and aid
the mighty ajax son of telamon

thus spoke the wounded hero round him they
with sloping shields and spears uplifted stood
ajax to meet them came and when he reachd
the friendly ranks again he turnd to bay
so ragd like blazing fire the furious fight

meanwhile the mares of neleus drenchd with sweat
bore nestor and machaon from the field
achilles saw and markd them where he stood
upon his lofty vessels prow and watchd
the grievous toil the lamentable rout
then on his friend patroclus from the ship
he calld aloud he heard his voice and forth
as mars majestic from the tent he came

and thus menoetius noble son began

why callst thou me what wouldst thou peleus son
to whom achilles swift of foot replied
son of menoetius dearest to my soul
soon must the suppliant greeks before me kneel
so insupportable is now their need
but haste thee now patroclus dear to jove
enquire of nestor from the battle field
whom brings he wounded looking from behind
most like he seemd to æsculapius son
machaon but his face i could not see
so swiftly past the eager horses flew

he said obedient to his friends command
quick to the tents and ships patroclus ran

they when they reachd the tent of neleus son
descended to the ground eurymedon
the old mans mares unharnessd from the car
while on the beach they facd the cooling breeze
which from their garments dried the sweat then turnd
and in the tent on easy seats reposd
for them the fairhaird hecamede mixd
a cordial potion her from tenedos
when by achilles taen the old man brought
daughter of great arsinous whom the greeks
on him their sagest councillor bestowd
before them first a table fair she spread
well polishd and with feet of solid bronze
on this a brazen canister she placd
and onions as a relish to the wine
and pale clear honey and pure barley meal
by these a splendid goblet which from home
th old man had brought with golden studs adornd
four were its handles and round each two doves
appeard to feed at either end a cup
scarce might another move it from the board
when full but aged nestor raisd with ease
in this their goddesslike attendant first
a genrous measure mixd of pramnian wine
then with a brazen grater shredded oer
the goatsmilk cheese and whitest barley meal
and of the draught compounded bade them drink
they drank and then relievd the parching thirst
with mutual converse entertaind the hour
before the gate divine patroclus stood
the old man saw and from his seat arose
and took him by the hand and led him in
and bade him sit but he refusing said

no seat for me thou venerable sire
i must not stay for he both awe and fear
commands who hither sent me to enquire
what wounded man thou hast i need not ask
i know machaon well his peoples guard
my errand done i must my message bear
back to achilles and thou knowst thyself
thou venerable sire how stern his mood
nay sometimes blames he where no blame is due

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
whence comes achilles pity for the greeks
by trojan weapons wounded knows he not
what depth of suffring through the camp prevails
how in the ships by arrow or by spear
sore wounded all our best and bravest lie
the valiant son of tydeus diomed
piercd by a shaft ulysses by a spear
and agamemnons self eurypylus
by a sharp arrow through the thigh transfixd
and here another whom but now i bring
shot by a bow from off the battle field
achilles valiant as he is the while
for grecian woes nor care nor pity feels
waits he until our ships beside the sea
in our despite are burnt by hostile fires
and we be singly slain not mine is now
the strength i boasted once of active limbs
o that such youth and vigour yet were mine
as when about a cattlelifting raid
we fought th eleans there itymoneus
i slew the son of brave hyperochus
who dwelt in elis and my booty drove
he sought to guard the herd but from my hand
a javlin struck him in the foremost ranks
he fell and terror seizd the rustic crowd
abundant store of plunder from the plain
we drove of horned cattle fifty herds
as many flocks of sheep as many droves
of swine as many widespread herds of goats
and thrice so many goldenchesnut mares
the foals of many running with their dams
to pylos neleus city these we drove
by night and much it gladdend neleus heart
that i though new to war such prize had won
when morn appeard the clearvoicd heralds calld
for all to whom from elis debts were due
collected thus the pylians leading men
division made for elis owd us much
such wrongs we few in pylos had sustaind
the might of hercules in former years
had stormd our town and all our bravest slain
twelve gallant sons had neleus i of these
alone was left the others all were gone
whence overproud th epeians treated us
with insult and highhanded violence
a herd of oxen now and numrous flock
of sheep th old man selected for himself
three hundred with their shepherds for to him
large compensation was from elis due
traind to the course four horses with their cars
he for the tripod at th elean games
had sent to run these augeas king of men
detaind and bade the drivers home return
bootless and grieving for their horses loss
th old man his words resenting and his acts
large spoils retaind the rest among the crowd
he shard that none might lose his portion due
these we disposd of soon and to the gods
due offrings made but when the third day rose
back in all haste in numbers horse and foot
our foes returnd with them the molion twins
yet boys untutord in the arts of war
far off by alpheus banks th extremest verge
of sandy pylos is a lofty mound
the city of thryum which around intent
to raze its walls their army was encampd
the plain already they had overspread
when pallas from olympus heights came down
in haste and bade us all prepare for war
on no unwilling ears her message fell
but eager all for fight but me to arm
neleus forbade and een my horses hid
deeming me yet unripe for deeds of war
yet so albeit on foot by pallas grace
a name i gaind above our noblest horse
there is a river minyis by name
hard by arene flowing to the sea
where we the pylian horse expecting morn
encampd by troops of footmen quickly joind
thence in all haste advancing all in arms
we reachd by midday alpheus sacred stream
there to oerruling jove our offrings made
to alpheus and to neptune each a bull
to pallas blueeyd maid a heifer fair
in orderd ranks we took our evning meal
and each in arms upon the rivers brink
lay down to rest for close beside us lay
th epeians on the towns destruction bent
then saw they mighty deeds of war displayd
for we as sunlight overspread the earth
to jove and pallas praying battle gave
but when the pylians and th epeians met
i first a warrior slew and seizd his car
bold spearman mulius augeas soninlaw
his eldest daughters husband agamede
the yellowhaird who all the virtues knew
of each medicinal herb the wide world grows
him with my brasstippd spear as on he came
i slew he fell i rushing to his car
stood mid the foremost ranks th epeians brave
fled diverse when they saw their champion fall
chief of their horsemen foremost in the fight
with the dark whirlwinds force i onward rushd
and fifty cars i took two men in each
fell to my spear and bit the bloody dust
then actors sons the molions had i slain
had not th earthshaking god their mighty sire
veild in thick cloud withdrawn them from the field
then jove great glory to the pylians gave
for oer the widespread plain we held pursuit
slaying and gathring up the scatterd arms
nor till cornclad buprasium and the rock
olenian and alesium termd the mound
stayd we our steeds there pallas bade us turn
there the last man i slew and left the greeks
back from buprasium drove their flying cars
to pylos magnifying all the name
mid men of nestor as mid gods of jove
such once was i mid men while yet i was
now to himself alone achilles keeps
his valour yet hereafter when the greeks
have perishd all remorse shall touch his soul
dear friend remember now th injunctions givn
by old menoetius when from phthian land
he sent thee forth to agamemnons aid
i and laertes godlike son within
heard all his counsel to the wellbuilt house
of peleus we on embassy had come
throughout achaias fertile lands to raise
the means of war menoetius there we found
achilles and thyself within the house
while in the courtyard aged peleus slew
and to the lord of thunder offerd up
a fattend steer and from a golden bowl
oer the burntoffring pourd the ruddy wine
we two while ye were busied with the flesh
stood at the gate surprisd achilles rose
and took us by the hand and bade us sit
dispensing all the hospitable rites
with food and wine recruited i began
my speech and urgd ye both to join the war
nor were ye loth to go much sage advice
your elders gave old peleus bade his son
to aim at highest honours and surpass
his comrades all menoetius actors son
to thee this counsel gave my son he said
achilles is by birth above thee far
thou art in years the elder he in strength
surpasses thee do thou with prudent words
and timely speech address him and advise
and guide him he will to his good obey

such were the old mans words but thou hast let
his counsel slip thy memry yet evn now
speak to achilles thus and stir his soul
if haply he will hear thee and who knows
but by the grace of heavn thou mayst prevail
for great is oft a friends persuasive powr
but if the fear of evil prophesied
or message by his goddessmother brought
from jove restrain him let him send thee forth
with all his force of warlike myrmidons
that thou mayst be the saving light of greece
then let him bid thee to the battle bear
his glittring arms if so the men of troy
scard by his likeness may forsake the field
and breathingtime afford the sons of greece
toilworn for little pause has yet been theirs
fresh and unwearied ye with ease may drive
to their own city from our ships and tents
the trojans worn and battlewearied men

thus he patroclus spirit within him burnd
and towrd achilles tent in haste he sped
but running as ulysses ship he passd
where was the council and the justiceseat
and where were built the altars of the gods
there met him halting from the battlefield
shot through the thigh euaemons heavnborn son
eurypylus his head and shoulders dank
with clammy sweat while from his grievous wound
streamd the dark blood yet firm was still his soul
menoetius noble son with pity saw
and deeply sorrowing thus addressd the chief

woe for the chiefs and councillors of greece
and must ye far from friends and native home
glut with your flesh the ravning dogs of troy
yet tell me this heavnborn eurypylus
still do the greeks gainst hectors giant force
make head or fall they vanquishd by his spear

to whom with prudent speech eurypylus
no source heavnborn patroclus have the greeks
of aid but all must perish by their ships
for in the ships lie all our bravest late
by spear or arrow struck by trojan hands
and fiercer hour by hour their onset grows
but save me now and lead me to the ships
there cut the arrow out and from the wound
with tepid water cleanse the clotted blood
then soothing drugs apply of healing powr
which from achilles thou tis said hast learnd
from chiron justest of the centaurs he
for podalirius and machaon both
our leeches one lies wounded in the tents
himself requiring sore the leechs aid
the other on the plain still dares the fight

to whom again menoetius noble son
how may this be say brave eurypylus
what must i do a messenger am i
sent by gerenian nestor prop of greece
with tidings to achilles yet evn so
i will not leave thee in this weary plight

he said and passing his supporting hand
beneath his breast the wounded warrior led
within the tent th attendant saw and spread
the oxhide couch then as he lay reclind
patroclus with his dagger from the thigh
cut out the biting shaft and from the wound
with tepid water cleansd the clotted blood
then pounded in his hands a root applied
astringent anodyne which all his pain
allayd the wound was dried and stanchd the blood





thus oer the wounded chief eurypylus
watchd in his tent menoetius noble son
but hand to hand the greeks and trojans fought
nor longer might the ditch th assault repel
nor the broad wall above which greeks had built
to guard their ships and round it dug the ditch
but to the gods no hecatombs had paid
that they the ships and all the stores within
might safely keep against the will of heavn
the work was done and thence not long endurd
while hector livd and peleus son his wrath
retaind and priams city untaken stood
so long the grecian wall remaind entire
but of the trojans when the best had falln
of greeks when some were slain some yet survivd
when the tenth year had seen the fall of troy
and greeks embarkd had taen their homeward way
then neptune and apollo counsel took
to sap the wall by aid of all the streams
that seaward from the heights of ida flow
rhesus caresus and heptaporus
granicus and æsepus rhodius
scamanders stream divine and simois
where helms and shields lay buried in the sand
and a whole race of warrior demigods
these all apollo to one channel turnd
nine days against the wall the torrent beat
and jove sent rain continuous that the wall
might sooner be submergd while neptunes self
his trident in his hand led on the stream
washing away the deep foundations laid
laborious by the greeks with logs and stones
now by fastflowing hellespont dispersd
the wall destroyd oer all the shore he spread
a sandy drift and bade the streams return
to where of old their silver waters flowd
such were in future days to be the works
of neptune and apollo but meanwhile
fierce ragd the battle round the firmbuilt wall
and frequent clatterd on the turrets beams
the hostile missiles by the scourge of jove
subdued the greeks beside their ships were hemmd
by hector scard fell minister of dread
who with the whirlwinds force as ever fought
as when by dogs and hunters circled round
a boar or lion in his pride of strength
turns on his foes while they in close array
stand opposite and frequent shoot their darts
nor yet his spirit quails but firm he stands
with suicidal courage swift he turns
where best to break the circling ranks whereer
he makes his rush the circling ranks give way
so hector here and there amid the crowd
urgd his companions on to cross the ditch
the fiery steeds shrank back and snorting stood
upon the topmost brink for the wide ditch
withheld them easy nor to leap nor cross
for steep arose on either side the banks
and at the top with sharpend stakes were crownd
thickset and strong which there the sons of greece
had planted to repel th invading foes
scarce might a horse with wellwheeld car attachd
essay the passage but on foot they burnd
to make th attempt and thus polydamas
approaching near to valiant hector spoke

hector and all ye other chiefs of troy
and brave allies in vain we seek to drive
our horses oer the ditch tis hard to cross
tis crownd with pointed stakes and them behind
is built the grecian wall there to descend
and from our cars in narrow space to fight
were certain ruin if it be indeed
the will of jove highthundring to confound
the greeks in utter rout and us to aid
i should rejoice that evry greek forthwith
far from his home should fill a nameless grave
but should they turn and we again be drivn
back from the ships and hurried down the ditch
such were our loss that scarce a messenger
would live to bear the tidings to the town
of our destruction by the rallied greeks
hear then my counsel let us all agree
with our attendants here upon the bank
to leave our horses and ourselves on foot
all armd press on where hector leads the greeks
if that their doom be nigh will make no stand

thus spoke polydamas his counsel pleasd
and hector sprang in arms from off his car
nor long the noble hector when they saw
delayd the other chiefs then gave command
each to his own attendant by the ditch
to keep the chariots all in due array
then parting formd in order of attack
in five divisions with their sevral chiefs
round hector throngd and bold polydamas
the best and bravest they who longd the most
to storm the wall and fight beside the ships
with them cebriones for hector left
to guard the horses one of lesser note
the next division was by paris led
agenor and alcathous the third
by helenus and brave deiphobus
two sons of priam asius was the third
asius the son of hyrtacus who brought
his towring fiery steeds from selles stream
hard by arisba stout æneas led
the fourth anchises son archilochus
with him and acamas antenors sons
both skilld alike in evry point of war
of the farfamd allies sarpedon held
the chief command and for his comrades chose
asteropaeus and the warlike might
of glaucus these oer all the rest he held
preeminent in valour save himself
who oer them all superior stood confessd
these interlacd their shields of tough bullshide
with eager step advancd and deemd the greeks
would unresisting fall before their ships
the other trojans and renownd allies
the words of wise polydamas obeyd
but asius son of hyrtacus refusd
his horses and his charioteer to leave
with them advancing to assail the ships
blind fool unconscious from before those ships
escapd from death with horses and with car
triumphant to the breezy heights of troy
he never shall return illomend fate
oershadowing dooms him by the spear to fall
of brave idomeneus deucalions son
he towrd the left inclind what way the greeks
with horse and chariot from the plain returnd
that way he drove his horses and the gates
unguarded found by bolt or massive bar
their warders held them opend wide to save
perchance some comrade flying from the plain
thither he bent his course with clamours loud
followd his troops nor deemd they that the greeks
would hold their ground but fall amid their ships
little they knew before the gates they found
two men two warriors of the prime two sons
illustrious of the spearskilld lapithae
stout polypoetes one pirithous son
with whom leonteus bold as bloodstaind mars
so stood these two before the lofty gates
as on the mountain side two towring oaks
which many a day have borne the wind and storm
firm rifted by their strong continuous roots
so in their arms and vigour confident
those two great asius charge undaunted met
on th other side with shouts and wild uproar
their bullshide shields uplifted high advancd
against the wellbuilt wall asius the king
iamenus orestes acamas
the son of asius and œnomaus
and thoon those within to save the ships
calling meanwhile on all the wellgreavd greeks
but when they saw the wall by trojans scald
and heard the cry of greeks in panic fear
sprang forth those two before the gates to fight
as when two boars upon the mountain side
await th approaching din of men and dogs
then sideways rushing snap the wood around
rippd from the roots loud clash their clattring tusks
till to the huntsmans spear they yield their lives
so clatterd on those champions brassclad breasts
the hostile weapons stubbornly they fought
relying on their strength and friends above
for from the wellbuilt towrs huge stones were hurld
by those who for themselves their tents and ships
maintaind defensive warfare thick they fell
as wintry snowflakes which the boistrous wind
driving the shadowy clouds spreads fast and close
oer all the surface of the fertile earth
so thick from grecian and from trojan hands
the weapons flew on helm and bossy shield
with grating sound the pondrous masses rang
then deeply groaning as he smote his thigh
thus spoke dismayd the son of hyrtacus
o father jove how hast thou lovd our hopes
to falsify who deemd not that the greeks
would stand our onset and resistless arms
but they as yellowbanded wasps or bees
that by some rocky pass have built their nests
abandon not their cavernd home but wait
th attack and boldly for their offspring fight
so from the gates these two though two alone
retire not till they be or taen or slain

he said but jove regarded not his words
so much on hectors triumph he was bent
like battle ragd round th other gates but hard
it were for me with godlike powr to paint
each sevral combat for around the wall
a more than human storm of stone was pourd
on evry side the greeks hard pressd perforce
fought for their ships while all the gods lookd on
indignant who the grecian cause upheld
fiercely the lapithae sustaind the war
stout polypoetes first pirithous son
smote through the brasscheekd helmet damasus
nor stayd the brazen helm the spear whose point
went crashing through the bone that all the brain
was shatterd onward as he rushd he fell
then pylon next and ormenus he slew
meantime leonteus scion true of mars
struck with unerring spear hippomachus
son of antimachus below the waist
then drawing from the sheath his trenchant sword
dashd through the crowd and hand to hand he smote
antiphates he backward fell to earth
menon iamenus orestes next
in quick succession to the ground he brought
from these while they their glittring armour strippd
round hector throngd and bold polydamas
the bravest and the best who longd the most
to storm the wall and burn with fire the ships
yet on the margin of the ditch they pausd
for as they sought to cross a sign from heavn
appeard to leftward of th astonishd crowd
a soaring eagle in his talons bore
a dragon huge of size of bloodred hue
alive and breathing still nor yet subdued
for twisting backward through the breast he piercd
his bearer near the neck he stung with pain
let fall his prey which droppd amid the crowd
then screaming on the blast was borne away
the trojans shuddring in their midst beheld
the spotted serpent dire portent of jove
then to bold hector thus polydamas
hector in council thou reprovst me oft
for good advice it is not meet thou sayst
that private men should talk beside the mark
in council or in war but study still
thine honour to exalt yet must i now
declare what seems to me the wisest course
let us not fight the greeks beside their ships
for thus i read the future if indeed
to us about to cross this sign from heavn
was sent to leftward of th astonishd crowd
a soaring eagle bearing in his claws
a dragon huge of size of bloodred hue
alive yet droppd him ere he reachd his home
nor to his nestlings bore th intended prey
so we een though our mighty strength should break
the gates and wall and put the greeks to rout
by the same road not scatheless should return
but many a trojan on the field should leave
slain by the greeks while they their ships defend
so would a seer well versd in augury
worthy of public credit read this sign

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
replied with stern regard polydamas
this speech of thine is alien to my soul
thy better judgment better counsel knows
but if in earnest such is thine advice
thee of thy senses have the gods bereft
who fain wouldst have us disregard the word
and promise by the nod of jove confirmd
and put our faith in birds expanded wings
little of these i reck nor care to look
if to the right and towrd the morning sun
or to the left and shades of night they fly
put we our trust in joves eternal will
of mortals and immortals king supreme
the best of omens is our countrys cause
why shouldst thou tremble at the battle strife
though evry trojan else were doomd to die
beside the ships no fear lest thou shouldst fall
unwarlike is thy soul nor firm of mood
but if thou shrink or by thy craven words
turn back another trojan from the fight
my spear shall take the forfeit of thy life

this said he led the way with joyous shouts
they followd all then jove the lightnings lord
from idas heights a storm of wind sent down
driving the dust against the grecian ships
which quelld their courage and to hector gave
and to the trojans fresh incitement they
on their own strength and heavnly signs relying
their force addressd to storm the grecian wall
they razd the counterscarp the battlements
destroyd and the projecting buttresses
which to sustain the towrs the greeks had fixd
deep in the soil with levers undermind
these once withdrawn they hopd to storm the wall
nor from the passage yet the greeks withdrew
but closely fencing with their bullshide shields
the broken battlements they thence hurld down
a storm of weapons on the foe beneath
commanding from the towr in evry place
were seen th ajaces urging to the fight
imploring these and those in sterner tones
rebuking who their warlike toil relaxd

friends grecians all ye who excel in war
and ye of modrate or inferior strength
though all are not with equal powrs endued
yet here is work for all bear this in mind
nor towrd the ships let any turn his face
by threats dismayd but forward press and each
encourage each if so the lightnings lord
olympian jove may grant us to repel
and backward to his city chase the foe

thus they with cheering words sustaind the war
thick as the snowflakes on a wintry day
when jove the lord of counsel down on men
his snowstorm sends and manifests his powr
hushd are the winds the flakes continuous fall
that the high mountain tops and jutting crags
and lotuscoverd meads are buried deep
and mans productive labours of the field
on hoary oceans beach and bays they lie
th approaching waves their bound oer all beside
is spread by jove the heavy veil of snow
so thickly new the stones from either side
by greeks on trojans hurld by these on greeks
and clatterd loud through all its length the wall
nor yet the trojans though by hector led
the gates had broken and the massive bar
but jove against the greeks sent forth his son
sarpedon as a lion on a herd
his shields broad orb before his breast he bore
wellwrought of beaten brass which th armrers hand
had beaten out and lind with stout bullshide
with golden rods continuous all around
he thus equippd two javlins brandishing
strode onward as a lion mountainbred
whom fasting long his dauntless courage leads
to assail the flock though in wellguarded fold
and though the shepherds there he find prepard
with dogs and lances to protect the sheep
not unattempted will he leave the fold
but springing to the midst he bears his prey
in triumph thence or in the onset falls
wounded by javlins hurld by stalwart hands
so prompted by his godlike courage burnd
sarpedon to assail the lofty wall
and storm the ramparts and to glaucus thus
son of hippolochus his speech addressd

whence is it glaucus that in lycian land
we two at feasts the foremost seats may claim
the largest portions and the fullest cups
why held as gods in honour why endowd
with ample heritage by xanthus banks
of vineyard and of wheat producing land
then by the lycians should we not be seen
the foremost to affront the raging fight
so may our wellarmd lycians make their boast
to no inglorious kings we lycians owe
allegiance they on richest viands feed
of luscious flavour drink the choicest wine
but still their valour brightest shows and they
where lycians war are foremost in the fight
o friend if we survivors of this war
could live from age and death for ever free
thou shouldst not see me foremost in the fight
nor would i urge thee to the glorious field
but since on man ten thousand forms of death
attend which none may scape then on that we
may glory on others gain or they on us

thus he nor glaucus from his bidding shrank
and forward straight they led the lycian powrs
menestheus son of peteus with dismay
observd their movement for on his command
inspiring terror their attack was made
he lookd around him to the grecian towrs
if any chief might there be found to save
his comrades from destruction there he saw
of war insatiable th ajaces twain
and teucer from the tent but newly come
hard by nor yet could reach them with his voice
such was the din such tumult rose to heavn
from clattring shields and horsehaircrested helms
and batterd gates now all at once assaild
before them fiercely strove th assaulting bands
to break their way he then thootes sent
his herald to th ajaces craving aid

haste thee thootes on th ajaces call
both if it may be so we best may hope
to scape the death which else is near at hand
so fierce the pressure of the lycian chiefs
undaunted now as ever in the fight
but if they too are hardly pressd at least
let ajax son of telamon be spard
and with him teucer skilled to draw the bow
he said the herald heard and straight obeyd
along the wall where stood the brassclad greeks
he ran and standing near th ajaces said

ajaces leaders of the brassclad greeks
the son of heavnborn peteus craves your aid
to share awhile the labours of his guard
both if it may be so he best may hope
to scape the death which else is near at hand
so fierce the pressure of the lycian chiefs
undaunted now as ever in the fight
but if ye too are hardly pressd at least
let ajax son of telamon be spard
and with him teucer skilld to draw the bow

he said the mighty son of telamon
consenting thus addresssd oileus son
ajax do thou and valiant lyeomede
exhort the greeks the struggle to maintain
while i go yonder to affront the war
to aid their need and back return in haste

thus saying ajax telamon set forth
and with him teucer went his fathers son
while by pandion teucers bow was borne
at brave menestheus towr within the wall
arrivd sore pressd they found the garrison
for like a whirlwind on the ramparts pourd
the lycians valiant councillors and chiefs
they quickly joind the fray and loud arose
the battlecry first ajax telamon
sarpedons comrade brave epicles slew
struck by a rugged stone within the wall
which lay the topmost of the parapet
of size prodigious which with both his hands
a man in youths full vigour scarce could raise
as men are now he lifted it on high
and downward hurld the fourpeakd helm it broke
crushing the bone and shattring all the skull
he like a diver from the lofty towr
fell headlong down and life forsook his bones
teucer meanwhile from off the lofty wall
the valiant glaucus pressing to the fight
struck with an arrow where he saw his arm
unguarded he no longer brookd the fray
back from the wall he sprang in hopes to hide
from grecian eyes his wound that none might see
and triumph oer him with insulting words
with grief sarpedon saw his friend withdraw
yet not relaxd his efforts thestors son
alcmaon with his spear he stabbd and back
the weapon drew he following prostrate fell
and loudly rang his arms of polishd brass
then at the parapet with stalwart hand
sarpedon tuggd and yielding to his force
down fell the block entire the wall laid bare
to many at once the breach gave open way
ajax and teucer him at once assaild
this with an arrow struck the glittring belt
around his breast whence hung his pondrous shield
but jove who willd not that his son should fall
before the ships the weapon turnd aside
then forward ajax sprang and with his spear
thrust at the shield the weapon passd not through
yet checkd his bold advance a little space
back he recoild but not the more withdrew
his soul on glory intent and rallying quick
thus to the warlike lycians shouted loud

why lycians thus your wonted might relax
tis hard for one alone how brave soeer
een though he break the rampart down to force
a passage to the ships but on with me
for work is here for many hands to do

he said and by the kings rebuke abashd
with fiercer zeal the lycians pressd around
their king and councillor on th other side
within the wall the greeks their squadrons massd
then were great deeds achievd nor thro the breach
could the brave troops of lycia to the ships
their passage force nor could the warrior greeks
repel the lycians from the ground where they
before the wall had made their footing good
as when two neighbours in a common field
each line in hand within a narrow space
about the limits of their land contend
between them thus the rampart drew the line
oer which the fullorbd shields of tough bullshide
and lighter bucklers on the warriors breasts
on either side they clove and many a wound
the pitiless weapons dealt on some who turnd
their neck and back laid bare on many more
who full in front and through their shields were struck
on evry side the parapet and towrs
with greek and trojan blood were spatterd oer
nor yet een so the greeks to flight were drivn
but as a woman that for wages spins
honest and true with wool and weights in hand
in even balance holds the scales to mete
her humble hire her childrens maintenance
so even hung the balance of the war
till jove with highest honour hector crownd
the son of priam he the foremost scald
the wall and loudly on the trojans calld

on valiant trojans on the grecian wall
break down and wrap their ships in blazing fires

thus he exhorting spoke they heard him all
and to the wall rushd numberless and swarmd
upon the ramparts bristling thick with spears
then hector stooping seizd a pondrous stone
that lay before the gates twas broad below
but sharp above and scarce two labring men
the strongest from the ground could raise it up
and load upon a wain as men are now
but he unaided lifted it with ease
so light it seemd by grace of saturns son
as in one hand a shepherd bears with ease
a fullsizd fleece and scarcely feels the weight
so hector towrd the portals bore the stone
which closd the lofty doublefolding gates
within defended by two massive bars
laid crosswise and with one cross bolt securd
close to the gate he stood and planting firm
his foot to give his arm its utmost powr
full on the middle dashd the mighty mass
the hinges both gave way the pondrous stone
fell inwards widely gapd the opning gates
nor might the bars within the blow sustain
this way and that the severd portals flew
before the crashing missile dark as night
his lowring brow great hector sprang within
bright flashd the brazen armour on his breast
as through the gates two javlins in his hand
he sprang the gods except no powr might meet
that onset blazd his eyes with lurid fire
then to the trojans turning to the throng
he calld aloud to scale the lofty wall
they heard and straight obeyd some scald the wall
some through the strongbuilt gates continuous pourd
while in confusion irretrievable
fled to their ships the panicstricken greeks




when jove had hector and the trojans brought
close to the ships he left them there to toil
and strife continuous turning his keen glance
to view far off th equestrian tribes of thrace
the warlike mysians and the men who feed
on milk of mares thence hippemolgi termd
a peaceful race the justest of mankind
on troy he turnd not once his piercing glance
nor deemd he any god would dare to give
to trojans or to greeks his active aid

no careless watch the monarch neptune kept
wondring he viewd the battle where he sat
aloft on wooded samos topmost peak
samos of thrace whence idas heights he saw
and priams city and the ships of greece

thither ascended from the sea he sat
and thence the greeks by trojans overborne
pitying he saw and deeply wroth with jove
then down the mountains craggy side he passd
with rapid step and as he movd along
beneath th immortal feet of oceans lord
quakd the huge mountain and the shadowy wood
three strides he took the fourth he reachd his goal
ægae where on the margin of the bay
his temple stood all glittring all of gold
imperishable there arrivd he yokd
beneath his car the brazenfooted steeds
of swiftest flight with manes of flowing gold
all clad in gold the golden lash he graspd
of curious work and mounting on his car
skimmd oer the waves from all the depths below
gambolld around the monsters of the deep
acknowledging their king the joyous sea
parted her waves swift flew the bounding steeds
nor was the brazen axle wet with spray
when to the ships of greece their lord they bore

down in the deep recesses of the sea
a spacious cave there is which lies midway
twixt tenedos and imbros rocky isle
th earthshaking neptune there his coursers stayd
loosd from the chariot and before them placd
ambrosial provender and round their feet
shackles of gold which none might break nor loose
that there they might await their lords return
then to the grecian army took his way

meantime by hector son of priam led
like fire or whirlwind pressd the trojans on
with furious zeal and shouts and clamour hoarse
in hopes to take the ships and all the chiefs
to slay beside them but from oceans depths
uprose th earthshaker circler of the earth
to calchas likeness and deep voice conformd
and rousd the fainting greeks th ajaces first
themselves with ardour filld he thus addressd
tis yours ajaces filld with courage high
discarding chilly fear to save the greeks
elsewhere i dread not much the trojan force
though they in crowds have scald the lofty wall
the wellgreavd greeks their onset may defy
yet greatly fear i lest we suffer loss
where that fierce fiery madman hector leads
who boasts himself the son of jove most high
but may some god your hearts inspire yourselves
firmly to stand and cheer your comrades on
so from your swiftlysailing ships ye yet
may drive the foe how bold soeer he be
though by olympian jove himself upheld

so spake th earthshaker circler of the earth
and with his sceptre touching both the chiefs
filld them with strength and courage and their limbs
their feet and hands with active vigour strung
then like a swiftwingd falcon sprang to flight
which down the sheer face of some lofty rock
swoops on the plain to seize his featherd prey
so swiftly neptune left the chiefs him first
departing knew oileus active son
and thus the son of telamon addressd
ajax since some one of th olympian gods
in likeness of a seer hath hither come
to urge us to the war 
i feel fresh spirit kindled in my breast
and newborn vigour in my feet and hands

whom answerd thus the son of telamon
my hands too grasp with firmer hold the spear
my spirit like thine is stirrd i feel my feet
instinct with fiery life nor should i fear
with hector son of priam in his might
alone to meet and grapple to the death

such was their mutual converse as they joyd
in the fierce transport by the god inspird
neptune meanwhile the other greeks arousd
who to the ships withdrawn their wasted strength
recruited for their limbs were faint with toil
and grief was in their hearts as they beheld
the trojan hosts that scald the lofty wall
they saw and from their eyes the teardrops fell
of safety desprate but th earthshaking god
amid their ranks appearing soon restord
their firm array to teucer first he came
to leitus and valiant peneleus
thoas deipyrus meriones
and young antilochus brave warriors all
and to the chiefs his winged words addressd

shame on ye grecian youths to you i lookd
as to our ships defenders but if ye
shrink from the perilous battle then indeed
our day is come to be by troy subdud
o heavn a sad and wondrous sight is this
a sight i never deemd my eyes should see
our ships assaild by trojan troops by those
who heretofore have been as timrous hinds
amid the forest depths the helpless prey
of jackals pards and wolves they here and there
uncertain heartless unresisting fly
such were the trojans once nor dard abide
no not an hour the strength and arms of greece
and these are they who now beside our ships
far from their city walls maintain the fight
emboldend by our great commanders fault
and slackness of the people who with him
offended scarce are brought to guard our ships
and feebly fighting are beside them slain
een though the mighty monarch atreus son
wideruling agamemnon be in truth
wholly to blame in this that he hath wrongd
the son of peleus yet tis not for us
our courage to relax arouse ye then
a brave mans spirit its vigour soon regains
that ye the best and bravest of the host
should stand aloof thus idly tis not well
if meaner men should from the battle shrink
i might not blame them but that such as ye
should falter indignation fills my soul
dear friends from this remissness must accrue
yet greater evils but with genrous shame
and keen remorse let each mans breast be filld
fierce is the struggle in his pride of strength
hector has forcd the gates and massive bars
and raging mid the ships maintains the war

thus neptune on the greeks reproving calld
then round th ajaces twain were clusterd thick
the serried files whose firm array nor mars
nor spiritstirring pallas might reprove
for there the bravest all in order due
waited the trojan charge by hector led
spear close by spear and shield by shield oerlaid
buckler to buckler pressd and helm to helm
and man to man the horsehair plumes above
that nodded on the warriors glittring crests
each other touchd so closely massed they stood
backward by many a stalwart hand were drawn
the spears in act to hurl their eyes and minds
turnd to the front and eager for the fray
on pourd the trojan masses in the van
hector straight forward urgd his furious course
as some huge boulder from its rocky bed
detachd and by the wintry torrents force
hurld down the cliffs steep face when constant rains
the massive rocks firm hold have undermind
with giant bounds it flies the crashing wood
resounds beneath it still it hurries on
until arriving at the level plain
its headlong impulse checkd it rolls no more
so hector threatning now through ships and tents
een to the sea to force his murdrous way
anon confronted by that phalanx firm
halts close before it while the sons of greece
with thrust of sword and doublepointed spears
stave off his onset he a little space
withdrew and loudly on the trojans calld

trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter stand ye firm not long
the greeks though densely massd shall bar my way
but soon methinks before my spear shall quail
if from the chief of gods my mission be
from jove the thundrer royal junos lord

his words fresh courage raisd in evry breast
on loftiest deeds intent deiphobus
the son of priam from the foremost ranks
his shields broad orb before him borne advancd
with airy step protected by the shield
at him meriones with glittring spear
took aim nor missd his mark the shields broad orb
of tough bullshide it struck but passd not through
for near the head the sturdy shaft was snappd
yet from before his breast deiphobus
held at arms length his shield for much he feard
the weapon of meriones but he
back to his comrades sheltring ranks withdrew
grievd at his baffled hopes and broken spear
then towrd the ships he bent his steps to seek
another spear which in his tent remaind
the rest mid wild uproar maintaind the fight

there teucer first the son of telamon
a warrior slew the son of mentor lord
of numrous horses imbrius spearman skilld
in former days ere came the sons of greece
he in pedaeus dwelt and had to wife
medesicaste priams bastard child
but when the welltrimmd ships of greece appeard
returnd to troy and there reverd by all
with priam dwelt who lovd him as a son
him teucer with his lance below the ear
stabbd and drew back the weapon down he fell
as by the woodmans axe on some high peak
falls a proud ash conspicuous from afar
scattring its tender foliage on the ground
he fell and loud his burnishd armour rang
forth teucer sprang to seize the spoil at whom
advancing hector aimd his glittring spear
he saw and stooping shunnd the brazen death
a little space but through the breast it struck
amphimachus the son of cteatus
the son of actor hastening to the fight
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang
then forward hector sprang in hopes to seize
the brazen helm that fitted well the brow
of brave amphimachus but ajax met
th advance of hector with his glittring spear
himself he reachd not all in dazzling brass
encasd but pressing on his bossy shield
drove by main force beyond where lay the dead
them both the greeks withdrew th athenian chiefs
stychius and brave menestheus bore away
amid the ranks of greece amphimachus
while as two lions high above the ground
bear through the brushwood in their jaws a goat
snatchd from the sharpfangd dogs protecting care
so filld with warlike rage th ajaces twain
lifted on high and of its armour strippd
the corpse of imbrius and oileus son
grievd at amphimachus his comrades death
cut from the tender neck and like a ball
sent whirling through the crowd the severd head
and in the dust at hectors feet it fell
then for his grandson slain fierce anger filld
the breast of neptune through the tents of greece
and ships he passd the greeks encouraging
and ills preparing for the sons of troy
him met idomeneus the warrior king
leaving a comrade from the battle field
wounded behind the knee but newly brought
borne by his comrades to the leechs care
he left him eager to rejoin the fray
whom by his tent th earthshaking god addressd
the voice assuming of andraemons son
who oer th ætolians as a god reverd
in pleuron reignd and lofty calydon

where now idomeneus sage cretan chief
are all the vaunting threats so freely pourd
against the trojans by the sons of greece

to whom the cretan king idomeneus
thoas on none so far as i may judge
may blame be cast we all our duties know
nor see i one by heartless fear restraind
nor hanging back and flinching from the war
yet by th oerruling will of saturns son
it seems decreed that here the greeks should fall
and far from argos lie in nameless graves
but thoas as thyself art ever staunch
nor slow the laggards to reprove thy work
remit not now but rouse each sevral man

to whom earthshaking neptune thus replied
idomeneus may he from troy return
no more but here remain to glut the dogs
if such there be from this days fight who shrinks
but haste thee don thine arms great need is now
to hasten if in aught we two may serve
een meaner men united courage gain
but we the bravest need not fear to meet

he said and to the strife of men returnd
within his wellconstructed tent arrivd
straight donnd idomeneus his armour bright
two spears he took and like the lightnings flash
which as a sign to men the hand of jove
hurls downwards from olympus glittring heights
whose dazzling radiance far around is thrown
flashd as the warrior ran his armour bright
him met meriones his follower brave
close to the tent to seek a spear he came
to whom idomeneus meriones
swiftfooted son of molus comrade dear
why comst thou here and leavst the battle field
hast thou some wound receivd whereof the pain
subdues thy spirit or comst thou to the field
to summon me unsummond well thou knowst
i better love the battle than the tent

whom answerd thus the sage meriones
idomeneus the brassclad cretans king
i come to seek a spear if haply such
within thy tent be found for in the fight
that which i lately bore een now i broke
against the shield of brave deiphobus

to whom idomeneus the cretan king
of spears or one or twenty if thou list
thou there mayst find against the polishd wall
the spoil of trojans slain for with my foes
tis not my wont to wage a distant war
thence have i store of spears and bossy shields
and crested helms and breastplates polishd bright

whom answerd thus the sage meriones
nor are my tent and darkribbd ship devoid
of trojan spoils but they are far to seek
nor deem i that my hand is slack in fight
for mid the foremost in the glorious strife
i stand wheneer is heard the battle cry
my deeds by others of the brassclad greeks
may not be noted but thou knowst them well

to whom idomeneus the cretan king
what need of this thy prowess well i know
for should we choose our bravest through the fleet
to man the secret ambush surest test
of warriors courage where is manifest
the diffrence twixt the coward and the brave

een there thy courage none might call in doubt
shouldst thou from spear or sword receive a wound
not on thy neck behind nor on thy back
would fall the blow but on thy breast in front
still pressing onward mid the foremost ranks
but come prolong we not this idle talk
like babblers vain who scorn might justly move
haste to my tent and there select thy spear

he said and from the tent meriones
valiant as mars his spear selected straight
and eager for the fray rejoind his chief
as mars the bane of men goes forth to war
attended by his strong unfearing son
terror who shakes the bravest warriors soul
they two from thrace against the ephyri
or haughty phlegyans arm nor hear alike
the prayrs of both the combatants one side
with victry crowning so to battle went
those leaders twain in dazzling arms arrayd
then thus meriones his chief addressd

son of deucalion say if on the right
or on the centre of the genral host
our onset should be made or on the left
for there methinks most succour need the greeks

to whom idomeneus the cretan chief
others there are the centre to defend
th ajaces both and teucer of the greeks
best archer good too in the standing fight
these may for hector full employment find
brave as he is and eager for the fray
een for his courage twere a task too hard
their might to conquer and resistless hands
and burn the ships if saturns son himself
fire not and mid the shipping throw the torch
great ajax telamon to none would yield
of mortal birth by earthly food sustaind
by spear or pondrous stone assailable
in hand to hand encounter scarce surpassd
by peleus son achilles though with him
in speed of foot he might not hope to vie
then on the left let us our onset make
and quickly learn if we on others heads
are doomd to win renown or they on ours

he said and brave as mars meriones
thither where he directed led the way
now when attended thus idomeneus
like blazing fire in dazzling arms appeard
around him throngd with rallying cries the greeks
and ragd beside the ships the balancd fight
as when the dust lies deepest on the roads
before the boistrous winds the storm drives fast
and high at once the whirling clouds are tossd
so was the fight confusd and in the throng
each man with keen desire of slaughter burnd
bristled the deadly strife with pondrous spears
wielded with dire intent the brazen gleam
dazzled the sight by flashing helmets cast
and breastplates polishd bright and glittring shields
commingling stern of heart indeed were he
who on that sight with joy not pain could gaze

dire evil then on mortal warriors brought
the diverse minds of saturns mighty sons
to hector and the trojans jove designd
in honour of achilles swift of foot
to give the victry yet not utterly
he willd to slay before the walls of troy
the grecian host but glory to confer
on thetis and her nobleminded son
neptune on th other side the greeks inspird
clandestine rising from the hoary sea
for them before the trojan host oerborne
he saw with grief and deeply wroth with jove
equal the rank of both their birth the same
but jove in wisdom as in years the first
nor venturd neptune openly to aid
the cause of greece but clothd in mortal form
in secret still the armys courage rousd
this way and that they tuggd of furious war
and balancd strife where many a warrior fell
the straining rope which none might break or loose
then though his hair was grizzld oer with age
calling the greeks to aid idomeneus
inspiring terror on the trojans sprang
and slew othryoneus who but of late
came from cabesus on the alarm of war
and welcomed as a guest in priams house
the fairest of his daughters sought to wed
no portion asked cassandra mighty deeds
he promisd from before the walls of troy
in their despite to drive the sons of greece
the aged priam listend to his snit
and he his promise trusting fought for troy
him marching with proud step idomeneus
struck with his glittring spear nor aught availd
his brazen breastplate through the middle thrust
thundring he fell the victor vaunting cried

othryoneus above all mortal men
i hold thee in respect if thou indeed
wilt make thy words to aged priam good
who promisd thee his daughter in return
we too would offer thee a like reward
and give thee here to wed from argos brought
atrides fairest daughter if with us
thou wilt oerthrow the wellbuilt walls of troy
come then on board our oceangoing ships
discuss the marriage contract nor shall we
be found illibral of our bridal gifts

he said and seizing by the foot the slain
draggd from the press but to the rescue came
asius himself on foot before his car
so close his charioteer the horses held
they breathd upon his shoulders eagerly
he sought to reach idomeneus but he
preventing through his gullet drove the spear
beneath his chin right through the weapon passd
he fell as falls an oak or poplar tall
or lofty pine which on the mountain top
for some proud ship the woodmans axe hath hewn
so he before the car and horses stretchd
his deathcry uttring clutchd the bloodstaind soil
bewilderd helpless stood his charioteer
nor dard escaping from the foemens hands
to turn his horses him antilochus
beneath the waistband struck nor aught availd
his brazen breastplate through the middle thrust
he from the wellwrought chariot gasping fell
antilochus the noble nestors son
the horses seizd and from the trojan ranks
drove to the grecian camp for asius death
deep grievd deiphobus approaching hurld
against idomeneus his glittring spear
the coming weapon he beheld and shunnd
beneath the ample circle of his shield
with hides and brazen plates encircled round
and by two rods sustaind conceald he stood
beneath he crouchd and oer him flew the spear
yet harsh it grated glancing from the shield
nor bootless from that stalwart hand it flew
but through the midriff close below the heart
hypsenor son of hippasus it struck
and straight relaxd his limbs then shouting loud
in boastful tone deiphobus exclaimd

not unavengd lies asius he methinks
as i have found him fellowship with joy
thro hades stronglyguarded gates may pass
he said the greeks indignant heard his boast
chief of antilochus the manly soul
was stirrd within him yet amid his grief
his comrade not forgetting up he ran
and oer him spread the cover of his shield
meanwhile two trusty friends mecistheus son
of echius and alastor raisd the slain
and deeply groaning bore him to the ships
nor did idomeneus his noble rage
abate still burning oer some trojan soul
to draw the gloomy veil of night and death
or having savd the greeks himself to fall
then highborn æsuetes son he slew
alcathous he anchises soninlaw
the eldest of his daughters had to wife
hippodamia by her parents both
oer all belovd in beauty skill and mind
all her compeers surpassing wife of one
the noblest man through all the breadth of troy
him neptune by idomeneus subdued
seald his quick eyes his active limbs restraind
without the powr to fly or shun the spear
fixd as a pillar or a lofty tree
he stood while through his breast idomeneus
his weapon drove the brazen mail it broke
which oft had turnd aside the stroke of death
harshly it grated severd by the spear
he fell the spearpoint quivring in his heart
which with convulsive throbbings shook the shaft
there mars its course arrested then with shouts
of triumph vaunting thus idomeneus

how now deiphobus are three for one
an equal balance where are now thy boasts
come forth my friend thyself to me opposd
and learn if here unworthy my descent
from jove my great progenitor i stand
he minos guardian chief of crete begot
noble deucalion was to minos born
i to deucalion far extends my rule
in widespread crete whom now our ships have brought
a bane to thee thy sire and trojans all

he said and doubtful stood deiphobus
or to retreat and summon to his aid
the trojans or alone the venture try
thus as he musd the wiser course appeard
to seek æneas him he found apart
behind the crowd for he was still at feud
with godlike priam who he thought withheld
the public honour to his valour due
to whom deiphobus approaching thus

æneas sagest councillor of troy
behoves thee now if revrence for the dead
can move thy soul thy sisters husband aid
haste we to save alcathous who of old
when thou wast little in thy fathers house
nursd thee with tender care for him but now
the spearrenownd idomeneus hath slain

he said æneas spirit was rousd and filld
with martial rage he sought idomeneus
nor cowardlike did he th encounter shun
but firmly stood as stands a mountainboar
selfconfident that in some lonely spot
awaits the clamrous chase bristles his back
his eyes with fire are flashing and his tusks
he whets on men and dogs prepard to rush
so stood the spearrenownd idomeneus
the onset of æneas swift in fight
awaiting and the friends he saw around
he summond to his aid ascalaphus
deipyrus and brave meriones
antilochus and aphareus to these
tried warriors all he thus addressed his speech

aid me my friends alone i stand and dread
the onset of æneas swift of foot
mighty to slay in battle and the bloom
of youth is his the crown of human strength
if as our spirit our years were but the same
great glory now should he or i obtain
he said and one in heart their bucklers slopd
upon their shoulders all beside him stood

on th other side æneas to his aid
summond his brother chiefs deiphobus
and paris and agenor following whom
came on the genral crowd as flocks of sheep
from pasture follow to their drinkingplace
the lordly ram well pleasd the shepherd sees
so pleasd æneas saw the gathring crowd
then oer alcathous hand to hand was wagd
the war of spears dire was the clash of brass
upon the heroes breasts as mid the press
each aimd at other proudly eminent
stood forth two mighty warriors terrible
as mars æneas and idomeneus
their sharp spears wielding each at others life
first at idomeneus æneas threw
his spear he saw and shunnd the brazen point
and vainly from his stalwart hand dismissd
æneas spear stood quivring in the ground
idomeneus in front below the waist
œnomaus struck the weighty spear broke through
the hollow breastplate and th intestines tore
prone in the dust he fell and clutchd the ground
forthwith idomeneus from out the corpse
the pondrous spear withdrew yet could not strip
his armour off so thickly flew the spears
nor did his feet retain their youthful force
his weapon to regain or back to spring
skilld in the standing fight his life to guard
he lackd the active powr of swift retreat
at him retiring slow deiphobus
still filld with anger threw his glittring spear
his aim he missd but through the shoulder piercd
ascalaphus a valiant son of mars
prone in the dust he fell and clutchd the ground
nor knew the loudvoicd mighty god of war
that in the stubborn fight his son had falln
on high olympus girt with golden clouds
he sat amid th immortals all restraind
by joves commands from mingling in the war
how hand to hand around ascalaphus
ragd the fierce conflict first deiphobus
from off his head the glittring helmet tore
but terrible as mars meriones
sprang forth and piercd his arm and from his hand
with hollow sound the crested helmet fell
on like a vulture sprang meriones
and from his arm the sturdy spear withdrew
then backward leapd amid his comrades ranks
while round his brothers waist polites threw
his arms and led him from the battlefield
to where with charioteer and richwrought car
beyond the fight his flying coursers stood
him rackd with pain and groaning while the blood
streamd down his wounded arm to troy they bore
the rest fought on and loud the tumult rose

æneas through the throat of aphareus
caletors son turnd sideways towrds him drove
his glittring spear and down on th other side
his shield and helmet following sank his head
and oer his eyes were cast the shades of death
as thoon turnd antilochus who watchd
th occasion forward sprang and with his spear
rippd all the flesh that lay along the spine
up to the neck he backward fell with hands
uplifted calling for his comrades aid
but forward sprang antilochus and tore
his armour from his breast while round he cast
his watchful glances for on evry side
on his broad shield the trojans showrd their blows
but touchd him not for neptune mid the throng
of weapons threw his guard oer nestors son
yet not aloof he stood but in their midst
commingled nor held motionless his spear
but ever threatning turnd from side to side
prepard to hurl or hand to hand engage
him adamas the son of asius marked
as oer the crowd he glancd and springing forth
struck with his spear the centre of the shield
but darkhaird neptune grudgd the heros life
and stayd the brazen point half in the shield
like a firehardend stake remained infixd
the other half lay broken on the ground
back to his comrades sheltring ranks he sprang
in hope of safety but meriones
quickfollowing plungd his weapon through his groin
where sharpest agony to wretched men
attends on death there planted he his spear
around the shaft he writhd and gasping groand
like to a mountain bull which bound with cords
the herdsmen drag along with struggles vain
resisting so the wounded warrior groand
but not for long for fierce meriones
approaching from his body tore the spear
and the dark shades of death his eyes oerspread
then helenus a weighty thracian sword
wielding aloft across the temples smote
deipyrus and all his helmet crashd
which as it rolld beneath their feet some greek
seizd mid the press his eyes were closd in death
the valiant menelaus atreus son
with grief beheld and royal helenus
with threatning mien approaching poisd on high
his glittring spear while he the bowstring drew
then simultaneous flew from either side
the gleaming spear and arrow from the string
the shaft of priams son below the breast
the hollow cuirass struck and bounded off
as bound the darkskinnd beans or clattring peas
from the broad fan upon the threshingfloor
by the brisk breeze impelld and winnowers force
from noble menelaus cuirass so
the stinging arrow bounding glancd afar
but valiant menelaus atreus son
transfixd the hand that held the polishd bow
the brazen point passd through and to the bow
the hand was pinnd back to his comrades ranks
he sprang in hope of safety hanging down
the wounded limb that traild the ashen spear
agenor from the wound the spear withdrew
and with a twisted sling of woollen cloth
by an attendant brought bound up the hand
to noble menelaus stood opposd
peisander to the confines dark of death
led by his evil fate by thee to fall
great son of atreus in the deadly strife
when near they drew atrides missd his aim
with erring spear divergent next his shield
peisander struck but drove not through the spear
for the broad shield resisted and the shaft
was snappd in sunder menelaus saw
rejoicing and with hope of triumph flushd
unsheathing then his silverstudded sword
rushd on peisander he beneath his shield
drew forth a pondrous brazen battleaxe
with handle long of polishd olivewood
and both at once in deadly combat joind
then just below the plume peisander struck
the crested helmets peak but atreus son
met him advancing and across the brow
smote him above the nose loud crashd the bone
and in the dust the gory eyeballs droppd
before him doubled with the pain he fell
the victor planting on his chest his foot
strippd off his arms and thus exulting cried
thus shall ye all insatiate of the fight
proud trojans from before our ships depart
nor lack your share of insult and of wrong
such as on me vile hounds ye cast erewhile
nor feard th avenger of the slighted laws
of hospitality high thundring jove
who soon your lofty city shall oerthrow
kindly receivd my virginwedded wife
with store of goods ye basely bore away
and now ye rage infuriate to destroy
with fire our oceangoing ships and slay
our grecian heroes but the time shall come
when ye too fain would from the war escape
o father jove tis said that thou excellst
in wisdom gods and men all human things
from thee proceed and can it be that thou
with favour seest these men of violence
these trojans with presumptuous courage filld
whose rage for the battle knows nor stint nor bound
men are with all things sated sleep and love
sweet sounds of music and the joyous dance
of these may some more gladly take their fill
but trojans still for war instiate thirst

thus menelaus and the bloodstained arms
strippd from the corpse and to his comrades gave
then joind again the foremost in the fray
there to th encounter forth harpalion sprang
son of the king pylaemenes who came
his father following to the war of troy
but back returnd not to his native land
he standing near full in the centre struck
atrides shield but drove not through the spear
back to his comrades sheltring ranks he sprang
in hopes of safety glancing all around
his body to defend but as he turnd
in his right flank a brazenpointed shaft
shot by meriones was buried deep
beneath the bone it passd and piercd him through
at once he fell and gasping out his life
amid his comrades writhing on the ground
like a crushd worm he lay and from the wound
the dark blood pouring drenchd the thirsty soil

the valiant troops of paphlagonia closd
around him on his car they placd the slain
and deeply sorrowing to the city bore
his father weeping walkd beside the car
nor vengeance for his slaughterd son obtaind
paris with grief and anger saw him fall
for he in former days his guest had been
in paphlagonia then with anger filld
a brasstippd arrow from his bow he sent

a certain man there was euchenor namd
who dwelt in corinth rich of blameless life
the son of polyeidus skilful seer
his fate well knowing he embarkd for oft
the good old man had told him that his doom
was or at home by sharp disease to die
or with the greeks by trojan hands to fall
embarking he escapd alike the fine
by greeks imposd and pangs of sharp disease
him paris smote between the ear and jaw
swift fled his spirit and darkness closd his eyes
thus ragd like blazing fire the furious fight

but nought as yet had hector heard nor knew
how sorely leftward of the ships were pressd
the trojans by the greeks and now appeard
their triumph sure such succour neptune gave
their courage rousing and imparting strength
but there he kept where first the serried ranks
of greeks he broke and stormd the wall and gates
there beachd beside the hoary sea the ships
of ajax and protesilaus lay
there had the wall been lowest built and there
were gatherd in defence the chiefest all
horses and men the stout bœotians there
joind to th ionians with their flowing robes
loerians and phthians and epeians proud
could scarce protect their ships nor could repel
th impetuous fire of godlike hectors charge
there too the choicest troops of athens fought
their chief menestheus peteus son with whom
were pheidas stichius bias in command
th epeians meges phyleus son obeyd
and dracius and amphion medon next
with brave podarces led the phthian host
medon the great oileus bastard son
brother of ajax he in phylace
far from his native land was drivn to dwell
since one to eriopis near akin
his sire oileus wife his hand had slain
podarces from iphiclus claimd his birth
the son of phylacus these two in arms
the valiant phthians leading to the fight
joind the bœotian troops to guard the ships
but from the side of ajax telamon
stirrd not a whit oileus active son
but as on fallowland with one accord
two darkred oxen drag the wellwrought plough
streaming with sweat that gathers round their horns
they by the polishd yoke together held
the stiff soil cleaving down the furrow strain
so closely side by side those two advancd
but comrades many and brave on telamon
attended who wheneer with toil and sweat
his limbs grew faint upheld his weighty shield
while in the fray oileus noble son
no locrians followd theirs were not the hearts
to brook th endurance of the standing fight
nor had they brassbound helms with horsehair plume
nor ample shields they bore nor ashen spear
but came to troy in bows and twisted slings
of woollen cloth confiding and from these
their bolts quickshowring broke the trojan ranks
while those in front in glittring arms opposd
the men of troy by noble hector led
these in the rear unseen their arrows shot
nor stood the trojans for amid their ranks
the galling arrows dire confusion spread
then had the trojans from the ships and tents
back to the breezy heights of troy been drivn
in flight disastrous but polydamas
drew near to hector and addressd him thus

hector i know thee how unapt thou art
to hearken to advice because the gods
have givn thee to excel in warlike might
thou deemest thyself in counsel too supreme
yet every gift thou canst not so combine
to one the gods have granted warlike might
to one the dance to one the lyre and song
while in anothers breast allseeing jove
hath placd the spirit of wisdom and a mind
discerning for the common good of all
by him are states preservd and he himself
best knows the value of the precious gift
then hear what seems to me the wisest course
on evry side the circling ring of war
is blazing all around thee and thou seest
our valiant trojans since the wall they scald
or stand aloof or scatterd mid the ships
outnumberd with superior forces strive
then thou retiring hither call the chiefs
here take we counsel fully if to fall
upon their wellmannd ships should heaven vouchsafe
the needful strength or scatheless yet withdraw
for much i fear they soon will pay us back
their debt of yesterday since in their ranks
one yet remains insatiate of the fight
and he methinks not long will stand aloof

thus he the prudent counsel hector pleasd
down from his chariot with his arms he leapd
and to polydamas his speech addressd

polydamas detain thou here the chiefs
thither will i and meet the front of war
and givn my orders quickly here return

he said and like a snowclad mountain high
uprose and loudly shouting in hot haste
flew through the trojan and confedrate host
at sound of hectors voice round panthous son
polydamas were gatherd all the chiefs
but mid the foremost combatants he sought
if haply he might find deiphobus
and royal helenus and adamas
and gallant asius son of hyrtacus
these found he not unscathd by wounds or death
for some beside the ships of greece had paid
by grecian hands the forfeit of their lives
while others wounded lay within the wall
but to the leftward of the bloody fray
the godlike paris fairhaird helens lord
cheering his comrades to the fight he found
and with reproachful words addressd him thus

thou wretched paris fair in outward form
thou slave of woman manhoods counterfeit
where is deiphobus and where the might
of royal helenus where adamas
the son of asius where too asius son
of hyrtacus and where othryoneus
now from its summit totters to the fall
our lofty ilium now thy doom is sure

to whom the godlike paris thus replied
hector since blameless i incur thy blame
neer have i less withdrawn me from the fight
and me not wholly vile my mother bore
for since thou gavst command to attack the ships
we here against the greeks unflinching war
have wagd our comrades whom thou seekst are slain
only deiphobus hath left the field
and helenus both wounded by the spear
both through the hand but jove their life hath spard
but thou whereer thy courage bids lead on
we shall be prompt to follow to our powr
thou shalt in us no lack of valour find
beyond his powr the bravest cannot fight

wrought on his brothers mind the heros words
together both they bent their steps where ragd
the fiercest conflict there cebriones
phalces orthaeus brave polydamas
palmys and godlike polyphetes might
and morys and ascanius fought these two
hippotions sons from rich ascanias plains
they as reliefs but yestermorn had come
impelld by jove they sought the battle field
onward they dashd impetuous as the rush
of the fierce whirlwind which with lightning chargd
from father jove sweeps downward oer the plain
as with loud roar it mingles with the sea
the manydashing oceans billows boil
upheaving foamwhitecrested wave on wave
so rank on rank the trojans closely massd
in arms all glittring with their chiefs advancd
hector the son of priam led them on
in combat terrible as bloodstaind mars
before his breast his shields broad orb he bore
of hides close joind with brazen plates oerlaid
the gleaming helmet nodded oer his brow
he with proud step protected by his shield
on evry side the hostile ranks surveyd
if signs of yielding he might trace but they
unshaken stood and with like haughty mien
ajax at hector thus defiance hurld

draw nearer mighty chief why seek to scare
our valiant greeks we boast ourselves of war
not wholly unskilld though now the hand of jove
lies heavy on us with the scourge of heavn
thou hopst forsooth our vessels to destroy
but stalwart arms for their defence we boast
long ere that day shall your proud city fall
takn and destroyd by our victorious hands
not far the hour when thou thyself in flight
to jove and all the gods shalt make thy prayr
that swifter than the falcons wing thy steeds
may bear thee oer the dusty plain to troy

thus as he spoke upon his right appeard
an eagle soaring high the crowd of greeks
the favring omen saw and shouted loud
then noble hector thus what words are these
ajax thou babbling braggart vain of speech
for would to heavn i were as well assurd
i were the son of aegisbearing jove
born of imperial juno and myself
in equal honour with apollo held
or blueeyd pallas as i am assurd
this day is fraught with ill to all the greeks
thou mid the rest shalt perish if thou dare
my spear encounter which thy dainty skin
shall rend and slain beside the ships thy flesh
shall glut the dogs and carrion birds of troy

he said and led them on with eager cheers
they followed shouted loud the hindmost throng
on th other side the greeks returnd the shout
of all the trojans bravest they unmovd
the onset bore their mingled clamours rose
to heavn and reachd the glorious light of jove





nor did the battledin not reach the ears
of nestor oer the winecup and his speech
he thus addressd to æsculapius son

say good machaon what these sounds may mean
for louder swells the tumult round the ships
but sit thou here and drink the ruddy wine
till fairhaird hecamede shall prepare
the gentle bath and wash thy gory wounds
while i go forth and all around survey

he said and from the wall a buckler took
wellwrought with brass resplendent which his son
brave thrasymedes in the tent had left
while with his fathers shield himself was girt
a sturdy spear too tippd with brass he took
without the tent he stood and there his eyes
a woful sight beheld the greeks in flight
the haughty trojans pressing on their rout
confusd the greeks protecting wall oerthrown
as heaves the darkling sea with silent swell
expectant of the boistrous gales approach
nor onward either way is pourd its flood
until it feel th impelling blast from heavn
so stood th old man his mind perplexd with doubt
to mingle in the throng or counsel seek
of mighty agamemnon atreus son
thus as he mused the better course appeard
to seek atrides fiercely fought the rest
with mutual slaughter loud their armour rang
with thrusts of swords and doublepointed spears
there nestor met advancing from the ships
the heavnborn kings ulysses diomed
and agamemnon son of atreus all
by wounds disabled for the ships were beachd
upon the shore beside the hoary sea
far from the battle higher towrd the plain
the foremost had been drawn and with a wall
their sterns surrounded for the spacious beach
could not contain them and in narrow bounds
were pent their multitudes so high on land
they drew and rangd them side by side and filld
within the headlands all the widemouthd bay
thus they their steps supporting on their spears
together came spectators of the fight
deep sorrow filld their breasts them nestor met
the fear increasing which their souls possessd
to whom the monarch agamemnon thus

o nestor son of neleus pride of greece
why comst thou here and leavst the battlefield
greatly i fear that noble hector now
his menace will fulfil who made his boast
before th assembled trojans that to troy
he never would return until our ships
the flames had masterd and ourselves the sword
such was his threat and now he makes it good
heavn can it be that i of other greeks
as of achilles have incurrd the wrath
who thence refuse to battle for the ships

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied
such are indeed our prospects jove on high
could to our fortunes give no diffrent turn
the wall is razd wherein our trust we placd
to guard impregnable ourselves and ships
and now around the ships their war they wage
unceasing unabated none might tell
by closest scrutiny which way are drivn
the routed greeks so intermixd they fall
promiscuous and the cry ascends to heavn
but come discuss we what may best be done
if judgment aught may profit us ourselves
to mingle in the fray i counsel not
it were not well for wounded men to fight

whom answerd agamemnon king of men
nestor since to the ships the war is brought
nor hath the wall availd to stay their course
nor yet the deepdug trench on which we greeks
much toil bestowd and which we vainly hopd
might guard impregnable ourselves and ships
seems it the will of saturns mighty son
that far from argos from our native land
we all should here in nameless graves be laid
i knew when once he lovd to aid the greeks
but now i see that to the blessed gods
our foes he equals and our strength confounds
hear then my counsel let us all agree
the ships that nearest to the sea are beachd
to launch upon the main till nightfall there
to ride at anchor if that een by night
the trojans may suspend their fierce assault
then may we launch in safety all the fleet
no shame it is to fly although by night
impending evil better so to fly
than by the threatend danger be oertaen

to whom with scornful glance ulysses sage
what words have passd the barrier of thy lips
thou son of atreus counsellor of ill
would thou hadst been of some ignoble band
the leader not the chief of such a host
as ours on whom from youth to latest age
jove hath the gift bestowd to bear the brunt
of hardy war till evry man be slain
and thinkst thou so to leave the lofty walls
of troy the object of our painful toil
be silent that no other greek may hear
words which no man might trust his tongue to speak
who nobler counsels understands and wields
a royal sceptre and th allegiance claims
of numbers such as those that own thy sway
thy counsels all i utterly condemn
who mid the close and clamour of the fight
wouldst have us launch our ships and give the foe
already too triumphant cause renewd
for boasting then were death our certain lot
for if the ships he launchd not long will greeks
sustain the war but with reverted eyes
shrink from the fight to such pernicious end
would lead thy baneful counsels mighty chief

whom answerd agamemnon king of men
ulysses thy rebuke hath wrung my soul
yet never meant i that against their will
the sons of greece should launch their well found ships
but if there be who better counsel knows
or young or old his words would please me well

then rose the valiant diomed and said
the man is near at hand nor far to seek
if ye will hear nor take offence that i
the youngest of you all presume to speak
yet of a noble sire i boast me sprung
tydeus who sleeps beneath the theban soil
to portheus three brave sons were born who dwelt
in pleuron and in lofty calydon
agrius and melas bravest of them all
my fathers father œneus was the third
he there remaind my father wandring long
to argos came such was the will of jove
and of th immortals all he there espousd
adrastus daughter ownd a wealthy house
with fertile cornlands round and orchards stord
with goodly fruittrees numrous flocks he had
and all the greeks in feats of arms excelld
hear ye the words i speak for they are true
and if my speech be wise despise it not
as of one worthless or ignobly born
though wounded to the battle i advise
that we perforce repair yet not ourselves
to join the combat or confront the spears
lest wounds to wounds be added but to rouse
the spirits of some who zealous heretofore
how stand aloof nor mingle in the fray

he said and they his words approving went
by agamemnon led the king of men
nor careless was the watch by neptune kept
with them in likeness of an aged man
he went and agamemnon atreus son
by the right hand he took and thus addressd

o son of atreus great is now the joy
with which achilles savage breast is filld
who sees the slaughter and the rout of greeks
for nought he has of heart no not a whit
but perish he accursed of the gods
nor deem thou that to thee the blessed gods
are wholly hostile yet again the chiefs
and councillors of troy shall scour in flight
the dusty plain and from the ships and tents
thine eyes shall see them to the city fly

he said and loudly shouting onward rushd
as of nine thousand or ten thousand men
in deadly combat meeting is the shout
such was the sound which from his ample chest
th earthshaker sent and evry greek inspird
with stern resolve to wage unflinching war

standing on high olympus topmost peak
the goldenthroned juno downward lookd
and busied in the glorygiving strife
her husbands brother and her own she saw
saw and rejoicd next seated on the crest
of springabounding ida jove she saw
sight hateful in her eyes then ponderd deep
the stageyd queen how best she might beguile
the wakeful mind of aegisbearing jove
and musing this appeard the readiest mode
herself with art adorning to repair
to ida there with fondest blandishment
and female charm her husband to enfold
in loves embrace and gentle careless sleep
around his eyelids and his senses pour
her chamber straight she sought by vulcan built
her son by whom were to the doorposts hung
closefitting doors with secret keys securd
that save herself no god might enter in
there enterd she and closd the shining doors
and with ambrosia first her lovely skin
she purified with fragrant oil anointing
ambrosial breathing forth such odours sweet
that wavd above the brazen floor of jove
all earth and heavn were with the fragrance filld
oer her fair skin this precious oil she spread
combd out her flowing locks and with her hand
wreathd the thick masses of the glossy hair
immortal bright that crownd th imperial head
a robe ambrosial then by pallas wrought
she donnd in many a curious pattern tracd
with golden brooch beneath her breast confind
her zone from which a hundred tassels hung
she girt about her and in three bright drops
her glittring gems suspended from her ears
and all around her grace and beauty shone
then oer her head th imperial goddess threw
a beauteous veil newwrought as sunlight white
and on her wellturnd feet her sandals bound
her dress completed from her chamber forth
she issued and from th other gods apart
she calld to venus and addressd her thus
say wilt thou grant dear child the boon i ask
or wilt thou say me nay in wrath that i
espouse the greek as thou the trojan cause

to whom the laughterloving venus thus
daughter of saturn juno mighty queen
tell me thy wish to grant it if my powr
may aught avail thy pleasure shall be done

to whom great juno thus with artful speech
give me the loveliness and powr to charm
whereby thou reignst oer gods and men supreme
for to the bounteous earths extremest bounds
i go to visit old oceanus
the sire of gods and tethys who of yore
from rhaea took me when allseeing jove
hurld saturn down below the earth and seas
and nursd me in their home with tendrest care
i go to visit them and reconcile
a lengthend feud for since some cause of wrath
has come between them they from rites of love
and from the marriagebed have long abstaind
could i unite them by persuasive words
and to their former intercourse restore
their love and revrence were for ever mine

whom answerd thus the laughterloving queen
i ought not and i cannot say thee nay
who liest encircled by the arms of jove

thus venus spoke and from her bosom loosd
her broiderd cestus wrought with evry charm
to win the heart there love there young desire
there fond discourse and there persuasion dwelt
which oft enthralls the mind of wisest men
this in her hand she placd as thus she spoke
take thou from me and in thy bosom hide
this broiderd cestus and whateer thy wish
thou shalt not here ungratified return

thus venus smild the stageyd queen of heavn
and smiling in her bosom hid the gift
then venus to her fathers house returnd
but juno down from high olympus sped
oer sweet emathia and pierias range
oer snowy mountains of horsebreeding thrace
their topmost heights she soard nor touchd the earth
from athos then she crossd the swelling sea
until to lemnos godlike thoas seat
she came there met she sleep twinborn with death
whom as his hand she claspd she thus addressd

sleep universal king of gods and men
if ever thou hast listend to my voice
grant me the boon which now i ask and win
my ceaseless favour in all time to come
when jove thou seest in my embraces lockd
do thou his piercing eyes in slumber seal
rich guerdon shall be thine a gorgeous throne
immortal golden which my skilful son
vulcan shall deftly frame beneath a stool
whereon at feasts thy feet may softly rest

whom answerd thus the gentle god of sleep
daughter of saturn juno mighty queen
on any other of th immortal gods
i can with ease exert my slumbrous powr
even to the stream of old oceanus
prime origin of all but saturns son
imperial jove i dare not so approach
nor sink in sleep save by his own desire
already once obeying thy command
a fearful warning i receivd that day
when from the capture and the sack of troy
that mighty warrior son of jove set sail
for circumfusd around with sweet constraint
i bound the sense of aegisbearing jove
while thou with illdesign rousing the force
of winds tempestuous oer the stormy sea
didst cast him forth on coos thriving isle
far from his friends then jove awaking pourd
his wrath promiscuous on th assembled gods
me chief his anger sought and from on high
had hurld me plungd beneath th unfathomd sea
but night the vanquisher of gods and men
her fugitive received me he his wrath
repressd unwilling to invade the claims
of holy night and now thou fain wouldst urge
that i another reckless deed essay

whom answerd thus the stageyd queen of heavn
why sleep with thoughts like these perplex thy mind
thinkst thou that jove as ardently desires
to aid the men of troy as fiercely burnd
his anger on his valiant sons behalf
grant my request and of the graces one
the youngest and the fairest have to wife
pasithea whom thy love hath long pursued

thus promisd juno sleep rejoicing heard
and answerd thus swear then the awful oath
inviolable by the stream of styx
thy one hand laid upon the fruitful earth
the other resting on the sparkling sea
that all the gods who in the nether realms
with saturn dwell may of our solemn bond
be witnesses that of the graces one
the youngest fairest i shall have to wife
pasithea whom my love hath long pursued

he said nor did the whitearmd queen refuse
she took the oath requird and calld by name
on all the titans subtartarean gods
then sworn and ratified the oath they passd
from lemnos and from imbros veild in cloud
skimming their airy way on lectum first
in springabounding ida nurse of beasts
the sea they left and journeyd oer the land
while wavd beneath their feet the lofty woods
there sleep ere yet he met the eye of jove
remaind and mounted on a lofty pine
the tallest growth of ida that on high
flung through the desert air its boughs to heavn
amid the pines close branches lay ensconcd
like to a mountain bird of shrillest note
whom gods the chalcis men the nighthawk call
juno meanwhile to idas summit sped
to gargarus the cloudcompeller saw
he saw and sudden passion fird his soul
as when their parents eyes eluding first
they tasted of the secret joys of love
he rose to meet her and addressd her thus

from high olympus juno whither bound
and how to ida hast thou come in haste
for horses here or chariot hast thou none

to whom thus juno with deceitful speech
replied to fertile earths extremest bounds
i go to visit old oceanus
the sire of gods and tethys who of yore
receivd and nurturd me with tendrest care
i go to visit them and reconcile
a lengthend feud for since some cause of wrath
has come between them they from rites of love
and from the marriagebed have long abstaind
meanwhile at springabounding idas foot
my horses wait me that oer land and sea
alike my chariot bear on thine account
from high olympus hither have i come
lest it displease thee if to thee unknown
i sought the oceans deeplyflowing stream
to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
juno thy visit yet awhile defer
and let us now in loves delights indulge
for never yet did such a flood of love
for goddess or for mortal fill my soul
not for ixions beauteous wife who bore
pirithous sage in council as the gods
nor the neatfooted maiden danae
acrisius daughter her who perseus bore
th observd of all nor noble phoenix child
who bore me minos and the godlike might
of rhadamanthus nor for semele
nor for alcmena fair of whom was born
in thebes the mighty warrior hercules
as bacchus joy of men of semele
no nor for ceres goldentressed queen
nor for latona bright nor for thyself
as now with fond desire for thee i burn

to whom thus juno with deceitful speech
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
if here on ida in the face of day
we celebrate the mystic rites of love
how if some other of th immortal gods
should find us sleeping and mid all the gods
should spread the tale abroad i could not then
straight to thy house for very shame return
but if indeed such passion fill thy soul
thou hast thy secret chamber built for thee
by vulcan with closefitting doors securd
thither if such thy pleasure go we now

to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
juno nor fear the eye of god or man
for all around us i will throw such veil
of golden cloud that not the sun himself
with sharpest beam of light may pierce it through

thus saying in his arms he claspd his wife
the teeming earth beneath them causd to spring
the tender grass and lotus dewbesprent
crocus and hyacinth a fragrant couch
profuse and soft upspringing from the earth
there lay they all around them spread a veil
of golden cloud whence heavnly dews distilld
there on the topmost height of gargarus
by sleep and love subdued th immortal sire
claspd in his arms his wife reposd in peace

then sleep arose and to the grecian ships
in haste repairing to th earthshaking king
his tidings bore and standing at his side
thus to the god his winged words addressd

now neptune to the greeks thy ready aid
afford that shortlivd triumph they may gain
while slumber holds the eyes of jove for i
in sweet unconsciousness have drownd his sense
beguild by juno in whose arms he lies

he said and vanishd mid the tribes of men
but fird with keener zeal to aid the greeks
neptune sprang forth in front and calld aloud

again ye greeks shall our remissness yield
the victory to hector priams son
to seize our ships and endless glory gain
such is his boast and menace since in wrath
achilles still beside his ships remains
yet him we scarce should miss if we the rest
but firmly stood for mutual defence
hear then my counsel let us all agree
girt with our best and broadest shields our heads
with flashing helmets guarded in our hands
grasping our longest spears to dare the fight
myself will lead you on and priams son
though bold he be will fear with me to cope
and if among our bravest any bear
too small a buckler with some meaner man
let him exchange and don the larger shield

he said and they assenting heard his speech
the kings themselves ulysses diomed
and mighty agamemnon atreus son
though sorely wounded yet the troops arrayd
throout the ranks they passd and changd the arms
the bravest donnd the best the worse the worst
when with their dazzling armour all were girt
forward they movd th earthshaker led them on
in his broad hand an awful sword he bore
longbladed vivid as the lightnings flash
yet in the deadly strife he might not join
but kindled terror in the minds of men

hector meantime the trojan troops arrayd
then fiercer grew and more intense the strain
of furious fight when oceans darkhaird king
and priams noble son were met in arms
and aided this the trojans that the greeks
high towrd the tents uprose the surging sea
as with loud clamour met th opposing hosts
less loud the roar of oceans wave that drivn
by stormy boreas breaks upon the beach
less loud the crackling of the flames that rage
in the deep forest of some mountain glen
less loud the wind to wildest fury rousd
howls in the branches of the lofty oaks
than rose the cry of trojans and of greeks
as each with furious shout encounterd each
at ajax first who straight before him stood
great hector threw his spear nor missd his aim
where the two belts the one which bore his shield
his silverstudded sword the other met
across his breast these two his life preservd
hector was wroth that from his stalwart hand
the spear had flown in vain and back he sprang
for safety to his comrades sheltring ranks
but mighty ajax telamon upheavd
a pondrous stone of many all around
that scatterd lay beneath the warriors feet
and servd to prop the ships with one of these
as hector backward steppd above the shield
he smote him on the breast below the throat
with whirling motion circling as it flew
the mass he hurld as by the bolt of heavn
uprooted prostrate lies some forest oak
the sulphrous vapour taints the air appalld
bereft of strength the near beholder stands
and awestruck hears the thunderpeal of jove
so in the dust the might of hector lay
droppd from his hand the spear the shield and helm
fell with him loud his polished armour rang
on rushd with joyous shout the sons of greece
in hope to seize the spoil thick flew the spears
yet none might reach or wound the fallen chief
for gatherd close around the bravest all
valiant æneas and polydamas
godlike agenor and the lycian chief
sarpedon and the noble glaucus stood
nor did the rest not aid their shields broad orbs
before him still they held while in their arms
his comrades bore him from the battlefield
to where with charioteer and wellwrought car
beyond the fight his flying coursers stood
which bore him deeply groaning towrd the town
but when the ford was reachd of xanthus stream
broadflowing eddying by immortal jove
begotten on the ground they laid him down
and dashd the cooling water on his brow
revivd he lifted up awhile his eyes
then on his knees half rising he disgorgd
the clotted blood but backward to the earth
still by the blow subdud again he fell
and darkling shades of night his eyes oerspread

onward with zeal redoubled pressd the greeks
when hector from the field they saw withdrawn
foremost of all oileus active son
with sudden spring assailing satnius slew
him a fair naiad nymph to œnops bore
who by the banks of satnois kept his herds
him then approaching near oileus son
thrust through the flank he fell and oer his corpse
trojans and greeks in stubborn fight engagd
but panthous son a swift avenger came
polydamas with brandishd spear and struck
through the right shoulder prothoenor son
of areilycus right through was drivn
the sturdy spear he rolling in the dust
clutchd with his palms the ground then shouting loud
thus with triumphant boast polydamas

from the strong hand of panthous noble son
methinks that not in vain the spear has flown
a greek now bears it off and he perchance
may use it as a staff to plutos realm

thus he the greeks with pain his vaunting heard
but chief it rousd the spirit within the breast
of ajax telamon whom close beside
the dead had falln he at polydamas
retreating hurld in haste his glittring spear
he springing sideways scapd the stroke of fate
but young archilochus antenors son
receivd the spear for heavn had willd his death
the spine it struck the topmost joint where met
the head and neck and both the tendons broke
forward he fell and ere or knee or leg
his head and mouth and nostrils struck the ground

then ajax in his turn exulting thus
say now polydamas and tell me true
may this be deemd for prothoenors death
a full equivalent no common man
he seems and born of no ignoble race
valiant antenors brother or perchance
his son the likeness speaks him near akin

thus he though well he knew then bitter grief
possessd the trojans souls but acamas
guarding his brothers body with his spear
slew the bœotian promachus who fain
would by the feet have drawn away the dead
then acamas exulting cried aloud

ye wretched greeks in boasting measureless
not ours alone the labour and the loss
of battle ye too have your share of death
behold where lies your promachus subdued
beneath my spear not long unpaid the debt
due for my brothers blood tis well for him
who leaves a brother to avenge his fate

thus he the greeks with pain his vaunting heard
but chief it rousd the spirit within the breast
of peneleus on acamas he sprang
who waited not th encounter next he slew
ilioneus the son of phorbas lord
of numrous flocks of all the trojans most
belovd of hermes who his wealth increasd
to him ilioneus an only son
his mother bore who now beneath the brow
and through the socket of the eye was struck
thrusting the eyeball out for through the eye
and backward through the head the spear was drivn
with hands extended down to earth he sank
but peneleus his weighty sword let fall
full on his neck the severd head and helm
together fell remaining still infixd
the sturdy spear then he the gory head
uplifting to the trojans vaunting cried

go now ye trojans bid that in the house
of brave ilioneus his parents raise
the voice of wailing for their gallant son
as neither shall the wife of promachus
the son of alegenor with glad smile
her husbands coming hail when home from troy
we sons of greece with victry crownd return

thus as he spoke pale fear possessd them all
each looking round to seek escape from death

say now ye nine who on olympus dwell
who when th earthshaker turnd the tide of war
first bore away his foemans bloody spoils

great ajax telamon first hyrtius smote
the son of gyrtius who to battle led
the warlike mysians next antilochus
from mermerus and phalces strippd their arms
meriones hippotion gave to death
and morys teucer periphetes slew
and prothoon menelaus through the flank
smote hyperenor as the grinding spear
draind all his vitals through the gaping wound
his spirit escapd and darkness closd his eyes
but chiefest slaughter of the trojans wrought
oileus active son of all the greeks
no foot so swift as his when jove had filld
their souls with fear to chase the flying foe





now when the trojans had recrossd the trench
and palisades and in their headlong flight
many had falln by grecian swords the rest
routed and pale with fear made head awhile
beside their cars then jove on idas height
at goldenthroned junos side awoke
rising he saw the trojans and the greeks
those in confusion while behind them pressd
the greeks triumphant neptune in their midst
he saw too hector stretchd upon the plain
his comrades standing round senseless he lay
drawing short breath blood gushing from his mouth
for by no feeble hand the blow was dealt

pitying the sire of gods and men beheld
and thus with sternest glance to juno spoke
this juno is thy work thy wicked wiles
have hector quelld and trojans drivn to flight
nor know i but thyself mayst reap the fruit
by shameful scourging of thy vile deceit
hast thou forgotten how in former times
i hung thee from on high and to thy feet
attachd two pondrous anvils and thy hands
with golden fetters bound which none might break
there didst thou hang amid the clouds of heavn
through all olympus breadth the gods were wroth
yet dard not one approach to set thee free
if any so had venturd him had i
hurld from heavns threshold till to earth he fell
with little left of life yet was not quenchd
my wrath on godlike hercules account
whom thou with boreas oer the watry waste
with fell intent didst send and tempesttossd
cast him ashore on coos fruitful isle
i rescued him from thence and brought him back
after long toil to argos grassy plains
this to thy mind i bring that thou mayst learn
to cease thy treachrous wiles nor hope to gain
by all thy lavishd blandishments of love
wherewith thou hast deceived me and betrayd

he said and terror seizd the stageyd queen
who thus with winged words addressd her lord

by earth i swear and yon broad heavn above
and stygian stream beneath the weightiest oath
of solemn powr to bind the blessed gods
by thine own sacred head our nuptial bed
whose holy tie i never could forswear
that not by my suggestion and advice
earthshaking neptune on the trojan host
and hector pours his wrath and aids the greeks
in this he but obeys his own desire
who looks with pity on the grecian host
beside their ships oerborne and could my words
prevail my counsel were to shape his course
o cloudgirt king obedient to thy will

she said the sire of gods and men well pleasd
her answer heard and thus with gracious smile

if stageyd queen in synod of the gods
thy counsels shall indeed with mine agree
neptune how strong soeer his wish must change
his course obedient to thy will and mine
and if in all sincerity thou speak
go to th assembled gods and hither send
iris and phoebus of the silver bow
that she may to the grecian camp repair
and bid that neptune from the battlefield
withdraw and to his own domain retire
while phoebus hector to the fight restores
inspiring newborn vigour and allaying
the mortal pains which bow his spirit down
then heartless fear infusing in the greeks
put them to flight that flying they may fall
beside achilles ships his comrade then
patroclus he shall send to battle forth
to be by hector slain in front of troy
yet not to fall till many valiant youths
have felt his prowess and amid the rest
my son sarpedon by his comrades death
enragd achilles hector shall subdue
thenceforth my counsel is that from the ships
the trojan force shall still be backward drivn
until at length by pallas deep designs
the greeks possess the lofty walls of troy
yet will not i my anger intermit
nor suffer other of th immortal gods
to aid the greeks till peleus son behold
his wish accomplishd and the boon obtaind
i promisd once and with a nod confirmd
that day when seaborn thetis claspd my knees
and prayd me to avenge her warrior son

thus he the whitearmd queen of heavn submiss
his mandate heard and from th idaean mount
with rapid flight to high olympus sped
swift as the mind of man who many a land
hath travelld oer and with reflective thought
recalls here was i such a day or here
and in a moment many a scene surveys
so juno sped oer intervening space
olympus heights she reachd and in the house
of jove appeard amid th assembled gods
they at her coming rose with golden cups
greeting their queens approach the rest she passd
and from the hand of fairfacd themis took
the profferd cup who first had run to meet
and thus with winged words addressd the queen
juno why comst thou hither and with looks
of one distraught with fear hath saturns son
thy mighty lord thus sore affrighted thee
to whom the whitearmd goddess juno thus

forbear thy questions themis well thou knowst
how haughty and imperious is his mind
thou for the gods in haste prepare the feast
then shalt thou learn amid th immortals all
what evil he designs nor all i ween
his counsels will approve or men or gods
though now in blissful ignorance they feast

she said and sat the gods oppressd with care
her farther speech awaited on her lips
there dwelt indeed a smile but not a ray
passd oer her darkning brow as thus her wrath
amid th assembled gods found vent in words

fools are we all who madly strive with jove
or hope by access to his throne to sway
by word or deed his course from all apart
he all our counsels heeds not but derides
and boasts oer all th immortal gods to reign
in unapproachd preeminence of powr
prepare then each his sevral woe to bear
on mars een now methinks the blow hath falln
since in the fight the man he loves the best
and boasts his son ascalaphus is slain
she said and mars enragd his brawny thigh
smote with his hands and thus lamenting spoke

blame not ye gods who on olympus dwell
that to the grecian ships i haste to avenge
my slaughterd son though blasted by heavns fire
twere mine mid corpses blood and dust to lie

he said and gave command to fear and flight
to yoke his car and donnd his glittring arms
then from the throne of jove had heavier wrath
and deeper vengeance on th immortals falln
but pallas in alarm for all the gods
quitting in haste the throne whereon she sat
sprang past the vestibule and from his head
the helmet lifted from his arm the shield
took from his sturdy hand and reard upright
the brazen spear then with reproachful words
she thus assaild th impetuous god of war

frantic and passionmaddened thou art lost
hast thou no ears to hear or are thy mind
and sense of revrence utterly destroyed
or heardst thou not what whitearmd juno spoke
fresh from the presence of olympian jove
wouldst thou thine evil destiny fulfilld
by hard constraint despite thy grief be drivn
back to olympus and to all the rest
confusion and disaster with thee bring
at once from valiant trojans and from greeks
his thoughts would be diverted and his wrath
embroil olympus and on all alike
guilty or not his anger would be pourd
waive then thy vengeance for thy gallant son
others as brave of heart as strong of arm
have falln and yet must fall and vain th attempt
to watch at once oer all the race of men

thus saying to his seat again she forcd
th impetuous mars meanwhile without the house
juno by joves command apollo calld
and iris messenger from god to god
and thus to both her winged words addressd

jove bids you with all speed to ida haste
and when arrivd before his face ye stand
whateer he orders that observe and do

thus juno spoke and to her throne returnd
while they to springabounding idas heights
wild nurse of forest beasts pursued their way
th allseeing son of saturn there they found
upon the topmost crag of gargarus
an incensebreathing cloud around him spread
before the face of cloudcompelling jove
they stood wellpleasd he witnessd their approach
in swift obedience to his consorts words
and thus to iris first his speech addressd

haste thee swift iris and to oceans king
my message bear nor misreporting aught
nor aught omitting from the battlefield
bid him retire and join th assembled gods
or to his own domain of sea withdraw
if my commands he heed not nor obey
let him consider in his inmost soul
if mighty though he be he dare await
my hostile coming mightier far than him
his elder born nor may his spirit aspire
to rival me whom all regard with awe

he said swiftfooted iris at the word
from idas heights to sacred ilium sped
swift as the snowflakes from the clouds descend
or wintry hail before the driving blast
of boreas etherborn so swift to earth
descended iris by his side she stood
and with these words th earthshaking god addressd
a message darkhaird circler of the earth
to thee i bring from ægisbearing jove
he bids thee straightway from the battlefield
retire and either join th assembled gods
or to thine own domain of sea withdraw
if his commands thou heed not nor obey
hither he menaces himself to come
and fight against thee but he warns thee first
beware his arm as mightier far than thee
thine elder born nor may thy spirit aspire
to rival him whom all regard with awe

to whom in towring wrath th earthshaking god
by heavn though great he be he yet presumes
somewhat too far if me his equal born
he seeks by force to baffle of my will
we were three brethren all of rhaea born
to saturn jove and i and pluto third
who oer the nether regions holds his sway
threefold was our partition each obtaind
his meed of honour due the hoary sea
by lot my habitation was assignd
the realms of darkness fell to plutos share
broad heavn amid the sky and clouds to jove
but earth and high olympus are to all
a common heritage nor will i walk
to please the will of jove though great he be
with his own third contented let him rest
nor let him think that i as wholly vile
shall quail before his arm his lofty words
were better to his daughters and his sons
addressd his own begotten who perforce
must listen to his mandates and obey

to whom swiftfooted iris thus replied
is this then darkhaird circler of the earth
the message stern and haughty which to jove
thou biddst me bear perchance thine angry mood
may bend to better counsels noblest minds
are easiest bent and oer superior age
thou knowst th avenging furies ever watch

to whom earthshaking neptune thus replied
immortal iris weighty are thy words
and in good season spoken and tis well
when envoys are by sound discretion led
yet are my heart and mind with grief oppressd
when me his equal both by birth and fate
he seeks with haughty words to overbear
i yield but with indignant sense of wrong
this too i say nor shall my threat be vain
let him remember if in my despite
gainst pallas junos hermes vulcans will
he spare to overthrow proud iliums towrs
and crown with victory the grecian arms
the feud between us never can be heald

th earthshaker said and from the field withdrew
beneath the ocean wave the warrior greeks
his loss deploring to apollo then
the cloudcompeller thus his speech addressd

go straight to hector of the brazen helm
good phoebus for beneath the ocean wave
th earthshaker hath withdrawn escaping thus
my high displeasure had he dard resist
the tumult of our strife had reachd the gods
who in the nether realms with saturn dwell
yet thus tis better both for me and him
that though indignant to my will he yields
for to compel him were no easy task
take thou and wave on high thy tasselld shield
the grecian warriors daunting thou thyself
fardarting king thy special care bestow
on noble hector so restore his strength
and vigour that in panic to their ships
and the broad hellespont the greeks be drivn
then will i so by word and deed contrive
that they may gain fresh respite from their toil

he said nor did apollo not obey
his sires commands from idas heights he flew
like to a falcon swooping on a dove
swiftest of birds then priams son he found
the godlike hector stretchd at length no more
but sitting now to consciousness restord
with recognition looking on his friends
the cold sweat dried nor gasping now for breath
since by the will of ægisbearing jove
to life new wakend close beside him stood
the fardestroyer and addressd him thus
hector thou son of priam why apart
from all thy comrades art thou sitting here
feeble and faint what trouble weighs thee down

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
with faltring voice who art thou prince of gods
who thus enquirest of me knowst thou not
how a huge stone by mighty ajax hurld
as on his comrades by the grecian ships
i dealt destruction struck me on the breast
dashd to the earth and all my vigour quelld
i deemd in sooth this day my soul expird
should see the dead and plutos shadowy realm

to whom again the fardestroying king
be of good cheer from saturns son i come
from idas height to be thy guide and guard
phoebus apollo of the golden sword
i who of old have thy protector been
thee and thy city guarding rise then straight
summon thy numrous horsemen bid them drive
their flying cars to assail the grecian ships
i go before and will thy horses way
make plain and smooth and daunt the warrior greeks

his words fresh vigour in the chief infusd
as some proud steed at wellfilld manger fed
his halter broken neighing scours the plain
and revels in the widelyflowing stream
to bathe his sides then tossing high his head
while oer his shoulders streams his ample mane
lightborne on active limbs in conscious pride
to the wide pastures of the mares he flies
so vigrous hector plied his active limbs
his horsemen summoning at heavns command

as when a rustic crowd of men and dogs
have chasd an antlerd stag or mountain goat
that mid the crags and thick oershadowing wood
hath refuge found and baffled their pursuit
if by the tumult rousd a lion stand
with bristling mane before them back they turn
checkd in their mid career evn so the greeks
who late in eager throngs were pressing on
thrusting with swords and doublepointed spears
when hector moving through the ranks they saw
recoild and to their feet their courage fell
to whom thus thoas spoke andraemons son
ætolias bravest warrior skilld to throw
the javlin dauntless in the stubborn fight
by few surpassd in speech when in debate
in full assembly grecian youths contend
he thus with prudent speech began and said

great is the marvel which our eyes behold
that hector see again to life restord
escapd the death we hopd him to have met
beneath the hands of ajax telamon
some god hath been his guard and hector savd
whose arm hath slackd the knees of many a greek
so will he now for not without the aid
of jove the lord of thunder doth he stand
so boldly forth so eager for the fight
hear then and all by my advice be ruld
back to the ships dismiss the genral crowd
while of our army we the foremost men
stand fast and meeting him with levelld spears
hold him in check and he though brave may fear
to throw himself amid our serried ranks

he said they heard and all obeyd his words
the mighty ajax and idomeneus
the king and teucer and meriones
and meges bold as mars with all their best
their stedfast battle rangd to wait th assault
of hector and his trojans while behind
th unwarlike many to the ships retird
the trojan mass came on by hector led
with haughty stride before him phoebus went
his shoulders veild in cloud his arm sustaind
the awful ægis dread to look on hung
with shaggy tassels round and dazzling bright
which vulcan skilful workman gave to jove
to scatter terror mid the souls of men
this on his arm the trojan troops he led
firm stood the mass of greeks from either side
shrill clamours rose and fast from many a string
the arrows flew and many a javlin hurld
by vigrous arms some buried in the flesh
of stalwart youths and many ere they reachd
their living mark fell midway on the plain
fixd in the ground in vain athirst for blood
while phoebus motionless his ægis held
thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell
on either side but when he turnd its flash
full in the faces of the astonishd greeks
and shouted loud their spirits within them quaild
their fiery courage borne in mind no more
as when two beasts of prey at dead of night
with sudden onset scatter wide a herd
of oxen or a numrous flock of sheep
their keepers absent so unnervd by fear
the greeks dispersd such panic mid their ranks
that victry so might crown the trojan arms
apollo sent and as the masses broke
each trojan slew his man by hectors hand
fell stichius and arcesilas the one
the leader of bœotias brassclad host
the other brave menestheus trusted friend
æneas medon slew and iasus
medon the great oileus bastard son
brother of ajax he in phylace
far from his native home was drivn to dwell
since one to eriopis near akin
his sire oileus wife his hand had slain
and iasus th athenian chief was deemd
the son of sphelus son of bucolus
polydamas amid the foremost ranks
mecistes slew polites echius
agenor olonius while from paris hand
an arrow mid the crowd of fugitives
shot from behind beneath the shoulder struck
deiocus and through his chest was drivn
these while the trojans of their arms despoild
through ditch and palisades promiscuous dashd
the flying greeks and gaind hardpressd the wall
while loudly hector to the trojans calld
to assail the ships and leave the bloody spoils
whom i elsewhere and from the ships aloof
shall find my hand shall doom him on the spot
for him no funral pyre his kin shall light
or male or female but before the wall
our citys dogs his mangled flesh shall tear

he said and on his horses shoulder point
let fall the lash and loudly through the ranks
calld on the trojans they with answring shout
and noise unspeakable urgd on with him
their harnessd steeds apollo in the van
trod down with ease th embankment of the ditch
and filld it in and oer it bridgd a way
level and wide far as a javlins flight
hurld by an arm that proves its utmost strength
oer this their columns passd apollo bore
his ægis oer them and cast down the wall
easy as when a child upon the beach
in wanton play with hands and feet oerthrows
the mound of sand which late in play he raisd
so phoebus thou the grecian toil and pains
confounding sentest panic through their souls
thus hemmd beside the ships they made their stand
while each exhorted each and all with hands
outstretchd to evry god addressd their prayr
and chief gerenian nestor prop of greece
with hands uplifted towrd the starry heavn

o father jove if any eer to thee
on cornclad plains of argos burnt the fat
of bulls and sheep and offerd up his prayr
for safe return and thine assenting nod
confirmd thy promise o remember now
his prayr stave off the pitiless day of doom
nor let the greeks to trojan arms succumb

thus nestor prayd loud thunderd from on high
the lord of counsel as he heard the prayr
of neleus aged son with double zeal
the trojans as the mind of jove they knew
pressd on the greeks with warlike ardour fird
as oer the bulwarks of a ship pour down
the mighty billows of the widepathd sea
drivn by the blast that tosses high the waves
so down the wall with shouts the trojans pourd
the cars admitted by the ships they fought
with doublepointed spears and hand to hand
these on their chariots on the lofty decks
of their dark vessels those with pondrous spars
which on the ships were stord for naval war
compact and strong their heads encasd in brass

while yet beyond the ships about the wall
the greeks and trojans fought patroclus still
within the tent of brave eurypylus
remaining with his converse soothd the chief
and healing unguents to his wound applied
of powr to charm away the bitter pains
but when the trojans pouring oer the wall
and routed greeks in panic flight he saw
deeply he groand and smiting on his thigh
with either palm in anguish thus he spoke

eurypylus how great soeer thy need
i can no longer stay so fierce the storm
of battle rages but th attendants care
will all thy wants supply while i in haste
achilles seek and urge him to the war
who knows but heavn may grant me to succeed
for great is oft a friends persuasive powr
he said and quickly on his errand sped

meanwhile the greeks in firm array endurd
the onset of the trojans nor could these
the assailants though in numbers less repel
nor those again the grecian masses break
and force their passage through the ships and tents
as by a rule in cunning workmans hand
who all his art by pallas aid has learnt
a vessels plank is smooth and even laid
so level lay the balance of the fight
others round other ships maintaind the war
but hector that of ajax sought alone
for that one ship they two unwearied toild
nor hector ajax from his post could move
and burn the ship with fire nor he repel
the foe who came protected by a god
then noble ajax with his javlin smote
caletor son of clytius through the breast
as towrd the ship a blazing torch he bore
thundring he fell and droppd his hand the torch
but hector when his eyes his kinsman saw
by the dark vessel prostrate in the dust
on trojans and on lycians calld aloud

trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter in this press of war
slack not your efforts haste to save the son
of clytius nor let greeks his arms possess
who mid their throng of ships has nobly falln
at ajax as he spoke his gleaming spear
he threw but missd his aim yet lycophron
his comrade of cythera mastors son

standing beside the chief above the ear
he struck and piercd the brain from the tall prow
backwards he fell his limbs relaxd in death
then ajax shuddring on his brother calld

good teucer we have lost a faithful friend
the son of mastor our cytheran guest
whom as a father all reverd who now
lies slain by noble hector where are then
thine arrows swiftwingd messengers of fate
and where thy trusty bow apollos gift

thus ajax teucer heard and ran in haste
and stood beside him with his bended bow
and wellstord quiver on the trojans fast
he pourd his shafts and struck pisenors son
clitus the comrade of polydamas
the noble son of panthous he the reins
held in his hand and all his care bestowd
to guide his horses for whereer the throng
was thickest there in hectors cause and troys
he still was found but oer him hung the doom
which none might turn aside for from behind
the fateful arrow struck him through the neck
down from the car he fell swerving aside
the startled horses whirld the empty car
them first the king polydamas beheld
and stayd their course to protiaons son
astynous then he gave them with command
to keep good watch and still be near at hand
then mid the foremost joind again the fray
again at hector of the brazen helm
an arrow teucer aimd and had the shaft
the life of hector quenchd in mid career
not long the fight had ragd around the ships
but joves allseeing eye beheld who watchd
oer hectors life and teucers hopes deceivd
the bows welltwisted string he snappd in twain
as teucer drew the brasstippd arrow flew
wide of the mark and droppd his hand the bow
then to his brother all aghast he cried
o heavn some god our bestlaid schemes of war
confounds who from my hand hath wrenchd the bow
and snappd the newlytwisted string which i
but late attachd my swiftwingd shafts to bear

whom answerd thus great ajax telamon
o friend leave there thine arrows and thy bow
marrd by some god who grudges our renown
but take in hand thy pondrous spear and cast
thy shield about thy shoulders and thyself
stand forth and urge the rest to face the foe
let us not tamely yield if yield we must
our wellbuilt ships but nobly dare the fight

thus ajax spoke and teucer in the tent
bestowed his bow and oer his shoulders threw
his fourfold shield and on his firmset head
a helm he placd wellwrought with horsehair plume
that nodded fearful oer his brow his hand
graspd the firm spear with sharpend point of brass
then ran and swiftly stood by ajax side
hector meanwhile who saw the weapon marrd
to trojans and to lycians calld aloud

trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter quit ye now like men
against the ships your wonted valour show
een now before our eyes hath jove destroyd
a chieftains weapon easy tis to trace
oer human wars th oerruling hand of jove
to whom he gives the prize of victory
and whom withholding aid he minishes
as now the greeks while we his favour gain
pour then your force united on the ships
and if there be among you who this day
shall meet his doom by sword or arrow slain
een let him die a glorious death is his
who for his country falls and dying leaves
preservd from danger children wife and home
his heritage uninjurd when the greeks
embarking hence shall take their homeward way

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
ajax on th other side addressd the greeks

shame on ye greeks this very hour decides
if we must perish or be savd and ward
destruction from our ships and can ye hope
that each if hector of the glancing helm
shall burn our ships on foot can reach his home
or hear ye not how burning to destroy
our vessels hector cheers his forces on
not to the dance but to the fight he calls
nor better counsel can for us be found
than in close fight with heart and hand to join
twere better far at once to die than live
hemmd in and straitend thus in dire distress
close to our ships by meaner men beset

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
then hector schedius perimedes son
the thracian leader slew on th other side
ajax the captain of the foot oercame
laodamas antenors noble son
while of his arms polydamas despoild
cyllenian otus friend of phyleus son
the proud epeians leader meges saw
and rushd upon him but polydamas
stooping the blow evaded him he missd
for phoebus willd not panthous son should fall
in the front rank contending but the spear
smote croesmus through the breast thundring he fell
and from his corpse the victor strippd his arms
him dolops son of lampus spearman skilld
well traind in evry point of war assaild
 from close at hand
forward he sprang and thrust at meges shield
but him the solid corslet which he wore
with breast and backpiece fitted savd from harm
the corslet phyleus brought from ephyra
by selles stream euphetes king of men
bestowd it as a friendly gift to wear
in battle for a guard from hostile spears
which from destruction now preservd his son
next meges struck with keenedgd spear the crown
of dolops brassbound horsehaircrested helm
sevring the horsehair plume which brilliant late
with crimson dye now lay defild in dust
yet fought he on and still for victry hopd
but warlike menelaus to the aid
of meges came of dolops unobservd
he stood and from behind his shoulder piercd
the point its course pursuing through his breast
was drivn and headlong on his face he fell
forthwith advancd the two to seize the spoils
but loudly hector on his kinsmen calld
on all but chief on icetaons son
the valiant melanippus he erewhile
in far percote ere the foes appeard
pasturd his herds but when the ships of greece
approachd the shore to ilium back he came
there mid the trojans eminent he dwelt
in priams house belovd as priams son
him hector calld by name and thus addressd

why melanippus stand we idly thus
doth not thy slaughterd kinsmen touch thy heart
see how they rush on dolops arms to seize
then on no distant war must now be wagd
but hand to hand till or the greeks be slain
or lofty troy with all her children fall

he said and led the way him followd straight
the godlike chief great ajax telamon
meanwhile the greeks encouragd to the fight
and cried brave comrades quit ye now like men
bear a stout heart and in the stubborn fight
let each to other mutual succour give
by mutual succour more are savd than fall
in timid flight nor fame nor safety lies

he said and pondring well his words they stood
firm in defence as with a wall of brass
the ships they guarded though against them jove
led on the trojans menelaus then
with stirring words antilochus addressd
antilochus than thou of all the greeks
is none more active or more light of foot
none stronger hurls the spear then from the crowd
spring forth and aim to reach some trojans life

thus saying he withdrew fird by his words
forth sprang the youth and poisd his glittring spear
glancing around him back the trojans drew
before his aim nor flew the spear in vain
but through the breast it piercd as on he came
brave melanippus icetaons son
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang
forth sprang antilochus as springs a hound
upon a fawn which from its lair disturbd
a hunters shaft has struck and quelld its powrs
so melanippus sprang to seize thy spoils
the stout antilochus but not unmarkd
of hectors eye who hastning through the press
advancd to meet him waited not th attack
bold warrior as he was antilochus
but trembling fled as when a beast of prey
conscious of evil deed amid the herd
the guardian dog or herdsmans self has slain
and flies ere yet th avenging crowd collect
so fled the son of nestor onward pressd
by hector led the trojans loud their shouts
as on the greeks their murdrous shafts they pourd
yet turnd he when his comrades ranks he reachd
then on the ships as ravning lions fell
the trojans they but workd the will of jove
who still their courage raisd and quelld the greeks
of victry these debarrd and those inspird
for so he willd that hector priams son
should wrap in fire the beaked ships of greece
and thetis to the uttermost obtain
her overbold petition yet did jove
the lord of counsel wait but to behold
the flames ascending from the blazing ships
for from that hour the trojans backward drivn
should to the greeks the final triumph leave
with such design to seize the ships he fird
th already burning zeal of priams son
fiercely he ragd as terrible as mars
with brandishd spear or as a raging fire
mid the dense thickets on the mountain side
the foam was on his lips bright flashd his eyes
beneath his awful brows and terribly
above his temples wavd amid the fray
the helm of hector jove himself from heavn
his guardian hand extending him alone
with glory crowning mid the host of men
but short his term of glory for the day
was fast approaching when with pallas aid
the might of peleus son should work his doom
oft he essayd to break the ranks whereer
the densest and throng noblest arms he saw
but strenuous though his efforts all were vain
they massd in close array his charge withstood
firm as a craggy rock upstanding high
close by the hoary sea which meets unmovd
the boistrous currents of the whistling winds
and the big waves that bellow round its base
so stood unmovd the greeks and undismayd
at length all blazing in his arms he sprang
upon the mass so plunging down as when
on some tall vessel from beneath the clouds
a giant billow tempestnursd descends
the deck is drenchd in foam the stormy wind
howls in the shrouds th affrighted seamen quail
in fear but little way from death removd
so quaild the spirit in evry grecian breast

as when a ravning lion on a herd
of heifers falls which on some marshy mead
feed numberless beneath the care of one
unskilld from beasts of prey to guard his charge
and while beside the front or rear he walks
the lion on th unguarded centre springs
seizes on one and scatters all the rest
so hector led by jove in wild alarm
scatterd the grecians all but one alone
brave periphetes of mycenæ slew
the son of copreus whom eurystheus sent
his envoy to the might of hercules
far nobler than the father was the son
in speed of foot in warlike might in mind
in all among mycenians foremost he
who now on hector fresh renown conferrd
for backward as he steppd against the rim
of the broad shield which for defence he bore
down reaching to his feet he trippd and thus
entangled backward fell and as he fell
around his temples clatterd loud his helm
hector beheld and oer him stood in haste
and with his spear transfixd his breast and slew
before his comrades eyes yet dard not one
though grieving for their comrades loss advance
to rescue such of hector was their awe
they fronted now the ships the leading prows
which first were drawn on shore still barrd their way
yet on they streamd and from the foremost ships
now hardly pressd the greeks perforce retird
but closely massd before the tents they stood
not scatterd oer the camp by shame restraind
and fear and loudly each exhorted each
gerenian nestor chief the prop of greece
thus by their fathers singly each adjurd
quit ye like men dear friends and think it shame
to forfeit now the praise of other men
let each man now his children and his wife
his fortunes and his parents bear in mind
and not the living only but the dead
for them the absent i your suppliant pray
that firm ye stand and scorn disgraceful flight

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
and from their eyeballs pallas purgd away
the film of darkness and on evry side
both towrd the ships and towrd the level fight
clear light diffusd there hector they discernd
and all his comrades those who stood aloof
and those who near the ships maintaind the war
then was not ajax mighty soul content
to stand where stood the other sons of greece
along the vessels lofty decks he movd
with haughty stride a pondrous boardingpike
well polishd and with rivets well securd
of two and twenty cubits length he bore
as one wellskilld in feats of horsemanship
who from a troop of horses on the plain
has parted four and down the crowded road
while men and women all in wonder gaze
drives towrd the city and with force untird
from one to other springs as on they fly
oer many a vessels deck so ajax passd
with lofty stride and voice that reachd to heavn
as loudly shouting on the greeks he calld
to save their ships and tents nor hector stayd
amid the closely bucklerd trojan ranks
but as upon a flock of birds that feed
beside a rivers bank or geese or cranes
or longneckd swans a fiery eagle swoops
so on the darkprowd ship with furious rush
swept hector down him jove with mighty hand
sustaind and with him forward urgd the crowd
fierce round the ships again the battle ragd
well might ye deem no previous toil had worn
their strength who in that dread encounter met
with edge so keen and stubborn will they fought
but varying far their hopes and fears the greeks
of safety and escape from death despaird
while high the hopes in evry trojans breast
to burn the ships and slay the warlike greeks
so minded each opposd in arms they stood

on a swiftsailing vessels stern that bore
protesilaus to the coast of troy
but to his native country bore not thence
hector had laid his hand around that ship
trojans and greeks in mutual slaughter joind
the arrows or the javlins distant flight
they waited not but fird with equal rage
fought hand to hand with axe and hatchet keen
and mighty swords and doublepointed spears
many a fairhilted blade with iron bound
droppd from the hands or from the severd arms
of warrior chiefs the dark earth ran with blood
yet loosd not hector of the stern his hold
but graspd the poop and on the trojans calld

bring fire and all together loud and clear
your warcry raise this day will jove repay
our labours all with capture of those ships
which hither came against the will of heavn
and which on us unnumberd ills have brought
by our own elders fault who me desiring
evn at their vessels sterns to urge the war
withheld and to the town the troops confind
but jove allseeing if he then oerruld
our better mind himself is now our aid

thus he they onward pressd with added zeal
nor ajax yet endurd by hostile spears
now sorely galld yet but a little space
back to the helmsmans sevnfoot board he movd
expecting death and left the lofty deck
where long he stood on guard but still his spear
the trojans kept aloof whoeer essayd
amid the ships to launch th unwearied flames
and loudly shouting to the greeks he calld

friends grecian heroes ministers of mars
quit ye like men dear friends remember now
your wonted valour think ye in your rear
to find supporting forces or some fort
whose walls may give you refuge from your foe
no city is nigh whose wellappointed towrs
mannd by a friendly race may give us aid
but here upon the wellarmd trojans soil
and only resting on the sea we lie
far from our country not in faint retreat
but in our own good arms our safety lies

he said and with his sharpedgd spear his words
he followd up if any trojan dard
by hectors call inspird with fiery brand
to assail the ships him with his ponderous spear
would ajax meet and thus before the ships
twelve warriors hand to hand his prowess felt




thus round the wellmannd ship they wagd the war
meanwhile by peleus son patroclus stood
weeping hot tears as some darkwaterd fount
pours oer a craggy rock its gloomy stream
achilles swift of foot with pity saw
and to his friend these winged words addressd

why weeps patroclus like an infant girl
that prays her mother by whose side she runs
to take her up and clinging to her gown
impedes her way and still with tearful eyes
looks in her face until she take her up
evn as that girl patroclus such art thou
shedding soft tears hast thou some tidings brought
touching the genral weal or me alone
or have some evil news from phthia come
known but to thee menoetius actors son
yet surely lives and mid his myrmidons
lives aged peleus son of æacus
their deaths indeed might well demand our tears
or weepst thou for the greeks who round their ships
by death their former insolence repay
speak out that i may know thy cause of grief

to whom with bitter groans patroclus thus
o son of peleus noblest of the greeks
achilles be not wroth such weight of woe
the grecian camp oppresses in their ships
they who were late their bravest and their best
sore wounded all by spear or arrow lie
the valiant son of tydeus diomed
piercd by a shaft ulysses by a spear
and agamemnons self eurypylus
by a sharp arrow through the thigh transfixd
for these the large resources of their art
the leeches ply and on their wounds attend
while thou achilles still remainst unmovd
oh be it never mine to nurse such hate
as thou retainst inflexibly severe
who eer may hope in future days by thee
to profit if thou now forbear to save
the greeks from shame and loss unfeeling man
sure peleus horseman brave was neer thy sire
nor thetis bore thee from the cold grey sea
and craggy rocks thou hadst thy birth so hard
and stubborn is thy soul but if the fear
of evil prophesied thyself restrain
or message by thy goddessmother brought
from jove yet send me forth with all thy force
of myrmidons to be the saving light
of greece and let me to the battle bear
thy glittring arms if so the men of troy
scard by thy likeness may forsake the field
and breathingtime afford the sons of greece
toilworn for little pause has yet been theirs
fresh and unwearied we may drive with ease
to their own city from our ships and tents
the trojans worn and battlewearied men

thus prayd he all unwisely for the prayr
he utterd to himself was fraught with death
to whom much grievd achilles swift of foot
heavnborn patroclus oh what words are these
of prophecy i reck not though i know
nor message hath my mother brought from jove
but it afflicts my soul when one i see
that basely robs his equal of his prize
his lawful prize by highest valour won
such grief is mine such wrong have i sustaind
her whom the sons of greece on me bestowd
prize of my spear the wellwalld city stormd
the mighty agamemnon atreus son
hath borne by force away as from the hands
of some dishonourd houseless vagabond
but let the past be past i never meant
my wrath should have no end yet had not thought
my anger to abate till my own ships
should hear the warcry and the battle bear
but go and in my wellknown armour clad
lead forth the valiant myrmidons to war
since the dark cloud of trojans circles round
the ships in force and on the shingly beach
pent up in narrow limits lie the greeks
and all the city hath pourd its numbers forth
in hope undoubting for they see no more
my helm among them flashing else in flight
their dead would choke the streams if but to me
great agamemnon bore a kindly mind
but round the camp the battle now is wagd
no more the hands of valiant diomed
the greeks protecting hurl his fiery spear
nor hear i now from his detested lips
the shout of agamemnon all around
is heard the warriorslayer hectors voice
cheering his trojans with triumphant cries
they from the vanquishd greeks hold all the plain
nathless do thou patroclus in defence
fall boldly on lest they with blazing fire
our ships destroy and hinder our retreat
but hear and ponder well the end of all
i have to say and so for me obtain
honour and glory in the eyes of greece
and that the beauteous maiden to my arms
they may restore with costly gifts to boot
the ships relievd return forthwith and though
the thundrer junos lord should crown thine arms
with triumph be not rash apart from me
in combat with the warlike sons of troy
 
nor in the keen excitement of the fight
and slaughter of the trojans lead thy troops
on towrd the city lest thou find thyself
by some one of th immortal gods opposd
for the fardarting phoebus loves them well
but when in safety thou hast placd the ships
delay not to return and leave the rest
to battle on the plain for would to jove
to pallas and apollo that not one
or greek or trojan might escape from death
save only thou and i that so we two
alone might raze the sacred towrs of troy

such converse held they while by hostile spears
hard pressd no longer ajax might endure
at once by joves high will and trojan foes
oermasterd loud beneath repeated blows
clatterd around his brow the glittring helm
as on the wellwrought crest the weapons fell
and his left arm grew faint that long had borne
the burthen of his shield yet nought availd
the press of spears to drive him from his post
labring he drew his breath his evry limb
with sweat was reeking breathing space was none
blow followd blow and ills were heapd on ill

say now ye nine who on olympus dwell
how first the fire assaild the grecian ships

hector approachd and on the ashen spear
of ajax close behind the head let fall
his mighty sword right through he clove the wood
and in his hand the son of telamon
the headless shaft held bootless far away
loud ringing fell to earth the brazen point
ajax dismayed perceived the hand of heaven
and knew that jove the thunderer had decreed
to thwart his hopes and victory give to troy
slow he retird and to the vessel they
the blazing torch applied high rose the flame
unquenchable and wrappd the poop in fire
the son of peleus saw and with his palm
smote on his thigh and to patroclus calld
up nobly born patroclus carborne chief
up for i see above the ships ascend
the hostile fires and lest they seize the ships
and hinder our retreat do thou in haste
thine armour don while i arouse the troops

he said his dazzling arms patroclus donnd
first on his legs the wellwrought greaves he fixd
fastend with silver clasps his ample chest
the breastplate of achilles swift of foot
starspangled richly wrought defended well
around his shoulders slung his sword he bore
brassbladed silverstudded next his shield
weighty and strong and on his firmset head
a helm he wore wellwrought with horsehair plume
that nodded fearful oer his brow his hand
graspd two stout spears familiar to his hold
one spear achilles had long pondrous tough
but this he touchd not none of all the greeks
none save achilles self that spear could poise
the farfamd pelian ash which to his sire
on pelions summit felld to be the bane
of mightiest chiefs the centaur chiron gave
then to automedon he gave command
to yoke the horses him he honourd most
next to achilles self the trustiest he
in battle to await his chiefs behest
the flying steeds he harnessd to the car
xanthus and balius fleeter than the winds
whom grazing in the marsh by oceans stream
podarge swift of foot to zephyr bore
and by their side the matchless pedasus
whom from the capture of eetions town
achilles bore away a mortal horse
but with immortal coursers meet to vie

meantime achilles through their several tents
summond to arms the warlike myrmidons
they all like ravning wolves of courage high
that on the mountain side have hunted down
an antlerd stag and battend on his flesh
their chaps all dyed with blood in troops they go
with their lean tongues from some blackwaterd fount
to lap the surface of the dark cool wave
their jaws with blood yet reeking unsubdued
their courage and their bellies gorgd with flesh
so round pelides valiant follower throngd
the chiefs and rulers of the myrmidons
achilles in the midst to charioteers
and bucklerd warriors issued his commands
fifty swift ships achilles dear to jove
led to the coast of troy and rangd in each
fifty brave comrades mannd the rowers seats
oer these five chiefs on whom he most relied
he placd himself the sovreign lord of all
one band menestheus led with glancing mail
son of sperchius heavndescended stream
him peleus daughter polydora fair
a mortal in a gods embrace compressd
to stout sperchius bore but by repute
to boras perieres son who her
in public and with ample dowr espousd
the brave eudorus led the second band
whom phylas daughter polymele fair
to hermes bore the maid he saw and lovd
amid the virgins mingling in the dance
of goldenshafted dian huntressqueen
he to her chamber access found and gaind
by stealth her bed a valiant son she bore
eudorus swift of foot in battle strong
but when her infant by lucinas aid
was brought to light and saw the face of day
her to his home with ample dowr enrichd
echecles son of actor bore away
while him the aged phylas kept and nursd
with tender care and cherishdas his own
the brave peisander son of maemalus
the third commanded of the myrmidons
next to pelides friend the noblest spear
the fourth the aged warrior phoenix led
the fifth alcimedon laerces son
these in their order due achilles first
arrayd and next with stirring words addressd

ye myrmidons forget not now the vaunts
which while my wrath endurd ye largely pourd
upon the trojans me ye freely blamd
illomend son of peleus sure in wrath
thou wast conceivd implacable who here
in idleness enforcd thy comrades keepst
twere better far our homeward way to take
if such pernicious rancour fill thy soul
thus ye reproachd me oft lo now ye have
the great occasion which your souls desird
then on and with brave hearts the trojans meet

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
and more compact beneath their monarchs eye
their ranks were formd as when the builder lays
the closelyfitting stones to form the wall
of some great house and brave the winds of heavn
so close were fitted helm and bossy shield
buckler on buckler pressd and helm on helm
and man on man the horsehair plumes above
that nodded fearful from the warriors brows
each other touchd so closely massd they stood
before them all stood prominent in arms
two chiefs patroclus and automedon
both with one thought possessd to lead the fight
in the forefront of all the myrmidons
achilles then within his tent withdrew
and of a gorgeous coffer raisd the lid
wellwrought by silverfooted thetis placd
on board his ship and filld with rich attire
with store of windproof cloaks and carpets soft
there lay a goblet richly chasd whence none
but he alone might drink the ruddy wine
nor might libations thence to other gods
be made save only jove this brought he forth
and first with sulphur purified and next
washd with pure water then his hands he washd
and drew the ruddy wine then standing forth
made in the centre of the court his prayr
and as he pourd the wine lookd up to heavn
not unbeheld of jove the lightnings lord

great king dodonas lord pelasgian jove
who dwellst on high and rulst with sovreign sway
dodonas wintry heights where dwell around
thy sellian priests men of unwashen feet
that on the bare ground sleep thou once before
hast heard my prayr and me with honour crownd
and on the greeks inflicted all thy plagues
hear yet again and this my boon accord
i mid the throng of ships myself remain
but with a numrous force of myrmidons
i send my comrade in my stead to fight
on him allseeing jove thy favour pour
strengthen his heart that hectors self may learn
if een alone my follower knows to fight
or only then resistless powr displays
when i myself the toil of battle share
and from our vessels when the foe is drivn
grant that with all his arms and comrades true
he may in safety to the ships return

thus prayd he jove the lord of counsel heard
and half his prayr he granted half denied
for from the ships the battle to repel
he granted but denied his safe return
his prayrs and offrings ended to the tent
achilles turnd again and in the chest
replacd the cup then issuing forth he stood
before the tent for much he longd to see
the greeks and trojans join in battle strife
they who in arms round brave patroclus stood
their line of battle formd with courage high
to dash upon the trojans and as wasps
that have their nest beside the public road
which boys delight to vex and irritate
in wanton play but to the genral harm
them if some passing travller unawares
disturb with angry courage forth they rush
in one continuous swarm to guard their nest
een with such courage pourd the myrmidons
forth from the ships then uproar wild arose
and loud patroclus on his comrades calld

ye valiant myrmidons who boast yourselves
achilles comrades quit ye now like men
your ancient valour prove to peleus son
of all the greeks the noblest so shall we
his faithful followers highest honour give
and agamemnons haughty self shall mourn
the slight on grecias bravest warrior cast

his words fresh courage rousd in evry breast
thick on the trojan host their masses fell
while loud the fleet reechoed to the sound
of grecian cheers but when the trojans saw
blazing in arms menoetius godlike son
himself and follower quaild the spirits of all
their firmset ranks were shaken for they deemd
achilles had beside the ships exchangd
his wrath for friendship and each sevral man
lookd round to find his own escape from death

then first patroclus aimd his glittring spear
amid the crowd where thickest round the ships
of brave protesilaus raged the war
and struck pyraechmes who from amydon
from the wideflowing stream of axius led
the horsehaircrested paeons him he struck
through the right shoulder backwards in the dust
groaning he fell around him quaild with fear
his paeons all such terror in their ranks
patroclus threw their bravest leader slain
the foremost in the fight the crowd he drove
far from the ships and quenchd the blazing fire
there lay the halfburnt ship with shouts confusd
the trojans fled and from amid the ships
forth pourd the greeks and loud the clamour rose

as when around a lofty mountains top
the lightnings lord dispels a mass of cloud
and evry crag and evry jutting peak
is plainly seen and evry forest glade
and the deep vault of heavn is opend wide
so when the greeks had cleard the ships of fire
they breathd awhile yet ceasd not so the strife
for not in headlong panic from the ships
the trojans by the valiant greeks were drivn
but though perforce retiring still made head

then of the chiefs as wider spread the fight
each singled each menoetius noble son
first threw his pointed spear and on the thigh
struck areilochus in act to turn
right through the point was drivn the weighty spear
shatterd the bone and prone to earth he fell
the warlike menelaus aimd his spear
where thoas breast unguarded by his shield
was left exposd and slackd his limbs in death
phyleus brave son as rushd amphiclus on
stood firm with eye observant then th attack
preventing through his thigh high up where lie
the strongest muscles smote the weapons point
severd the tendons darkness closd his eyes
of nestors sons antilochus the first
atymnius wounded driving through his flank
he brazen spear prone on his face he fell
then burning to avenge his brothers death
stood maris oer the corpse and hand to hand
engaged antilochus but ere a blow
was struck the godlike thrasymedes drove
through his right shoulder with unerring aim
his glittring spear the point his upper arm
tore from the muscles shattring all the bone
thundring he fell and darkness closd his eyes
so to the shades by those two brethrens hands
subdued sarpedons comrades brave were sent
the sons of amisodarus who reard
the dread chimaera bane of mortal men
on cleobulus wounded in the press
ajax oileus sprang and captive took
alive but sudden on his neck let fall
his hilted sword and quenchd the fire of life
the hot blood dyed the sword the darkling shades
of death and rigrous fate his eyes oerspread
then peneleus and lycon hand to hand
engagd in combat both had missd their aim
and bootless hurld their weapons then with swords
they met first lycon on the crested helm
dealt a fierce blow but in his hand the blade
up to the hilt was shiverd then the sword
of peneleus his neck below the ear
disseverd deeply in his throat the blade
was plungd and by the skin alone was stayd
down droopd his head his limbs relaxd in death
meriones by speed of foot oertook
and as his car he mounted acarnas
though the right shoulder piercd down from the car
he fell the shades of death his eyes oerspread
full on the mouth of erymas was thrust
the weapon of idomeneus right through
the white bones crashing passd the brazen spear
below the brain his teeth were shatterd all
with blood which with convulsive sobs he blew
from mouth and nostril both his eyes were filld
and deaths dark cloud encompassd him around
thus slew the grecian leaders each his man

as ravning wolves that lambs or kids assail
strayd from their dams by careless shepherds left
upon the mountain scatterd these they see
and tear at once their unresisting prey
so on the trojans fell the greeks in rout
disastrous they unmannd by terror fled
great ajax still unwearied longd to hurl
his spear at hector of the brazen helm
but he well skilld in war his shoulders broad
protected by his shield of tough bulls hide
watchd for the whizzing shafts and javlins whirr
full well he knew the tide of battle turnd
yet held his ground his trusty friends to save

as from olympus oer the clear blue sky
pour the dark clouds when jove the vault of heavn
oerspreads with storm and tempest from the ships
so pourd with panic cries the flying host
and in disorderd rout recrossd the trench
then hectors flying coursers bore him safe
far from the struggling masses whom the ditch
detaind perforce there many a royal car
with broken pole th unharnessd horses left
on shouting to the greeks patroclus pressd
the flying trojans they with panic cries
dispersd the roads encumberd high uprose
the storms of dust as from the tents and ships
back to the city stretchd the flying steeds
and ever where the densest throng appeard
with furious threats patroclus urgd his course
his glowing axle tracd by prostrate men
hurld from their cars and chariots overthrown
flew oer the deepsunk trench th immortal steeds
the noble prize the gods to peleus gave
still onward straining for he longd to reach
and hurl his spear at hector him meanwhile
his flying steeds in safety bore away

as in th autumnal season when the earth
with weight of rain is saturate when jove
pours down his fiercest storms in wrath to men
who in their courts unrighteous judgments pass
and justice yield to lawless violence
the wrath of heavn despising evry stream
is brimming oer the hills in gullies deep
are by the torrents seamd which rushing down
from the high mountains to the darkblue sea
with groans and tumult urge their headlong course
wasting the works of man so urgd their flight
so as they fled the trojan horses groand
the foremost ranks cut off back towrd the ships
patroclus drove them baffling their attempts
to gain the city and in middle space
between the ships the stream and lofty wall
dealt slaughter round him and of many a chief
the bitter penalty of death requird
then pronous with his glittring spear he struck
where by the shield his breast was left exposd
and slackd his limbs in death thundring he fell
next thestor son of œnops he assaild
he on his polishd car downcrouching sat
his mind by fear disorderd from his hands
the reins had droppd him thrusting with the spear
through the right cheek and through the teeth he smote
then draggd him by the weapon oer the rail
as when an angler on a prominent rock
drags from the sea to shore with hook and line
a weighty fish so him patroclus draggd
gaping from off the car and dashd him down
upon his face and life forsook his limbs
next eryalus eager for the fray
on the mid forehead with a mighty stone
he struck beneath the pondrous helmets weight
the skull was split in twain prostrate he fell
by lifeconsuming death encompassd round
forthwith amphoterus and erymas
epaltes echius and tlepolemus
son of damastor pyris ipheus brave
euippus polymelus argeas son
in quick succession to the ground he brought
sarpedon his ungirdled forces saw
promiscuous fall before menoetius son
and to the lycians calld in loud reproof
shame lycians whither fly ye why this haste
i will myself this chief confront and learn
who this may be of bearing proud and high
who on the trojans grievous harm hath wrought
and many a warriors limbs relaxd in death

he said and from his car accoutred sprang
patroclus saw and he too leapd to earth
as on a lofty rock with angry screams
hookbeakd with talons curvd two vultures fight
so with loud shouts these two to battle rushd
the son of saturn pitying saw and thus
to juno spoke his sister and his wife

woe woe that fate decrees my bestbelovd
sarpedon by patroclus hand to fall
een now conflicting thoughts my soul divide
to bear him from the fatal strife unhurt
and set him down on lycias fertile plains
or leave him by patroclus hand to fall

whom answerd thus the stageyd queen of heavn
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
wouldst thou a mortal man from death withdraw
long since by fate decreed do what thou wilt
yet cannot we the rest applaud thine act
this too i say and turn it in thy mind
if to his home sarpedon thou restore
alive bethink thee will not other gods
their sons too from the stubborn fight withdraw
for in the field around the walls of troy
are many sons of gods in all of whom
this act of thine will angry feelings rouse
but if thou love him and thy soul deplore
his coming doom yet in the stubborn fight
leave him beneath patroclus hand to fall
then when his spirit hath fled the charge assign
to death and gentle sleep that in their arms
they bear him safe to lycias widespread plains
there shall his brethren and his friends perform
his funral rites and mound and column raise
the fitting tribute to the mighty dead

thus she the sire of gods and men complied
but to the ground some drops of blood let fall
in honour of his son whom fate decreed
far from his country on the fertile plains
of troy to perish by patroclus hand
as near the champions drew patroclus first
his weapon hurld and thrasymedes brave
the faithful follower of sarpedon struck
below the waist and slackd his limbs in death
thrown in his turn sarpedons glittring spear
flew wide and pedasus the gallant horse
through the right shoulder wounded with a scream
he fell and in the dust breathd forth his life
as shrieking loud his noble spirit fled
this way and that his two companions swervd
creakd the strong yoke and tangled were the reins
as in the dust the prostrate courser lay
automedon the means of safety saw
and drawing from beside his brawny thigh
his keenedgd sword with no uncertain blow
cut loose the fallen horse again set straight
the two extended stretchd the tightened rein
again in mortal strife the warriors closd
once more sarpedon hurld his glittring spear
in vain above patroclus shoulder flew
the point innocuous from his hand in turn
the spear not vainly thrown sarpedon struck
where lies the diaphragm below the heart
he fell as falls an oak or poplar tall
or lofty pine which on the mountain top
for some proud ship the woodmans axe hath hewn
so he with deathcry sharp before his car
extended lay and clutchd the bloodstaind soil
as when a lion on the herd has sprung
and mid the heifers seizd the lordly bull
lies bellowing crushd between the lions jaws
so by patroclus slain the lycian chief
undaunted still his faithful comrade calld
good glaucus warrior tried behoves thee now
thy spearmanship to prove and warlike might
welcome the fray put forth thine utmost speed
call on the lycian chiefs on evry side
to press around and for sarpedon fight
thou too thine arms for my protection wield
for i to thee through all thy future days
shall be a ceaseless scandal and reproach
if me thus slain before the grecian ships
the greeks be sufferd of my arms to spoil
but stand thou fast and others courage raise

thus as he spoke the shades of death oerspread
his eyes and nostrils then with foot firmset
upon his chest patroclus from the corpse
drew by main force the fastadhering spear
the life forth issuing with the weapons point
loosd from the royal car the snorting steeds
eager for flight the myrmidons detaind
deepgrieving glaucus heard his voice and chafed
his spirit within him that he lacked the power
to aid his comrade with his hand he graspd
his wounded arm in torture from the shaft
by teucer shot to save the greeks from death
as on he pressed to scale the lofty wall
then to apollo thus addressd his prayr

hear me great king who as on lycias plains
art here in troy and hearst in evry place
their voice who suffer as i suffer now
a grievous wound i bear and sharpest pangs
my arm assail nor may the blood he stanchd
the pain weighs down my shoulder and my hand
hath lost its powr to fight or grasp my spear
sarpedon bravest of the brave is slain
the son of jove yet jove preservd him not
but thou o king this grievous wound relieve
assuage the pain and give me strength to urge
my lycian comrades to maintain the war
and fight myself to guard the noble dead

thus as he prayd his prayr apollo heard
assuagd his pains and from the grievous wound
stanch d the dark blood and filld his soul with strength
glaucus within himself perceivd and knew
rejoicing that the god had heard his prayr
the lycian leaders first on evry side
he urgd to hasten for their king to fight
then mid the trojans went with lofty step
and first to panthous son polydamas
to brave agenor and æneas next
then hector of the brazen helm himself
approaching thus with winged words addressd

hector forgettst thou quite thy brave allies
who freely in thy cause pour forth their lives
far from their home and friends but they from thee
no aid receive sarpedon lies in death
the leader of the bucklerd lycian bands
whose justice and whose powr were lycias shield
him by patroclus hand hath mars subdued
but friends stand by me now with just revenge
inspird determine that the myrmidons
shall not how grievd soeer for all the greeks
who by our spears beside the ships have falln
our dead dishonour and his arms obtain

he said and through the trojans thrilld the sense
of grief intolerable unrestraind
for he though strangerborn was of the state
a mighty pillar and his followers
a numrous host and he himself in fight
among the foremost so against the greeks
with fiery zeal they rushd by hector led
grievd for sarpedons loss on th other side
patroclus manly heart the greeks arousd
and to th ajaces first themselves inflamed
with warlike zeal he thus addressd his speech

ye sons of ajax now is come the time
your former fame to rival or surpass
the man hath falln who first oerleapd our wall
sarpedon now remains that having slain
we should his corpse dishonour and his arms
strip off and should some comrade dare attempt
his rescue him too with our spears subdue

he said and they with martial ardour fird
rushd to the conflict when on either side
the reinforcd battalions were arrayd
trojans and lycians myrmidons and greeks
around the dead in sternest combat met
with fearful shouts and loud their armour rang
then to enhance the horror of the strife
around his son with darkness jove oerspread
the stubborn fight the trojans first drove back
the keeneyd greeks for first a warrior fell
not of the meanest mid the myrmidons
epegeus son of valiant agacles
who in budaeums thriving state bore rule
erewhile but flying for a kinsman slain
to peleus and the silverfooted queen
he came a suppliant with achilles thence
to ilium sent to join the war of troy
him as he stretchd his hand to seize the dead
full on the forehead with a massive stone
great hector smote within the pondrous helm
the skull was split in twain prone on the corpse
he fell by lifedestroying death subdued
grievd was patroclus for his comrade slain
forward he darted as a swiftwingd hawk
that swoops amid the starlings and the daws
so swift didst thou patroclus carborne chief
upon the trojans and the lycians spring
thy soul with anger for thy comrade filld
a pondrous stone he hurld at sthenelas
son of ithaemenes the mighty mass
fell on his neck and all the muscles crushd
back drew great hector and the chiefs of troy
far as a javlins flight in sportive strife
or in the deadly battle hurld by one
his utmost strength exerting back so far
the trojans drew so far the greeks pursued
glaucus the leader of the lycian spears
first turning slew the mighty bathycles
the son of chalcon he in hellas dwelt
in wealth surpassing all the myrmidons
him as he gaind upon him in pursuit
quick turning glaucus through the breast transfixd
thundring he fell deep grief possessd the greeks
at loss of one so valiant fiercely joyd
the trojans and around him crowded thick
nor of their wonted valour were the greeks
oblivious but still onward held their course
then slew meriones a crested chief
the bold laogonus onetors son
onetor of idaean jove the priest
and by the people as a god reverd
below the ear he struck him from his limbs
the spirit fled and darkness veild his eyes

then at meriones æneas threw
his brazen spear in hopes beneath his shield
to find a spot unguarded he beheld
and downward stooping shunnd the brazen death
behind him far deep in the soil infixd
the weapon stood there mars its impulse stayd
so bootless hurld though by no feeble hand
æneas spear stood quivring in the ground
then thus in wrath he cried meriones
had it but struck thee nimble as thou art
my spear had brought thy dancing to a close

to whom the spearman skilld meriones
brave as thou art æneas tis too much
for thee to hope the might of all to quell
who dare confront thee thou art mortal too
and if my aim be true and should my spear
but strike thee fair all valiant as thou art
and confident yet me thy fall shall crown
with triumph and thy soul to hades send

he said and him menoetius noble son
addressd with grave rebuke meriones
brave warrior why thus waste the time in words
trust me good friend tis not by vaunting speech
unseconded by deeds that we may hope
to scare away the trojans from the slain
hands are for battle words for council meet
boots it not now to wrangle but to fight

he said and led the way him followd straight
the godlike chief forthwith as loudly rings
amid the mountain forests deep recess
the woodmans axe and far is heard the sound
so from the widespread earth their clamour rose
as brazen arms and shields and tough bullshide
encounterd swords and doublepointed spears
nor might the sharpest sight sarpedon know
from head to foot with wounds and blood and dust
disfigurd thickly round the dead they swarmd
as when at springtide in the cattlesheds
around the milkcans swarm the buzzing flies
while the warm milk is frothing in the pail
so swarmd they round the dead nor jove the while
turnd from the stubborn fight his piercing glance
but still lookd down with gaze intent and musd
upon patroclus coming fate in doubt
if he too there beside sarpedon slain
should perish by illustrious hectors hand
spoild of his arms or yet be spared awhile
to swell the labours of the battlefield
he judgd it best at length that once again
the gallant follower of peleus son
should towrd the town with fearful slaughter drive
the trojans and their brazenhelmed chief
first hectors soul with panic fear he filld
mounting his car he fled and urgd to flight
the trojans for he saw the scales of jove
then nor the valiant lycians held their ground
all fled in terror as they saw their king
piercd through the heart amid a pile of dead
for oer his body many a warrior fell
when saturns son the conflict fierce inflamd
then from sarpedons breast they strippd his arms
of brass refulgent these menoetius son
sent by his comrades to the ships of greece

to phoebus then the cloudcompeller thus
hie thee good phoebus from amid the spears
withdraw sarpedon and from all his wounds
cleanse the dark gore then bear him far away
and lave his body in the flowing stream
then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
anointing clothe him in immortal robes
to two swift bearers give him then in charge
to sleep and death twin brothers in their arms
to bear him safe to lycias widespread plains
there shall his brethren and his friends perform
his funral rites and mound and column raise
the fitting tribute to the mighty dead

he said obedient to his fathers words
down to the battlefield apollo sped
from idas height and from amid the spears
withdrawn he bore sarpedon far away
and lavd his body in the flowing stream
then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
anointing clothd him in immortal robes
to two swift bearers gave him then in charge
to sleep and death twin brothers in their arms
they bore him safe to lycias widespread plains

then to automedon patroclus gave
his orders and the flying foe pursued
oh much deceivd insensate had he now
but borne in mind the words of peleus son
he might have scapd the bitter doom of death
but still joves will the will of man oerrules
who strikes with panic and of victry robs
the bravest and anon excites to war
who now patroclus breast with fury filld
whom then patroclus first whom slewst thou last
when summond by the gods to meet thy doom
adrastus and autonous perimus
the son of meges and echeclus next
epistor melanippus elasus
and mulius and pylartes these he slew
the others all in flight their safety found

then had the greeks the loftygated town
of priam capturd by patroclus hand
so forward and so fierce he bore his spear
but on the wellbuilt towr apollo stood
on his destruction bent and troys defence
the jutting angle of the lofty wall
patroclus thrice assaild his onset thrice
apollo with his own immortal hands
repelling backward thrust his glittring shield
but when again with more than mortal force
he made his fourth attempt with awful mien
and threatning voice the fardestroyer spoke

back heavnborn chief patroclus not to thee
hath fate decreed the triumph to destroy
the warlike trojans city no nor yet
to great achilles mightier far than thou

thus as he spoke patroclus backward steppd
shrinking before the fardestroyers wrath
still hector kept before the scaean gates
his coursers doubtful if again to dare
the battlethrong or summon all the host
to seek the friendly shelter of the wall
thus as he musd beside him phoebus stood
in likeness of a warrior stout and brave
brother of hecuba the uncle thence
of noble hector asius dymas son
who dwelt in phrygia by saugarius stream
his form assuming thus apollo spoke
hector why shrinkst thou from the battle thus
it ill beseems thee would to heavn that i
so far thy greater were as thou art mine
then sorely shouldst thou rue this abstinence
but forward thou against patroclus urge
thy fiery steeds so haply by his death
apollo thee with endless fame may crown

this said the god rejoind the strife of men
and noble hector bade cebriones
drive mid the fight his car before him movd
apollo scattring terror mid the greeks
and lustre adding to the arms of troy
all others hector passd unnoticd by
nor stayd to slay patroclus was the mark
at which his coursers clattring hoofs he drove
on th other side patroclus from his car
leapd to the ground his left hand held his spear
and in the right a pondrous mass he bore
of rugged stone that filld his ample grasp
the stone he hurld not far it missd its mark
nor bootless flew but hectors charioteer
it struck cebriones a bastard son
of royal priam as the reins he held
full on his temples fell the jagged mass
drove both his eyebrows in and crushd the bone
before him in the dust his eyeballs fell
and like a diver from the wellwrought car
headlong he plungd and life forsook his limbs
oer whom patroclus thus with bitter jest
heavn what agility how deftly thrown
that somersault if only in the sea
such feats he wrought with him might few compete
diving for oysters if with such a plunge
he left his boat how rough soeer the waves
as from his car he plunges to the ground
troy can it seems accomplishd tumblers boast

thus saying on cebriones he sprang
as springs a lion through the breast transfixd
in act the sheepfold to despoil and dies
the victim of his courage so didst thou
upon cebriones patroclus spring
down from his car too hector leapd to earth
so oer cebriones opposd they stood
as on the mountain oer a slaughterd stag
both hungerpinchd two lions fiercely fight
so oer cebriones two mighty chiefs
menoetius son and noble hector strove
each in the other bent to plunge his spear
the head with grasp unyielding hector held
patroclus seizd the foot and crowding round
trojans and greeks in stubborn conflict closd

as when encountring in some mountainglen
eurus and notus shake the forest deep
of oak or ash or slender corneltree
whose tapring branches are together thrown
with fearful din and crash of broken boughs
so mixd confusdly greeks and trojans fought
no thought of flight by either entertaind
thick oer cebriones the javlins flew
and featherd arrows bounding from the string
and pondrous stones that on the bucklers rang
as round the dead they fought amid the dust
that eddying rose his art forgotten all
a mighty warrior mightily he lay
while in mid heavn the sun pursued his course
thick flew the shafts and fast the people fell
on either side but when declining day
brought on the hour that sees the loosend steers
the greeks were stronger far and from the darts
and trojan battlecry cebriones
they drew and from his breast his armour strippd
fiercely patroclus on the trojans fell
thrice he assaild them terrible as mars
with fearful shouts and thrice nine foes he slew
but when again with more than mortal force
his fourth assault he made thy term of life
patroclus then approachd its final close
for phoebus awful self encounterd thee
amid the battlethrong of thee unseen
for thickest darkness shrouded all his form
he stood behind and with extended palm
dealt on patroclus neck and shoulders broad
a mighty buffet dizzy swam his eyes
and from his head apollo snatchd the helm
clankd as it rolld beneath the horses feet
the visord helm the horsehair plume with blood
and dust polluted never till that day
was that proud helmet so with dust defild
that wont to deck a godlike chief and guard
achilles noble head and graceful brow
now by the will of jove to hector givn
now death was near at hand and in his grasp
his spear was shiverd pondrous long and tough
brasspointed with its belt the ample shield
fell from his shoulders and apollos hand
the royal son of jove his corslet loosd
then was his mind bewilderd and his limbs
gave way beneath him all aghast he stood
him from behind a dardan panthous son
euphorbus peerless mid the trojan youth
to hurl the spear to run to drive the car
approaching close between the shoulders stabbd
he traind to warfare from his car ere this
a score of greeks had from their chariots hurld
such was the man who thee patroclus first
wounded but not subdued the ashen spear
he in all haste withdrew nor dard confront
patroclus though disarmd in deadly strife

back to his comrades sheltring ranks retird
from certain death patroclus by the stroke
of phoebus vanquishd and euphorbus spear
but hector when patroclus from the fight
he saw retreating wounded through the ranks
advancing smote him through the flank right through
the brazen spear was drivn thundring he fell
and deeply mournd his fall the grecian host

as when a lion hath in fight oerborne
a tusked boar when on the mountain top
they two have met in all their pride of strength
both parchd with thirst around a scanty spring
and vanquishd by the lions force the boar
hath yielded gasping so menoetius son
great deeds achievd at length beneath the spear
of noble hector yielded up his life
who oer the vanquishd thus exulting spoke
patroclus but of late thou madst thy boast
to raze our city walls and in your ships
to bear away to your fardistant land
their days of freedom lost our trojan dames
fool that thou wast nor knewst in their defence
that hectors flying coursers scourd the plain
from them the bravest of the trojans i
avert the day of doom while on our shores
thy flesh shall glut the carrion birds of troy
poor wretch though brave he be yet peleus son
availd thee nought when hanging back himself
with sage advice he sent thee forth to fight
come not to me patroclus carborne chief
nor to the ships return until thou bear
the warriorslayer hectors bloody spoils
torn from his body such were i suppose
his counsels thou poor fool becamst his dupe
to whom patroclus thus in accents faint

hector thou boastest loudly now that jove
with phoebus joind hath thee with victry crownd
they wrought my death who strippd me of my arms
had i to deal with twenty such as thee
they all should perish vanquishd by my spear
me fate hath slain and phoebus and of men
euphorbus thou wast but the third to strike
this too i say and bear it in thy mind
not long shalt thou survive me death een now
and final doom hangs oer thee by the hand
of great achilles peleus matchless son

thus as he spoke the gloom of death his eyes
oerspread and to the shades his spirit fled
mourning his fate his youth and strength cut off
to whom though dead the noble hector thus
patroclus why predict my coming fate
or who can say but fairhaird thetis son
achilles by my spear may first be slain

he said and planting firm his foot withdrew
the brazen spear and backward drove the dead
from off the weapons point then spear in hand
intent to slay automedon pursued
the godlike follower of æacides
but him in safety bore th immortal steeds
the noble prize the gods to peleus gave





nor was patroclus fall by trojans slain
of warlike menelaus unobservd
forward he sprang in dazzling arms arrayd
and round him movd as round her newdroppd calf
her first a heifer moves with plaintive moan
so round patroclus menelaus movd
his shields broad orb and spear before him held
to all who might oppose him threatning death
nor on his side was panthous noble son
unmindful of the slain but standing near
the warlike menelaus thus addressd

illustrious son of atreus heavnborn chief
quit thou the dead yield up the bloody spoils
for of the trojans and their famd allies
mine was the hand that in the stubborn fight
first struck patroclus leave me then to wear
among the men of troy my honours due
lest by my spear thou lose thy cherishd life

to whom in anger menelaus thus
o father jove how ill this vaunting tone
beseems this braggart in their own esteem
with panthous sons for courage none may vie
nor pard nor lion nor the forest boar
fiercest of beasts and proudest of his strength
yet nought availd to hyperenors might
his youthful vigour when he held me cheap
and my encounter dard of all the greeks
he deemd my prowess least yet he i ween
on his own feet returnd not to rejoice
his tender wifes and honourd parents sight
so shall thy pride be quelld if me thou dare
encounter but i warn thee while tis time
ere ill betide thee mid the genral throng
that thou withdraw nor stand to me opposd
after th event may een a fool be wise
he spoke in vain euphorbus thus replied

now heavnborn menelaus shalt thou pay
the forfeit for my brothers life oer whom
slain by thy hand thou makst thy boasting speech
thou in the chambers of her newfound home
hast made his bride a weeping widow thou
hast filld with bittrest grief his parents hearts
some solace might those hapless mourners find
could i thy head and armour in the hands
of panthous and of honourd phrontis place
nor uncontested shall the proof remain
nor long deferrd of victry or defeat

he said and struck the centre of the shield
but broke not through against the stubborn brass
the point was bent then with a prayr to jove
the son of atreus in his turn advancd
and backward as he steppd below his throat
took aim and pressing hard with stalwart hand
drove through the yielding neck the pondrous spear
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang
those locks that with the graces hair might vie
those tresses bright with gold and silver bound
were dabbled all with blood as when a man
hath reard a fair and vigrous olive plant
in some lone spot by copiousgushing springs
and seen expanding nursd by evry breeze
its whitning blossoms till with sudden gust
a sweeping hurricane of wind and rain
uproots it from its bed and prostrate lays
so lay the youthful son of panthous slain
by atreus son and of his arms despoild
and as a lion in the mountains bred
in pride of strength amid the pasturing herd
seizes a heifer in his powrful jaws
the choicest and her neck first broken rends
and on her entrails gorging laps the blood
though with loud clamour dogs and herdsmen round
assail him from afar yet ventures none
to meet his rage for fear is on them all
so none was there so bold with dauntless breast
the noble menelaus wrath to meet
now had atrides borne away with ease
the spoils of panthous son but phoebus grudgd
his prize of victry and against him launchd
the might of hector terrible as mars
to whom his winged words in mentes form
chief of the cicones he thus addressd

hector thy labour all is vain pursuing
pelides flying steeds and hard are they
for mortal man to harness or control
save for achilles self the goddessborn
the valiant menelaus atreus son
defends meanwhile patroclus and een now
hath slain a noble trojan panthous son
euphorbus and his youthful vigour quelld

he said and joind again the strife of men
hectors dark soul with bitter grief was filld
he lookd amid the ranks and saw the two
one slain the other stripping off his arms
the blood outpouring from the gaping wound
forward he sprang in dazzling arms arrayd
loud shouting blazing like the quenchless flames
of vulcan menelaus heard the shout
and troubled commund with his valiant heart

oh woe is me for should i now the spoils
abandon and patroclus who for me
and in my cause lies slain of any greek
who saw me i might well incur the blame
and yet if here alone i dare to fight
with hector and his trojans much i fear
singly to be by numbers overwhelmd
for hector all the trojans hither brings
but wherefore entertain such thoughts my soul
who strives against the will divine with one
belovd of heavn a bitter doom must meet
then none may blame me though i should retreat
from hector who with heavns assistance wars
yet could i hear brave ajax battle cry
we two returning would the encounter dare
een against heavn if so for peleus son
we might regain and bear away the dead
some solace of our loss might then be ours

while in his mind and spirit thus he musd
by hector led the trojan ranks advancd
backward he movd abandoning the dead
but turning oft as when by men and dogs
a bearded lion from the fold is drivn
with shouts and spears yet grieves his mighty heart
and with reluctant step he quits the yard
so from patroclus menelaus movd
yet when he reachd his comrades ranks he turnd
and lookd around if haply he might find
the mighty ajax son of telamon
him on the battles farthest left he spied
cheering his friends and urging to the fight
for sorely phoebus had their courage tried
and hastning to his side addressd him thus

ajax haste hither to the rescue come
of slain patroclus if perchance we two
may to achilles peleus son restore
his body his naked body for his arms
are prize to hector of the glancing helm

he said and ajax spirit within him stirrd
forward he sprang and with him atreus son
hector was dragging now patroclus corpse
stripped of its glittring armour and intent
the head to sever with his sword and give
the mangled carcase to the dogs of troy
but ajax with his towrlike shield approachd
then hector to his comrades ranks withdrew
rushd to his car and bade the trojans bear
the glittring arms his glorious prize to troy
while ajax with his mighty shield oerspread
menoetius son and stood as for his cubs
a lion stands whom hunters unaware
have with his offspring met amid the woods
proud in his strength he stands and down are drawn
covring his eyes the wrinkles of his brow
so oer patroclus mighty ajax stood
and by his side his heart with grief oppressd
the warlike menelaus atreus son

then glaucus leader of the lycian host
to hector thus with scornful glance addressd
his keen reproaches hector fair of form
how art thou wanting in the fight thy fame
coward and runaway thou hast belied
bethink thee now if thou alone canst save
the city aided but by trojans born
henceforth no lycian will go forth for troy
to fight with greeks since favour none we gain
by unremitting toil against the foe
how can a meaner man expect thine aid
who basely to the greeks a prize and spoil
sarpedon leavst thy comrade and thy guest
greatly he servd the city and thyself
while yet he livd and now thou darst not save
his body from the dogs by my advice
if lycians will be ruld we take at once
our homeward way and troy may meet her doom
but if in trojan bosoms there abode
the daring dauntless courage meet for men
who in their countrys cause against the foe
endure both toil and war we soon should see
patroclus brought within the walls of troy
him from the battle could we bear away
and lifeless bring to royal priams town
soon would the greeks sarpedons arms release
and we to iliums heights himself might bear
for with his valiant comrades there lies slain
the follower of the bravest chief of greece
but thou before the mighty ajax stoodst
with downcast eyes nor durst in manly fight
contend with one thy better far confessd

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
with stern regard replied why glaucus speak
brave as thou art in this oerbearing strain
good friend i heretofore have held thee wise
oer all who dwell in lycias fertile soil
but now i change and hold thy judgment cheap
who chargest me with flying from the might
of giant ajax never have i shrunk
from the stern fight and clatter of the cars
but all oerruling is the mind of jove
who strikes with panic and of victry robs
the bravest and anon excites to war
stand by me now and see if through the day
i prove myself the coward that thou sayst
or suffer that a greek how brave soeer
shall rescue from my hands patroclus corpse

he said and loudly on the trojans calld
trojans and lycians and ye dardans famd
in close encounter quit ye now like men
maintain awhile the stubborn fight while i
the splendid armour of achilles don
my glorious prize from slain patroclus torn

so saying hector of the glancing helm
withdrawing from the field with rapid steps
his comrades followd and ere long oertook
who towrd the town achilles armour bore
then standing from the bloody fight aloof
the armour he exchangd his own he bade
the warlike trojans to the city bear
while he of peleus son achilles donnd
the heavnly armour which th immortal gods
gave to his sire he to his son conveyd
yet in that armour grew not old that son

him when apart the cloudcompeller saw
girt with the arms of peleus godlike son
he shook his head and inly thus he musd
ah hapless little deemst thou of thy fate
though now so nigh thou of the prime of men
the dread of all hast donnd th immortal arms
whose comrade brave and good thy hand hath slain
and shamd him stripping from his head and breast
helmet and cuirass yet thy latest hours
will i with glory crown since neer from thee
returnd from battle shall andromache
receive the spoils of peleus godlike son

he said and nodded with his shadowy brows
then with the armour fitted to his form
by jove himself was hector girt by mars
the fierce and terrible with vigrous strength
his limbs were strung as mid his brave allies
he sprang loudshouting glittring in his arms
to all he seemd achilles godlike self
to each and all in cheering tones he spoke
mesthles and glaucus and thersilochus
asteropaeus and hippothous
medon deisenor phoreys chromius
and ennomus the seer to all of these
his winged words he cheeringly addressd

hear me ye countless tribes that dwelling round
assist our cause you from your sevral homes
not for display of numbers have i calld
but that with willing hearts ye should defend
our wives and infants from the warlike greeks
for this i drain my peoples stores for food
and gifts for you exalting your estate
then who will boldly onward he may fall
or safe escape such is the chance of war
but who within our valiant trojans ranks
shall but the body of patroclus bring
despite the might of ajax half the spoils
to him i give the other half myself
retaining and his praise shall equal mine

he said and onward with uplifted spears
they marchd upon the greeks high rose their hopes
from ajax telamon to snatch the dead
vain hopes which cost them many a life then thus
to valiant menelaus ajax spoke

o heavnborn menelaus noble friend
for safe return i dare no longer hope
not for patroclus corpse so much i fear
which soon will glut the dogs and birds of troy
as for my life and thine i tremble now
for like a warcloud hectors might i see
oershadowing all around now is our doom
apparent but do thou for succour call
on all the chiefs if haply they may hear
thus ajax spoke obedient to his word
on all the chiefs atrides calld aloud

o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
all ye that banquet at the genral cost
with atreus sons and oer your sevral states
dominion hold whose honour is of jove
twere hard to call by name each single man
so fierce the combat rages but let each
and all their aid afford and deem it shame
patroclus corpse should glut the dogs of troy

he said first heard oileus active son
and hastning through the fray beside him stood
next him idomeneus with whom there came
valiant as mars his friend meriones
but who can know or tell the names of all
who following swelld the battle of the greeks
onward the trojans pressd by hector led
with such a sound as when the ocean wave
meets on the beach th outpouring of a stream
swolln by the rains of heavn the lofty cliffs
resound and bellows the big sea without
with such a sound advancd the trojan host
while round patroclus with one heart and mind
the greeks a fence of brassclad bucklers raisd
oer their bright helms the son of saturn shed
a veil of darkness for menoetius son
achilles faithful friend while yet he livd
jove hated not nor would that now his corpse
should to the dogs of troy remain a prey
but to the rescue all his comrades stirrd
at first the trojans drove the keeneyd greeks
leaving the corpse they fled nor with their spears
the valiant trojans reachd a single greek
but on the dead they seizd yet not for long
endurd their flight them ajax rallied soon
in form preeminent and deeds of arms
oer all the greeks save peleus matchless son
onward he sprang as springs a mountain boar
which turning in the forest glade to bay
scatters with ease both dogs and stalwart youths
so ajax scatterd soon the trojan ranks
that round patroclus closing hopd to bear
with glory to themselves his corpse to troy
hippothous pelasgian lethus son
was dragging by the feet the noble dead
a leathern belt around his ancles bound
seeking the favour of the men of troy
but on himself he brought destruction down
which none might turn aside for from the crowd
outsprang the son of telamon and struck
in close encounter on the brasscheekd helm
the plumed helm was shiverd by the blow
dealt by a weighty spear and stalwart hand
gushd from the wound the mingled blood and brain
his vital spirit quenchd and on the ground
fell from his powrless grasp patroclus foot
while he himself lay stretchd beside the dead
far from his own larissas teeming soil
not destind he his parents to repay
their early care for short his term of life
by godlike ajax mighty spear subdud

at ajax hector threw his glittring spear
he saw and narrowly the brazen death
escapd but schedius son of iphitus
 below the collarbone
it struck and passing through the brazen point
came forth again beneath his shoulderblade
thundring he fell and loud his armour rang

as phorcys son of phaenops kept his watch
oer slain hippothous him ajax smote
below the waist the weighty spear broke through
the hollow breastplate and th intestines tore
prone in the dust he fell and clutchd the ground
at this the trojan chiefs and hectors self
gan to give way the greeks with joyful shouts
seizd both the dead and strippd their armour off
to ilium now before the warlike greeks
oercome by panic had the trojans fled
and now had greeks despite the will of jove
by their own strength and courage won the day
had not apollos self æneas rousd
in likeness of a herald periphas
the son of epytus now aged grown
in service of æneas aged sire
a man of kindliest soul his form assumd
apollo and æneas thus addressd

æneas how against the will of heavn
could ye defend your city as others now
in their own strength and courage confident
their numbers and their troops undaunted hearts
i see their cause maintaining if when jove
rather to us than them the victry wills
with fear unspeakable ye shun the fight

he said the presence of the archergod
æneas knew and loud to hector calld
hector and all ye other chiefs of troy
and brave allies foul shame it were that we
oercome by panic should to ilium now
in flight be drivn before the warlike greeks
and by my side but now some god there stood
and told how jove the sovreign arbiter
of battle on our side bestowd his aid
on then nor undisturbed allow the greeks
to bear patroclus body to their ships

he said and far before the ranks advancd
they rallying turnd and facd again the greeks
then first æneas spear the comrade brave
of lycomedes struck laocritus
son of arisbas lycomedes saw
with pitying eyes his gallant comrades fall
and standing near his glittring spear he threw
and through the midriff apisaon struck
his peoples guardian chief the valiant son
of hippasus and slackd his limbs in death
he from paeonias fertile fields had come
oer all his comrades eminent in fight
all save asteropaeus who with eyes
of pity saw his gallant comrades fall
and forward sprang to battle with the greeks
yet could not force his way for all around
patroclus rose a fence of serried shields
and spears projecting such the orders givn
by ajax and with earnest care enforcd
that from around the dead should none retire
nor any to the front advance alone
before his fellows but their steady guard
maintain and hand to hand the battle wage
so orderd ajax then with crimson blood
the earth was wet and hand to hand they fell
trojans alike and brave allies and greeks
for neither these a bloodless fight sustaind
though fewer far their losses for they stood
of mutual succour mindful and support
thus furious as the rage of fire they fought
nor might ye deem the glorious sun himself
nor moon was safe for darkest clouds of night
oerspread the warriors who the battle wagd
around the body of menoetius son
elsewhere the trojans and the wellgreavd greeks
fought undisturbd in the clear light of day
the suns bright beams were shed abroad no cloud
lay on the face of earth or mountain tops
they but by fits at distant intervals
and far apart each seeking to avoid
the hostile missiles fought but in the midst
the bravest all in darkness and in strife
sore pressd toild on beneath their armours weight

as yet no tidings of patroclus fall
had reachd two valiant chiefs antilochus
and thrasymedes but they deemd him still
alive and fighting in the foremost ranks
they witnessing their comrades flight and death
fought on apart by nestor so enjoind
when from the ships he bade them join the fray
great was meanwhile their labour who sustaind
throughout the livelong day that weary fight
reekd with continuous toil and sweat the knees
and legs and feet the arms and eyes of all
who round achilles faithful comrade fought
as when a chief his people bids to stretch
a huge bulls hide all drenchd and soakd with grease
they in a circle rangd this way and that
pull the tough hide till entring in the grease
is all absorbd and draggd by numrous hands
the supple skin to th utmost length is stretchd
so these in narrow space this way and that
the body draggd and high the hopes of each
to bear it off in triumph to their ships
the greeks to troy the trojans fiercely ragd
the struggle spiritstirring mars himself
or pallas to her utmost fury rousd
had not that struggle with contempt beheld
such grievous labour oer patroclus corpse
had jove to horses and to men decreed

but of patroclus fall no tidings yet
had reachd achilles for the war was wagd
far from the ships beneath the walls of troy
nor lookd he of his death to hear but deemd
that when the trojans to their gates were drivn
he would return in safety for no hope
had he of taking by assault the town
with or without his aid for oft apart
his goddessmother had his doom foretold
revealing to her son the mind of jove
yet neer had warnd him of such grief as this
which now befell his dearest comrades loss

still round the dead they held their pointed spears
fought hand to hand and mutual slaughter dealt
and thus perchance some brassclad greek would say

o friends twere shameful should we to the ships
ingloriously return ere that should be
let earth engulph us all so better far
than let these trojans to their city bear
our dead and boast them of their triumph gaind
on th other hand some valiant trojan thus
would shout o friends tho fate decreed that here
we all should die yet let not one give way

thus cheering each his comrades would they speak
and thus they fought the iron clangour piercd
the empty air and brazen vault of heavn
but from the fight withdrawn achilles steeds
wept as they heard how in the dust was laid
their charioteer by hectors murdrous hand
automedon diores valiant son
essayd in vain to rouse them with the lash
in vain with honeyd words in vain with threats
nor to the ships would they return again
by the broad hellespont nor join the fray
but as a column stands which marks the tomb
of man or woman so immovable
beneath the splendid car they stood their heads
downdrooping to the ground while scalding tears
droppd earthward from their eyelids as they mournd
their charioteer and oer the yokeband shed
down streamd their ample manes with dust defild
the son of saturn pitying saw their grief
and sorrowing shook his head as thus he musd

ah hapless horses wherefore gave we you
to royal peleus to a mortal man
you that from age and death are both exempt
was it that you the miseries might share
of wretched mortals for of all that breathe
and walk upon the earth or creep is nought
more wretched than th unhappy race of man
yet shall not ye nor shall your wellwrought car
by hector son of priam be controlld
i will not suffer it enough for him
to hold with vaunting boast achilles arms
but to your limbs and spirits will i impart
such strength that from the battle to the ships
ye shall in safety bear automedon
for yet i will the trojans shall prevail
and slay until they reach the wellmannd ships
till sets the sun and darkness shrouds the earth

he said and in their breasts fresh spirit infusd
they shaking from their manes the dust the car
amid the greeks and trojans lightly bore
then as a vulture mid a flock of geese
amid the battle rushd automedon
his horses course directing and their speed
exciting though he mournd his comrade slain
swiftly he fled from out the trojan host
swiftly again assaild them in pursuit
yet speedy to pursue he could not slay
nor in the car alone had powr at once
to guide the flying steeds and hurl the spear
at length a comrade brave alcimedon
laerces son beheld behind the car
he stood and thus automedon addressd
automedon what god has filld thy mind
with counsels vain and thee of sense bereft
that with the trojans in the foremost ranks
thou fain wouldst fight alone thy comrade slain
while hector proudly on his breast displays
the glorious arms of great æacides

to whom automedon diores son
alcimedon since none of all the greeks
may vie with thee the mettle to control
of these immortal horses save indeed
while yet he livd patroclus godlike chief
but him stern death and fate have overtaen
take thou the whip and shining reins while i
descending from the car engage in fight

he said and mounting on the warcar straight
alcimedon the whip and reins assumd
down leapd automedon great hector saw
and thus addressd æneas at his side

æneas prince and counsellor of troy
i see committed to unskilful hands
achilles horses on the battlefield
these we may hope to take if such thy will
for they methinks will scarcely stand opposd
or dare th encounter of our joint assault

he said anchises valiant son complied
forward they went their shoulders coverd oer
with stout bullshide thick overlaid with brass
with them both chromius and aretus went

and high their hopes were raisd the warriors both
to slay and make the strongneckd steeds their prize
blind fools nor destind scatheless to escape
automedons encounter he his prayr
to jove addressd and straight with added strength
his soul was filld and to alcimedon
his trusty friend and comrade thus he spoke

alcimedon do thou the horses keep
not far away but breathing on my neck
for hectors might will not i deem be stayd
ere us he slay and mount achilles car
and carry terror mid the grecian host
or in the foremost ranks himself be slain

thus spoke automedon and loudly calld
on menelaus and th ajaces both
ye two ajaces leaders of the host
and menelaus with our bravest all
ye on the dead alone your care bestow
to guard him and stave off the hostile ranks
but haste and us the living save from death
for hector and æneas hitherward
with weight oerpowring through the bloody press
the bravest of the trojans force their way
yet is the issue in the hands of heavn
i hurl the spear but jove directs the blow

he said and poising hurld the pondrous spear
full on aretus broadorbd shield it struck
nor stayd the shield its course the brazen point
drove through the belt and in his body lodgd
as with sharp axe in hand a stalwart man
striking behind the horns a sturdy bull
severs the neck he forward plunging falls
so forward first he sprang then backwards fell
and quivring in his vitals deep infixd
the sharp spear soon relaxd his limbs in death
then at automedon great hector threw
his glittring spear he saw and forward stoopd
and shunnd the brazen death behind him far
deep in the soil infixd with quivring shaft
the weapon stood there mars its impulse stayd
and now with swords and hand to hand the fight
had been renewd but at their comrades call
the two ajaces pressing through the throng
between the warriors interposd in haste
before them hector and æneas both
and godlike chromius in alarm recoild
piercd through the heart aretus there they left
and terrible as mars automedon
strippd off his arms and thus exulting cried
of some small portion of its load of grief
for slain patroclus is my heart relievd
in slaying thee all worthless as thou art

then throwing on the car the bloody spoils
he mounted hands and feet imbrued with blood
as twere a lion fresh from his repast
upon the carcase of a slaughterd bull

again around patroclus body ragd
the stubborn conflict direful sorrowfraught
from heavn descending pallas stirrd the strife
sent by allseeing jove to stimulate
the warlike greeks so changed was now his will
as oer the face of heavn when jove extends
his brighthued bow a sign to mortal men
of war or wintry storms which bid surcease
the rural works of man and pinch the flocks
so pallas in a brighthued cloud arrayd
passd through the ranks and rousd each sevral man
to noble menelaus atreus son
who close beside her stood the goddess first
the form of phoenix and his powrful voice
assuming thus her stirring words addressd

on thee o menelaus foul reproach
will fasten if achilles faithful friend
the dogs devour beneath the walls of troy
then hold thou firm and all the host inspire

to whom thus menelaus good in fight
o phoenix aged warrior honourd sire
if pallas would the needful powr impart
and oer me spread her aegis then would i
undaunted for patroclus rescue fight
for deeply by his death my heart is touchd
but valiant hector with the strength of fire
still rages and destruction deals around
for jove is with him and his triumph wills

he said the blueeyd goddess heard with joy
that chief of all the gods her aid he sought
she gave fresh vigour to his arms and knees
and to his breast the boldness of the fly
which oft repelld by man renews th assault
incessant lurd by taste of human blood
such boldness in atrides manly breast
pallas inspird beside patroclus corpse
again he stood and poisd his glittring spear

there was one podes in the trojan ranks
son of eetion rich of blameless life
of all the people most to hector dear
and at his table oft a welcome guest
him as he turnd to fly beneath the waist
atrides struck right through the spear was drivn
thundring he fell and atreus son the corpse
draggd from the trojans mid the ranks of greece

then close at hectors side apollo stood
clad in the form of phaenops asius son
who in abydos dwelt of all th allies
honourd of hector most and best belovd
clad in his form the fardestroyer spoke

hector what other greek will scare thee next
who shrinkst from menelaus heretofore
a warrior deemd of no repute but now
alone he robs our trojans of their dead
and in the foremost ranks een now hath slain
podes thine own good friend eetions son

he said dark grief oerclouded hectors brow
as to the front in dazzling arms he sprang
then saturns son his tasselld aegis wavd
all glittring bright and idas lofty head
in clouds and darkness shrouded then he bade
his lightning flash his volleying thunder roar
that shook the mountain and with victry crownd
the trojan arms and panicstruck the greeks

the first who turnd to fly was peneleus
bœotian chief him facing still the foe
a spear had slightly on the shoulder struck
the bone just grazing by polydamas
who close before him stood the spear was thrown
then hector leitus aloctryons son
thrust thro the wrist and quelld his warlike might
trembling he lookd around nor hopd again
the trojans spear in hand to meet in fight
but onward as he rushd on leitus
idomeneus at hector threw his spear
full on his breast it struck but near the head
the sturdy shaft was on the breastplate snappd
loud was the trojans shout and he in turn
aimd at idomeneus deucalions son
upstanding on his car his mark he missd
but coeranus he struck the charioteer
and faithful follower of meriones
who with him came from lyctus thriving town
the chief had left on foot the welltrimmd ships
and had not coeranus his car in haste
drivn to the rescue by his fall had givn
a trojan triumph to his lord he brought
safety and rescue from unsparing death
but fell himself by hectors murdrous hand
him hector struck between the cheek and ear
crashing the teeth and cutting through the tongue
headlong he fell to earth and droppd the reins
these stooping from the car meriones
caught up and thus idomeneus addressd

ply now the lash until thou reach the ships
thyself must see how crushd the strength of greece

he said and towrd the ships idomeneus
urgd his fleet steeds for fear was on his soul
nor did not ajax and atrides see
how in the trojans favour saturns son
the wavring scale of victry turnd and thus
great ajax telamon his grief expressd

o heavn the veriest child might plainly see
that jove the trojans triumph has decreed
their weapons all by whomsoever thrown
or weak or strong attain their mark for jove
directs their course while ours upon the plain
innocuous fall but take we counsel now
how from the fray to bear away our dead
and by our own return rejoice those friends
who look with sorrow on our plight and deem
that we all powrless to resist the might
of hectors arm beside the ships must fall
would that some comrade were at hand to bear
a message to achilles him i ween
as yet the mournful tidings have not reachd
that on the field his dearest friend lies dead
but such i see not for a veil of cloud
oer men and horses all around is spread
o father jove from oer the sons of greece
remove this cloudy darkness clear the sky
that we may see our fate and die at least
if such thy will in th open light of day

he said and pitying jove beheld his tears
the clouds he scatterd and the mist dispersd
the sun shone forth and all the field was clear
then ajax thus to menelaus spoke

now heavnborn menelaus look around
if haply mid the living thou mayst see
antilochus the noble nestors son
and bid him to achilles bear in haste
the tidings that his dearest friend lies dead

he said nor did atrides not comply
but slow as moves a lion from the fold
which dogs and youths with ceaseless toil hath worn
who all night long have kept their watch to guard
from his assault the choicest of the herd
he hungerpinchd hath oft th attempt renewd
but nought prevaild by spears on evry side
and javlins met wielded by stalwart hands
and blazing torches which his courage daunt
till with the morn he sullenly withdraws
so from patroclus with reluctant step
atrides movd for much he feard the greeks
might to the trojans panicstruck the dead
abandon and departing he besought
the two ajaces and meriones
ye two ajaces leaders of the greeks
and thou meriones remember now
our lost patroclus gentle courtesy
how kind and genial was his soul to all
while yet he livdnow sunk alas in death

thus saying menelaus took his way
casting his glance around on evry side
like to an eagle famd of sharpest sight
of all that fly beneath the vault of heavn
whom soaring in the clouds the crouching hare
eludes not though in leafiest covert hid
but swooping down he rends her life away
so menelaus through the ranks of war
thy piercing glances evry way were turnd
if nestors son alive thou mightst descry
him on the fields extremest left he found
cheering his friends and urging to the fight
he stood beside him and addressd him thus

antilochus come hither godlike friend
and woful tidings hear which would to heavn
i had not to impart thyself thou seest
how jove hath heapd disaster on the greeks
and victry givn to troy but one has fallen
our bravest best patroclus lies in death
and deeply must the greeks his loss deplore
but haste thee to the ships to peleus son
the tidings bear if haply he may save
the body of patroclus from the foe
his naked body for his arms are now
the prize of hector of the glancing helm

he said and at his words antilochus
astounded stood long time his tongue in vain
for uttrance strove his eyes were filld with tears
his cheerful voice was mute yet not the less
to menelaus bidding gave his care
swiftly he sped but to laodocus
his comrade brave who waited with his car
in close attendance first consignd his arms
then from the field with active limbs he flew
weeping with mournful news to peleus son
nor noble menelaus did thy heart
incline thee to remain and aid thy friends
where from their warworn ranks the pylian troops
deplord the absence of antilochus
but these in godlike thrasymedes charge
he left and to patroclus hastning back
beside th ajaces stood as thus he spoke
him to achilles to the ships in haste
i have despatchd yet fiercely as his wrath
may burn towrd hector i can scarce expect
his presence here for how could he unarmd
with trojans fight but take we counsel now
how from the field to bear away our dead
and scape ourselves from death by trojan hands

whom answerd thus great ajax telamon
illustrious menelaus all thy words
are just and true then from amid the press
thou and meriones take up in haste
and bear away the body while behind
we two in heart united as in name
who side by side have still been wont to fight
will hector and his trojans hold at bay

he said they lifting in their arms the corpse
upraisd it high in air then from behind
loud yelld the trojans as they saw the greeks
retiring with their dead and on they rushd
as dogs that in advance of hunter youths
pursue a wounded boar awhile they run
eager for blood but when in pride of strength
he turns upon them backward they recoil
this way and that in fear of death dispersd
so onward pressd awhile the trojan crowd
with thrust of swords and doublepointed spears
but ever as th ajaces turnd to bay
their colour changd to pale not one so bold
as dashing on to battle for the corpse
thus they with anxious care from off the field
bore towrd the ships their dead but on their track
came sweeping on the storm of battle fierce
as on a sudden breaking forth the fire
seizes some populous city and devours
house after house amid the glare and blaze
while roar the flames before the gusty wind
so fiercely pressed upon the greeks retreat
the clattring tramp of steeds and armed men
but as the mules with stubborn strength endued
that down the mountain through the trackless waste
drag some huge log or timber for the ships
and spent with toil and sweat still labour on
unflinching so the greeks with patient toil
bore on their dead th ajaces in their rear
stemming the war as stems the torrents force
some wooded cliff far stretching oer the plain
checking the mighty rivers rushing stream
and flinging it aside upon the plain
itself unbroken by the strength of flood
so firmly in the rear th ajaces stemmd
the trojan force yet these still onward pressd
and mid their comrades proudly eminent
two chiefs æneas old anchises son
and glorious hector in the van were seen
then as a cloud of starlings or of daws
fly screaming as they see the hawk approach
to lesser birds the messenger of death
so before hector and æneas fled
screaming forgetful of their warlike fame
the sons of greece and scatterd here and there
around the ditch lay store of goodly arms
by greeks abandond in their hasty flight
yet still unintermitted ragd the war





thus furious as the rage of fire they fought
meantime antilochus to peleus son
swiftfooted messenger his tidings bore
him by the highbeakd ships he found his mind
th event presaging filld with anxious thoughts
as thus he commund with his mighty heart

alas what means it that the longhaird greeks
chasd from the plain are thronging round the ships
let me not now ye gods endure the grief
my mother once foretold that i should live
to see the bravest of the myrmidons
cut off by trojans from the light of day
menoetius noble son has surely falln
foolhardy yet i warnd him and besought
soon as the ships from hostile fires were safe
back to return nor hectors onset meet

while in his mind and spirit thus he musd
beside him stood the noble nestors son
and weeping thus his mournful message gave

alas great son of peleus woful news
which would to heavn i had not to impart
to thee i bring patroclus lies in death
and oer his body now the war is wagd
his naked body for his arms are now
the prize of hector of the glancing helm

he said and darkest clouds of grief oerspread
achilles brow with both his hands he seizd
and pourd upon his head the grimy dust
marring his graceful visage and defild
with blackning ashes all his costly robes
stretchd in the dust his lofty stature lay
as with his hands his flowing locks he tore
loud was the wailing of the female band
achilles and patroclus prize of war
as round achilles rushing out of doors
beating their breasts with tottring limbs they pressd
in tears beside him stood antilochus
and in his own achilles hand he held
groaning in spirit fearful lest for grief
in his own bosom he should sheathe his sword
loud were his moans his goddessmother heard
beside her aged father where she sat
in the deep ocean caves she heard and wept
the nereids all in oceans depths who dwell
encircled her around cymodoce
nesaee spio and cymothoe
the stageyd halia and amphithoe
actaea limnorea melite
doris and galatea panope
there too were oreithyia clymene
and amathea with the golden hair
and all the denizens of oceans depths
filld was the glassy cave in unison
they beat their breasts as thetis led the wail

give ear my sister nereids all and learn
how deep the grief that in my breast i bear
me miserable me of noblest son
unhappiest mother me a son who bore
my brave my beautiful of heroes chief
like a young tree he throve i tended him
in a rich vineyard as the choicest plant
till in the beaked ships i sent him forth
to war with troy him neer shall i behold
returning home in aged peleus house
een while he lives and sees the light of day
he lives in sorrow nor to soothe his grief
my presence can avail yet will i go
that i may see my dearest child and learn
what grief hath reachd him from the war withdrawn

she said and left the cave with her they went
weeping before them parted th ocean wave
but when they reachd the fertile shore of troy
in order due they landed on the beach
where frequent round achilles swift of foot
were moord the vessels of the myrmidons
there as he groand aloud beside him stood
his goddessmother weeping in her hands
she held his head while pitying thus she spoke

why weeps my son and what his cause of grief
speak out and nought conceal for all thy prayr
which with uplifted hands thou madst to jove
he hath fulfilld that flying to their ships
the routed sons of greece should feel how much
they need thine aid and mourn their insult past

to whom achilles deeply groaning thus
mother all this indeed hath jove fulfilld
yet what avails it since my dearest friend
is slain patroclus whom i honourd most
of all my comrades lovd him as my soul
him have i lost and hector from his corpse
hath strippd those arms those weighty beauteous arms
a marvel to behold which from the gods
peleus receivd a glorious gift that day
when they consignd thee to a mortals bed
how better were it if thy lot had been
still mid the ocean deities to dwell
and peleus had espousd a mortal bride
for now is bitter grief for thee in store
mourning thy son whom to his home returnd
thou never more shalt see nor would i wish
to live and move amid my fellowmen
unless that hector vanquishd by my spear
may lose his forfeit life and pay the price
of foul dishonour to patroclus done

to whom her tears oerflowing thetis thus
een as thou sayst my son thy term is short
nor long shall hectors fate precede thine own

achilles answring spoke in passionate grief
would i might die this hour who faild to save
my comrade slain far from his native land
he died sore needing my protecting arm
and i who neer again must see my home
nor to patroclus nor the many greeks
whom hectors hand hath slain have renderd aid
but idly here i sit cumbring the ground
i who amid the greeks no equal own
in fight to others in debate i yield
accursd of gods and men be hateful strife
and anger which to violence provokes
een temprate souls though sweeter be its taste
than dropping honey in the heart of man
swelling like smoke such anger in my soul
hath agamemnon kindled king of men
but pass we that though still my heart be sore
yet will i school my angry spirit down
in search of hector now of him who slew
my friend i go prepard to meet my death
when jove shall will it and th immortals all
from death not een the might of hercules
though best belovd of saturns son could fly
by fate and junos bitter wrath subdued
i too since such my doom must lie in death
yet ere i die immortal fame will win
and from their delicate cheeks deepbosomd dames
dardan and trojan bitter tears shall wipe
and groan in anguish then shall all men know
how long i have been absent from the field
then though thou love me seek not from the war
to stay my steps for bootless were thy speech

whom answerd thus the silverfooted queen
true are thy words my son and good it is
and commendable from the stroke of death
to save a worsted comrade but thine arms
thy brazen flashing arms the trojans hold
them hector of the glancing helm himself
bears on his breast exulting yet not long
shall be his triumph for his doom is nigh
but thou engage not in the toils of war
until thine eyes again behold me here
for with tomorrows sun will i return
with arms of heavnly mould by vulcan wrought

thus saying from her son she turnd away
and turning to her sister nereids spoke
back to the spacious bosom of the deep
retire ye now and to my fathers house
the aged ocean god your tidings bear
while i to high olympus speed to crave
at vulcans hand the skilld artificer
a boon of dazzling armour for my son

she said and they beneath the ocean wave
descended while to high olympus sped
the silverfooted goddess thence in hope
to bear the dazzling armour to her son
she to olympus sped the greeks meanwhile
before the warriorslayer hector fled
with wild tumultuous uproar till they reachd
their vessels and the shore of hellespont
nor had the wellgreavd greeks achilles friend
patroclus from amid the fray withdrawn
for close upon him followd horse and man
and hector son of priam fierce as flame
thrice noble hector seizing from behind
sought by the feet to drag away the dead
cheering his friends thrice clad in warlike might
the two ajaces drove him from his prey
yet fearless in his strength now rushing on
he dashd amid the fray now shouting loud
stood firm but backward not a step retird
as from a carcase herdsmen strive in vain
to scare a tawny lion hungerpinchd
een so th ajaces mailclad warriors faild
the son of priam from the corpse to scare
and now the body had he borne away
with endless fame but from olympus height
came stormswift iris down to peleus son
and bade him don his arms by juno sent
unknown to jove and to th immortals all
she stood beside him and addressd him thus

up son of peleus up thou prince of men
haste to patroclus rescue whom around
before the ships is wagd a fearful war
with mutual slaughter these the dead defending
and those to iliums breezy heights intent
to bear the body noble hector chief
who longs to sever from the tender neck
and fix upon the spikes thy comrades head
up then delay no longer deem it shame
patroclus corpse should glut the dogs of troy
dishonring thee if aught dishonour him

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
say heavnly iris of th immortal gods
who bade thee seek me and this message bring

to whom swift iris thus to thee i come
by juno sent th imperial wife of jove
unknown to saturns son and all the gods
who on olympus snowy summit dwell

to whom again achilles swift of foot
how in the battle toil can i engage
my arms are with the trojans and to boot
my mother warnd me not to arm for fight
till i again should see her for she hopd
to bring me heavnly arms by vulcan wrought
nor know i well whose armour i could wear
save the broad shield of ajax telamon
and he methinks amid the foremost ranks
evn now is fighting oer patroclus corpse

whom answerd stormswift iris well we know
thy glorious arms are by the trojans held
but go thou forth and from above the ditch
appear before them daunted at the sight
haply the trojans may forsake the field
and breathingtime afford the sons of greece
toilworn for little pause has yet been theirs

swift iris said and vanishd then uprose
achilles dear to jove and pallas threw
her tasselld aegis oer his shoulders broad
his head encircling with a coronet
of golden cloud whence fiery flashes gleamd
as from an island city up to heavn
the smoke ascends which hostile forces round
beleaguer and all day with cruel war
from its own state cut off but when the sun
hath set blaze frequent forth the beacon fires
high rise the flames and to the dwellers round
their signal flash if haply oer the sea
may come the needful aid so brightly flashd
that fiery light around achilles head
he left the wall and stood above the ditch
but from the greeks apart remembring well
his mothers prudent counsel there he stood
and shouted loudly pallas joind her voice
and filld with terror all the trojan host
clear as the trumpets sound which calls to arms
some town encompassd round with hostile bands
rang out the voice of great æacides
but when achilles voice of brass they heard
they quaild in spirit the sleekskind steeds themselves
conscious of coming ill bore back the cars
their charioteers dismayd beheld the flame
which kindled by the blueeyd goddess blazd
unquenchd around the head of peleus son
thrice shouted from the ditch the godlike chief
thrice terror struck both trojans and allies
and there and then beside their chariots fell
twelve of their bravest while the greeks well pleasd
patroclus body from the fray withdrew
and on a litter laid around him stood
his comrades mourning with them peleus son
shedding hot tears as on his friend he gazd
laid on the bier and piercd with deadly wounds
him to the war with horses and with cars
he sent but neer to welcome his return
by stageyd juno sent reluctant sank
th unwearied sun beneath the ocean wave
the sun had set and breathd awhile the greeks
from the fierce labours of the balancd field
nor less the trojans from the stubborn fight
retiring from the chariots loosd their steeds
but ere they shard the evning meal they met
in council all stood up none dard to sit
for fear had fallen on all when reappeard
achilles from the battle long withdrawn
first panthous son the sage polydamas
addressd th assembly his sagacious mind
alone beheld the future and the past
the friend of hector born the selfsame night
one in debate the other best in arms
who thus with prudent speech began and said

be well advisd my friends my counsel is
that we regain the city nor the morn
here in the plain beside the ships await
so far removd from our protecting walls
while fiercely burnd gainst atreus godlike son
that mighty warriors wrath twas easier far
with th other greeks to deal and i rejoicd
when by the ships we passd the night in hopes
we soon might call them ours but now i own
achilles swift of foot excites my fear
his proud impetuous spirit will spurn the plain
where greeks and trojans oft in warlike strife
their balancd strength exert if he come forth
our fight will be to guard our homes and wives
gain we the city trust me so twere best
now for a while ambrosial night detains
the son of peleus but at early morn
if issuing forth in arms he find us here
his prowess we shall know and happy he
who flying shall in safety reach the walls
of sacred troy for many a trojan slain
shall feed the vultures heavn avert such fate
but if though loth ye will by me be ruld
this night in council husband we our strength
while towrs and lofty gates and folding doors
close joind wellfitting shall our city guard
then issuing forth in arms at early morn
man we the towrs so harder were his task
if from the ships advancing round the wall
he offer battle bootless to return
his strongneckd horses worn with labour vain
in coursing purposeless around the town
to force an entrance or the town destroy
is not his aim and ere that end be gaind
the dogs of troy upon his flesh shall feed

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
with stern regard polydamas thy words
are such as grate unkindly on mine ear
who fain wouldst have us to the walls retire
what have ye not already long enough
been coopd within the towrs the wealth of troy
its brass its gold were once the common theme
of evry tongue our hoarded treasures now
are gone to phrygian and maeonian shores
for sale exported costly merchandise
since on our city fell the wrath of jove
and now when deepdesigning saturns son
such glory gives me as to gain the ships
and crowded by the sea hem in the greeks
fool put not thou these timid counsels forth
which none will follow nor will i allow
but hear ye all and do as i advise
share now the meal by ranks throughout the host
then set your watch and each keep careful guard
and whom his spoils oerload if such there be
let him divide them with the genral crowd
better that they should hold them than the greeks
and with the morn in arms beside the ships
will we again awake the furious war
but if indeed achilles by the ships
hath reappeard himself if so he choose
shall be the suffrer from the perilous strife
i will not shrink but his encounter meet
so he or i shall gain immortal fame
impartial mars hath oft the slayer slain

thus hector spoke the trojans cheerd aloud
fools and by pallas of their sense bereft
who all applauded hectors ill advice
none the sage counsel of polydamas
then through the camp they shard the evning meal

meantime the greeks all night with tears and groans
bewaild patroclus on his comrades breast
achilles laid his murderdealing hands
and led with bitter groans the loud lament
as when the hunters in the forests depth
have robbd a bearded lion of his cubs
too late arriving he with anger chafes
then follows if perchance he may oertake
through many a mountain glen the hunters steps
with grief and fury filld so peleus son
with bitter groans the myrmidons addressd

vain was alas the promise which i gave
seeking the brave menoetius to console
to bring to opus back his gallant son
rich with his share of spoil from troy oerthrown
but jove fulfils not all that man designs
for us hath fate decreed that here in troy
we two one soil should redden with our blood
nor me returning to my native land
shall aged peleus in his halls receive
nor thetis here must earth retain my bones
but since patroclus i am doomd on earth
behind thee to remain thy funral rites
i will not celebrate till hectors arms
and head thy haughty slayers here i bring
and on thy pyre twelve noble sons of troy
will sacrifice in vengeance of thy death
thou by our beaked ships till then must lie
and weeping oer thee shall deepbosomd dames
trojan and dardan mourn both night and day
the prizes of our toil when wealthy towns
before our valour and our spears have falln

he said and bade his comrades on the fire
an ample tripod place without delay
to cleanse patroclus from the bloody gore
they on the burning fire the tripod placd
with water filld and kindled wood beneath
around the bellying tripod rose the flames
heating the bath within the glittring brass
soon as the water boild they washd the corpse
with lissom oils anointing and the wounds
with fragrant ointments filld of nine years old
then in fine linen they the body wrappd
from head to feet and laid it on a couch
and coverd over with a fair white sheet
all night around achilles swift of foot
the myrmidons with tears patroclus mournd

to juno then his sister and his wife
thus saturns son at length thou hast thy will
imperial juno who hast stirrd to war
achilles swift of foot well might one deem
these longhaird greeks from thee derivd their birth

to whom in answer thus the stageyd queen
what words dread son of saturn dost thou speak
een man though mortal and inferior far
to us in wisdom might so much effect
against his fellowman then how should i
by double title chief of goddesses
first by my birth and next because thy wife
i boast me thine oer all the gods supreme
not work my vengeance on the trojan race

such converse while they held to vulcans house
immortal starlike bright among the gods
unrivalld all of brass by vulcans self
constructed sped the silverfooted queen
him sweltring at his forge she found intent
on forming twenty tripods which should stand
the wall surrounding of his wellbuilt house
with golden wheels beneath he furnishd each
and to th assembly of the gods endued
with powr to move spontaneous and return
a marvel to behold thus far his work
he had completed but not yet had fixd
the richwrought handles these his labour now
engagd to fit them and to rivet fast
while thus he exercisd his practisd skill
the silverfooted queen approachd the house
charis the skilful artists wedded wife
beheld her coming and advancd to meet
and as her hand she claspd addressd her thus

say thetis of the flowing robe belovd
and honourd whence this visit to our house
an unaccustomd guest but come thou in
that i may welcome thee with honour due

thus as she spoke the goddess led her in
and on a seat with silver studs adornd
fair richly wrought a footstool at her feet
she bade her sit then thus to vulcan calld
haste hither vulcan thetis asks thine aid

whom answerd thus the skilld artificer
an honourd and a venerated guest
our house contains who savd me once from woe
when by my mothers act from heavn i fell
who for that i was crippled in my feet
deemd it not shame to hide me hard had then
my fortune been had not eurynome
and thetis in their bosoms shelterd me
eurynome from old oceanus
who drew her birth the evercircling flood
nine years with them i dwelt and many a work
i fashiond there of metal clasps and chains
of spiral coil rich cups and collars fair
hid in a cave profound where th ocean stream
with ceaseless murmur foamd and moand around
unknown to god or man but to those two
who savd me thetis and eurynome
now to my house hath fairhaird thetis come
to her my life preservd its tribute owes
then thou the hospitable rites perform
while i my bellows and my tools lay by

he said and from the anvil reard upright
his massive strength and as he limpd along
his tottering knees were bowd beneath his weight
the bellows from the fire he next withdrew
and in a silver casket placd his tools
then with a sponge his brows and lusty arms
he wipd and sturdy neck and hairy chest
he donnd his robe and took his weighty staff
then through the door with halting step he passd
there waited on their king the attendant maids
in form as living maids but wrought in gold
instinct with consciousness with voice endued
and strength and skill from heavnly teachers drawn
these waited duteous at the monarchs side
his steps supporting he with halting gait
passd to a gorgeous chair by thetis side
and as her hand he claspd addressd her thus

say thetis of the flowing robe belovd
and honourd whence this visit to our house
an unaccustomd guest say what thy will
and if within my powr esteem it done

to whom in answer thetis weeping thus
vulcan of all the goddesses who dwell
on high olympus lives there one whose soul
hath borne such weight of woe so many griefs
as saturns son hath heapd on me alone
me whom he chose from all the seaborn nymphs
and gave to peleus son of æacus
his subject i endurd a mortals bed
though sore against my will he now bent down
by feeble age lies helpless in his house
now adds he farther grief he granted me
to bear and rear a son of heroes chief
like a young tree he throve i tended him
in a rich vineyard as the choicest plant
till in the beaked ships i sent him forth
to war with troy him neer shall i receive
returning home in aged peleus house
een while he lives and sees the light of day
he lives in sorrow nor to soothe his grief
my presence can avail a girl his prize
selected for him by the sons of greece
great agamemnon wrested from his arms
in grief and rage he pind his soul away
then by the trojans were the greeks hemmd in
beside their ships and from within their camp
no outlet found the grecian elders then
implord his aid and promisd costly gifts
with his own hand to save them he refusd
but in his armour clad to battle sent
his friend patroclus with a numrous band
all day they fought before the scaean gates
and in that day had ilium been destroyd
but in the van menoetius noble son
after great deeds achievd apollo slew
and crownd with glory hector priams son
therefore a suppliant to thy knees i come
if to my son to early death condemnd
thou wilt accord the boon of shield and helm
and wellwrought greaves with silver clasps securd
and breastplate for his own his faithful friend
by trojan hands subdued hath lost and he
oerwhelmd with grief lies prostrate on the earth

whom answerd thus the skilld artificer
take comfort nor let this disturb thy mind
would that as surely when his hour shall come
i could defend him from the stroke of death
as i can undertake that his shall be
such arms as they shall marvel who behold

he left her thus and to his forge returnd
the bellows then directing to the fire
he bade them work through twenty pipes at once
forthwith they pourd their diversetemperd blasts
now briskly seconding his eager haste
now at his will and as the work requird
the stubborn brass and tin and precious gold
and silver first he melted in the fire
then on its stand his weighty anvil placd
and with one hand the hammers pondrous weight
he wielded while the other graspd the tongs

and first a shield he fashiond vast and strong
with rich adornment circled with a rim
threefold brightgleaming whence a silver belt
depended of five folds the shield was formd
and on its surface many a rare design
of curious art his practisd skill had wrought

thereon were figurd earth and sky and sea
the evercircling sun and fullorbd moon
and all the signs that crown the vault of heavn
pleiads and hyads and orions might
and arctos calld the wain who wheels on high
his circling course and on orion waits
sole star that never bathes in th ocean wave

and two fair populous towns were sculpturd there
in one were marriage pomp and revelry
and brides in gay procession through the streets
with blazing torches from their chambers borne
while frequent rose the hymeneal song
youths whirld around in joyous dance with sound
of flute and harp and standing at their doors
admiring women on the pageant gazd

meanwhile a busy throng the forum filld
there between two a fierce contention rose
about a deathfine to the public one
appeald asserting to have paid the whole
while one denied that he had aught receivd
both were desirous that before the judge
the issue should be tried with noisy shouts
their several partisans encouragd each
the heralds stilld the tumult of the crowd
on polishd chairs in solemn circle sat
the revrend elders in their hands they held
the loudvoicd heralds sceptres waving these
they heard th alternate pleadings in the midst
two talents lay of gold which he should take
who should before them prove his righteous cause

before the second town two armies lay
in arms refulgent to destroy the town
th assailants threatend or among themselves
of all the wealth within the city stord
an equal half as ransom to divide
the terms rejecting the defenders mannd
a secret ambush on the walls they placd
women and children musterd for defence
and men by age enfeebled forth they went
by mars and pallas led these wrought in gold
in golden arms arrayd above the crowd
for beauty and stature as befitting gods
conspicuous shone of lesser height the rest
but when the destind ambuscade was reachd
beside the river where the shepherds drove
their flocks and herds to water down they lay
in glittring arms accoutred and apart
they placd two spies to notify betimes
th approach of flocks of sheep and lowing herds
these in two shepherds charge ere long appeard
who unsuspecting as they movd along
enjoyd the music of their pastral pipes
they on the booty from afar discernd
sprang from their ambuscade and cutting off
the herds and fleecy flocks their guardians slew
their comrades heard the tumult where they sat
before their sacred altars and forthwith
sprang on their cars and with faststepping steeds
pursued the plundrers and oertook them soon
there on the rivers bank they met in arms
and each at other hurld their brazen spears
and there were figurd strife and tumult wild
and deadly fate who in her iron grasp
one newlywounded one unwounded bore
while by the feet from out the press she draggd
another slain about her shoulders hung
a garment crimsond with the blood of men
like living men they seemd to move to fight
to drag away the bodies of the slain

and there was gravn a wideextended plain
of fallow land rich fertile mellow soil
thrice ploughd where many ploughmen up and down
their teams were driving and as each attaind
the limit of the field would one advance
and tender him a cup of genrous wine
then would he turn and to the end again
along the furrow cheerly drive his plough
and still behind them darker showd the soil
the true presentment of a newploughd field
though wrought in gold a miracle of art

there too was gravn a cornfield rich in grain
where with sharp sickles reapers plied their task
and thick in even swathe the trusses fell
the binders following close the bundles tied
three were the binders and behind them boys
in close attendance waiting in their arms
gatherd the bundles and in order pild
amid them staff in hand in silence stood
the king rejoicing in the plenteous swathe
a little way removd the heralds slew
a sturdy ox and now beneath an oak
prepard the feast while women mixd hard by
white barley porridge for the labrers meal

and with rich clusters laden there was gravn
a vineyard fair all gold of glossy black
the bunches were on silver poles sustaind
around a darksome trench beyond a fence
was wrought of shining tin and through it led
one only path by which the bearers passd
who gatherd in the vineyards bounteous store
there maids and youths in joyous spirits bright
in woven baskets bore the luscious fruit
a boy amid them from a cleartond harp
drew lovely music well his liquid voice
the strings accompanied they all with dance
and song harmonious joind and joyous shouts
as the gay bevy lightly trippd along

of straighthornd cattle too a herd was gravn
of gold and tin the heifers all were wrought
they to the pasture from the cattleyard
with gentle lowings by a babbling stream
where quivring reedbeds rustled slowly movd
four golden shepherds walkd beside the herd
by nine swift dogs attended then amid
the foremost heifers sprang two lions fierce
upon the lordly bull he bellowing loud
was draggd along by dogs and youths pursued
the tough bullshide they tore and gorging lappd
th intestines and dark blood with vain attempt
the herdsmen following closely to the attack
cheerd their swift dogs these shunnd the lions jaws
and close around them baying held aloof

and there the skilful artists hand had tracd
a pastaro broad with fleecy flocks oerspread
in a fair glade with fold and tents and pens

there too the skilful artists hand had wrought
with curious workmanship a mazy dance
like that which daedalus in cnossus erst
at fairhaird ariadnes bidding framd
there laying each on others wrists their hand
bright youths and manysuitord maidens dancd
in fair white linen these in tunics those
well woven shining soft with fragrant oils
these with fair coronets were crownd while those
with golden swords from silver belts were girt
now whirld they round with nimble practisd feet
easy as when a potter seated turns
a wheel new fashiond by his skilful hand
and spins it round to prove if true it run
now featly movd in wellbeseeming ranks
a numrous crowd around the lovely dance
surveyd delighted while an honourd bard
sang as he struck the lyre and to the strain
two tumblers in the midst were whirling round

about the margin of the massive shield
was wrought the mighty strength of th ocean stream

the shield completed vast and strong he forgd
a breastplate dazzling bright as flame of fire
and next a weighty helmet for his head
fair richly wrought with crest of gold above
then last wellfitting greaves of pliant tin

the skilld artificer his works complete
before achilles goddessmother laid
she like a falcon from the snowclad heights
of huge olympus darted swiftly down
chargd with the glittring arms by vulcan wrought




now morn in saffron robe from th ocean stream
ascending light diffusd oer gods and men
as thetis to the ships returning bore
the gift of vulcan there her son she found
who oer patroclus hung in bitter grief
around him mournd his comrades in the midst
she stood and claspd his hand as thus she spoke

leave we my son though deep our grief the dead
here let him lie since heavn hath doomd his fall
but thou these arms receive by vulcan sent
fairer than eer on mortal breast were borne
the arms before achilles as she spoke
the goddess laid loud rang the wondrous work
with awe the myrmidons beheld nor dard
affront the sight but as achilles gazd
more fiery burnd his wrath beneath his brows
his eyes like lightning flashd with fierce delight
he seizd the glorious gift and when his soul
had feasted on the miracle of art
to thetis thus his winged words addressd

mother the god hath givn me arms indeed
worthy a god and such as mortal man
could never forge i go to arm me straight
yet fear i for menoetius noble son
lest in his spearinflicted wounds the flies
may gender worms and desecrate the dead
and life extinct corruption reach his flesh

whom answerd thus the silverfooted queen
let not such fears my son disturb thy mind
i will myself the swarms of flies disperse
that on the flesh of slaughterd warriors prey
and should he here remain a year complete
still should his flesh be firm and fresh as now
but thou to council call the chiefs of greece
against the monarch agamemnon there
the leader of the host abjure thy wrath
then arm thee quickly and put on thy might

her words with dauntless courage filld his breast
she in patroclus nostrils to preserve
his flesh red nectar and ambrosia pourd

along the ocean beach achilles passd
and loudly shouting calld on all the chiefs
then all who heretofore remaind on board
the steersmen who the vessels rudders hold
the very stewards that servd the daily bread
all to th assembly throngd when reappeard
achilles from the fight so long withdrawn
two noble chiefs two ministers of mars
ulysses sage and valiant diomed
appeard yet crippled by their grievous wounds
their halting steps supporting with their spears
and on the foremost seats their places took
next followd agamemnon king of men
he also wounded for antenors son
coon had stabbd him in the stubborn fight
when all the greeks were closely throngd around
up rose achilles swift of foot and said

great son of atreus what hath been the gain
to thee or me since heartconsuming strife
hath fiercely ragd between us for a girl
who would to heavn had died by dians shafts
that day when from lyrnessus capturd town
i bore her off so had not many a greek
bitten the bloody dust by hostile hands
subdued while i in anger stood aloof
great was the gain to troy but greeks methinks
will long retain the memry of our feud
yet pass we that and though our hearts be sore
still let us school our angry spirits down
my wrath i here abjure it is not meet
it burn for ever unappeasd do thou
muster to battle straight the longhaird greeks
that to the trojans once again opposd
i may make trial if beside the ships
they dare this night remain but he i ween
will gladly rest his limbs who safe shall fly
my spear escaping from the battlefield

he said the wellgreavd greeks rejoicd to hear
his wrath abjurd by peleus godlike son
and from his seat not standing in the midst
thus to th assembly agamemnon spoke
friends grecian heroes ministers of mars
when one stands up to speak tis meet for all
to lend a patient ear nor interrupt
for een to practisd speakers hard the task
but in this vast assembly who can speak
that all may hear the clearest voice must fail
to peleus son achilles i my mind
will frankly open ye among yourselves
impart the words i speak that all may know
oft hath this matter been by greeks discussd
and i their frequent censure have incurrd
yet was not i the cause but jove and fate
and gloomy erinnys who combind to throw
a strong delusion oer my mind that day
i robbd achilles of his lawful prize
what could i do a goddess all oerruld
daughter of jove dread ate baleful powr
misleading all with lightest step she moves
not on the earth but oer the heads of men
with blighting touch and many hath causd to err
een jove the wisest deemd of gods and men
in error she involvd when junos art
by female stratagem the god deceivd
when in wellgirdled thebes alcmena lay
in travail of the might of hercules
in boastful tone amid the gods he spoke
hear all ye gods and all ye goddesses
the words i speak the promptings of my soul
this day lucina shall to light bring forth
a child the future lord of all around
of mortal men who trace to me their blood
whom answerd juno thus with deep deceit
thou dost but feign nor wilt fulfil thy word
come now olympian swear a solemn oath
that he shall be the lord of all around
who on this day shall be of woman born
of mortal men who trace to thee their blood
she said and jove the snare unseeing swore
a solemn oath but found his error soon
down from olympus height she sped in haste
to argos of achaia for the wife
of sthenelus the son of perseus there
she knew was sevn months pregnant of a son
whom though untimely born she brought to light
staying meanwhile alcmenas labourpangs
to saturns son herself the tidings brought
and thus addressd him jove the lightnings lord
i bring thee news this day a mighty man
by thee ordaind to be the argives king
is born eurystheus son of sthenelus
the son of perseus issue of thy blood
well worthy he to be the argives king
she said keen sorrow deeply piercd his soul
then ate by the glossy locks he seizd
in mighty wrath and swore a solemn oath
that to olympus and the starry heavn
she never should return who all misleads
his arm then whirling from the starry heavn
he flung her down to vex th affairs of men
yet oft her fraud rememberd he with groans
when by eurystheus hard commands he saw
condemnd to servile tasks his noble son
so oft as hector of the glancing helm
beside the ships the greeks to slaughter gave
back to my mind my former error came
i errd for jove my judgment took away
but friendly reconcilement now i seek
and tender costly presents then thyself
uprouse thee and excite the rest to arms
while i prepare the gifts whateer of late
the sage ulysses promisd in thy tent
or if thou wilt though eager for the fray
remain thou here awhile till from my ship
my followers bring the gifts that thou mayst see
i make my offerings with no niggard hand

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
most mighty agamemnon king of men
the gifts thou deemst befitting tis for thee
to give or to withhold but now at once
prepare we for the battle tis not meet
on trivial pretexts here to waste our time
or idly loiter much remains to do
again be seen achilles in the van
scattring with brazen spear the trojan ranks
and ye forget not man with man to fight

to whom in answer sage ulysses thus
brave as thou art achilles godlike chief
yet fasting lead not forth the sons of greece
to fight the trojans for no little time
will last the struggle when the serried ranks
are once engagd in conflict and the gods
with equal courage either side inspire
but bid them by the ships of food and wine
 first partake
for none throughout the day till set of sun
fasting from food may bear the toils of war
his spirit may still be eager for the fray
yet are his limbs by slow degrees weighd down
himself by thirst and hunger worn his knees
unable as he moves to bear his weight
but he who first with food and wine refreshd
all day maintains the combat with the foe
his spirit retains unbroken and his limbs
unwearied till both armies quit the field
disperse then now the crowd and bid prepare
the morning meal meantime to public view
let agamemnon king of men display
his costly gifts that all the greeks may see
and that thy heart within thee melt with joy
and there in full assembly let him swear
a solemn oath that he hath neer approachd
the fair briseis bed nor held with her
such intercourse as man with woman holds
be thou propitious and accept his oath
then at a sumptuous banquet in his tent
let him receive thee that thine honour due
may nothing lack and so atrides thou
shalt stand in sight of all men clear of blame
for none can wonder that insulting speech
should rouse the anger of a sceptred king

to whom thus agamemnon king of men
son of laertes i accept thy speech
with cordial welcome all that thou hast said
is well and wisely spoken for the oath
i am prepard with willing mind to swear
nor in the sight of heavn will be forsworn
let then achilles here awhile remain
though eager for the fray ye too remain
until the presents from my tent be brought
and we our solemn compact ratify
then this command upon thyself i lay
that thou the noblest youths of all the greeks
select and bid them from my vessel bear
the gifts which to achilles yesternight
we promisd and withal the women bring
and let talthybius through the host seek out
a boar for sacrifice to jove and sol

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
most mighty agamemnon king of men
these matters to some future time were best
deferrd some hour of respite from the fight
of rage less fiercely burning in my breast
but slaughterd now they lie whom priams son
hector hath slain by jove to victry led
ye bid us take our food if i might rule
i would to battle lead the sons of greece
unfed and fasting and at set of sun
our shame avengd an ample feast prepare
till then nor food nor drink shall pass my lips
my comrade slain who piercd with mortal wounds
turnd towrd the doorway lies within my tent
his mourning friends around while there he lies
no thought have i for these or aught beside
save carnage blood and groans of dying men

to whom ulysses sage in council thus
o son of peleus noblest of the greeks
how far achilles thou surpassest me
in deeds of arms i know but thou must yield
to me in counsel for my years are more
and my experience greater far than thine
then to my words incline a patient ear
men soonest weary of battle where the sword
the bloodiest harvest reaps the lightest crop
of slaughter is where jove inclines the scale
dispenser at his will of human wars
the greeks by fasting cannot mourn their dead
for day by day successive numbers fall
where were the respite then from ceaseless fast
behoves us bury out of sight our dead
steeling our hearts and weeping but a day
and we the rest whom cruel war has spard
should first with food and wine recruit our strength
then girding on our arms the livelong day
maintain the war unwearied then let none
require a farther summons to the field
 but with united force
against the trojans wake the furious war

he said and calld on noble nestors sons
on meges phyleus son meriones
thoas and lycomedes creons son
and melanippus they together sought
the mighty monarch agamemnons tent
soon as the word was givn the work was done
sevn tripods brought they out the promisd gifts
twelve horses twenty caldrons glittring bright
sevn women too well skilld in household cares
with whom the eighth the fair briseis came
ulysses led the way and with him brought
ten talents full of gold th attendant youths
the other presents bore and in the midst
displayd before th assembly then uprose
the monarch agamemnon by his side
with voice of godlike powr talthybius stood
holding the victim then atrides drew
the dagger ever hanging at his side
close by the scabbard of his mighty sword
and from the victims head the bristles shore
with hands uplifted then to jove he prayd
while all around the greeks in silence stood
listning decorous to the monarchs words
as looking up to heavn he made his prayr

be witness jove thou highest first of gods
and sun and earth and ye who vengeance wreak
beneath the earth on souls of men forsworn
furies that never or to love unchaste
soliciting or otherwise my hand
hath fair briseis touchd but in my tent
still pure and undefild hath she remaind
and if in this i be forsworn may heavn
with all the plagues afflict me due to those
who sin by perjurd oaths against the gods

thus as he spoke across the victims throat
he drew the pitiless blade talthybius then
to hoary oceans depths the carcase threw
food for the fishes then achilles rose
and thus before th assembled greeks he spoke

o father jove how dost thou lead astray
our human judgments neer had atreus son
my bosom filld with wrath nor from my arms
to his own loss against my will had torn
the girl i lovd but that the will of jove
to death predestind many a valiant greek
now to the meal anon renew the war

this said th assembly he dismissd in haste
the crowd dispersing to their sevral ships
upon the gifts the warlike myrmidons
bestowd their care and bore them to the ships
of peleus godlike son within the tent
they laid them down and there the women placd
while to the drove the followers led the steeds
briseis fair as golden venus saw
patroclus lying piercd with mortal wounds
within the tent and with a bitter cry
she flung her down upon the corpse and tore
her breast her delicate neck and beauteous cheeks
and weeping thus the lovely woman waild

patroclus dearly lovd of this sad heart
when last i left this tent i left thee full
of healthy life returning now i find
only thy lifeless corpse thou prince of men
so sorrow still on sorrow heapd i bear
the husband of my youth to whom my sire
and honourd mother gave me i beheld
slain with the sword before the city walls
three brothers whom with me one mother bore
my dearly lovd ones all were doomd to death
nor wouldst thou when achilles swift of foot
my husband slew and royal mynes town
in ruin laid allow my tears to flow
but thou wouldst make me 
the wedded wife of peleus godlike son
thou wouldst to phthia bear me in thy ship
and there thyself amid the myrmidons
wouldst give my marriage feast then unconsold
i weep thy death my evergentle friend

weeping she spoke the women joind her wail
patroclus death the pretext for their tears
but each in secret wept her private griefs

around achilles throngd the elder men
urging to eat but he with groans refusd
i pray you would you show your love dear friends
ask me not now with food or drink to appease
hunger or thirst a load of bitter grief
weighs heavy on my soul till set of sun
fasting will i remain and still endure

the other monarchs at his word withdrew
the two atridae and ulysses sage
and nestor and idomeneus remaind
and aged phoenix to divert his grief
but comfort none save in the bloody jaws
of battle would he take by memry stirrd
he heavd a deepdrawn sigh as thus he spoke

how oft hast thou illfated dearest friend
here in this tent with eager zeal prepard
the tempting meal wheneer the sons of greece
in haste would arm them for the bloody fray
now liest thou there while i for love of thee
from food and drink before me placd refrain
for neer shall i again such sorrow know
not though i heard of aged peleus death
who now in phthia mourns with tender tears
his absent son he on a foreign shore
is warring in that hateful helens cause
no nor of his who now in scyros isle
is growing up if yet indeed he live
young neoptolemus my godlike son
my hope had been indeed that here in troy
far from the plains of argos i alone
was doomd to die and that to phthia thou
returnd in safety mightst my son convey
from scyros home and show him all my wealth
my spoils my slaves my lofty spacious house
for peleus or to death methinks een now
hath yielded or not far from death removd
lives on in sorrow bowd by gloomy age
expecting day by day the messenger
who bears the mournful tidings of my death

weeping achilles spoke and with him wept
the elders each to fond remembrance movd
of all that in his home himself had left
the son of saturn pitying saw their grief
and pallas thus with winged words addressd
my child dost thou a heros cause forsake
or does achilles claim no more thy care
who sits in sorrow by the highprowd ships
mourning his comrade slain the others all
partake the meal while he from food abstains
then haste thee and with hunger lest he faint
drop nectar and ambrosia on his breast

his words fresh impulse gave to pallas zeal
down like the longwingd falcon shrill of voice
thro the clear sky she swoopd and while the greeks
armd for the fight achilles she approachd
and nectar and ambrosia on his breast
distilld lest hunger should his strength subdue
back to her mighty fathers ample house
returning as from out the ships they pourd
thick as the snowflakes that from heavn descend
before the skyborn boreas chilling blast
so thick outpouring from the ships the stream
of helmets polishd bright and bossy shields
and breastplates firmly bracd and ashen spears
their brightness flashd to heavn and laughd the earth
beneath the brazen glare loud rang the tramp
of armed men achilles in the midst
the godlike chief in dazzling arms arrayd
his teeth were gnashing audibly his eye
blazd with the light of fire but in his heart
was grief unbearable with furious wrath
he burnd against the trojans as he donnd
the heavnly gifts the work of vulcans hand
first on his legs the wellwrought greaves he fixd
fastend with silver clasps his breastplate next
around his chest and oer his shoulders flung
his silverstudded sword with blade of brass
then took his vast and weighty shield whence gleamd
a light refulgent as the fullorbd moon
or as to seamen oer the wave is borne
the watchfires light which high among the hills
some shepherd kindles in his lonely fold
as they reluctant by the stormy winds
far from their friends are oer the waters drivn
so from achilles shield bright richly wrought
the light was thrown the weighty helm he raisd
and placd it on his head the plumed helm
shone like a star and wavd the hairs of gold
thickset by vulcan in the gleaming crest
then all the arms achilles provd to know
if well they fitted to his graceful limbs
like wings they seemd to lift him from the ground
last from its case he drew his fathers spear
long pondrous tough not one of all the greeks
none save achilles self could poise that spear
the farfamd pelian ash which to his sire
on pelions summit felld to be the bane
of mighty chiefs the centaur chiron gave
with care automedon and alcimus
the horses yokd with collars fair attachd
placd in their mouths the bits and passd the reins
back to the wellbuilt car automedon
sprang on the car with shining lash in hand
behind achilles came arrayd for war
in arms all glittring as the gorgeous sun
and loudly to his fathers steeds he calld
xanthus and balius noble progeny
of swift podarge now in other sort
back to the grecian ranks in safety bear
when he shall quit the field your charioteer
nor leave him as ye left patroclus slain

to whom in answer from beneath the yoke
xanthus the noble horse with glancing feet
bowing his head the while till all his mane
down from th yokeband streaming reachd the ground
by juno whitearmd queen with speech endued

yes great achilles we this day again
will bear thee safely but thy day of doom
is nigh at hand nor we shall cause thy death
but heavns high will and fates imperious powr
by no default of ours nor lack of speed
the trojans strippd patroclus of his arms
the mighty god fairhaird latonas son
achievd his death and hectors victry gaind
our speed of foot may vie with zephyrs breeze
deemd swiftest of the winds but thou art doomd
to die by force combind of god and man

he said his farther speech the furies stayd
to whom in wrath achilles swift of foot
xanthus why thus predict my coming fate
it ill beseems thee well i know myself
that i am fated here in troy to die
far from my home and parents yet withal
i cease not till these trojans from the field
before me fly he said and to the front
his warcry shouting urgd his fiery steeds





round thee achilles eager for the fray
stood thus accoutred by their beaked ships
the sons of greece the trojan host opposd
stood on the sloping margin of the plain
then jove to themis gave command to call
the gods to council from the lofty height
of manyridgd olympus to the house
of jove she summond them from evry side
thence of the rivers save oceanus
not one was absent nor of nymphs who haunt
clear fount or shady grove or grassy mead
they at the cloudcompellers house arrivd
within the polishd corridor reclind
which vulcans cunning hand for jove had built
there were they gatherd in th abode of jove
nor did th earthshaking neptune slight the call
but came from oceans depths and in the midst
he sat and thus the will of jove enquird

why lord of lightning hast thou summond here
the gods to council dost thou aught devise
touching the greeks and trojans who een now
kindle anew it seems the blaze of war

to whom the cloudcompeller answring thus
the purpose neptune well thou knowst thyself
for which i calld ye true they needs must die
but still they claim my care yet here will i
upon olympus lofty ridge remain
and view serene the combat you the rest
go as you list to trojans or to greeks
and at your pleasure either party aid
for if we leave achilles thus alone
to fight against the trojans not an hour
will they before the son of peleus stand
they dreaded him before but now i fear
since rousd to fury by his comrades death
he een in fates despite may storm the wall

thus saturns son and quenchless battle rousd
the gods divided hastend to the war
juno and pallas to the ships of greece
with them th earthshaker and the helpful god
hermes for cunning subtleties unmatchd
and vulcan too exulting in his strength
yet halting and on feeble limbs sustaind
mars of the glancing helm took part with troy
and golden phoebus with his locks unshorn
latona too and dian archerqueen
xanthus and venus laughterloving dame

while from the fight of men the gods abstaind
high rose the grecian vaunts as long withdrawn
achilles on the field again appeard
and evry trojans limbs with terror quakd
trembling as peleus godlike son they saw
in arms allglittring fierce as bloodstaind mars
but when th immortals mingled in the throng
then furious waxd the spiritstirring strife
then pallas raisd her warcry standing now
beside the deepdug trench without the wall
now shouting loud along the sounding beach
on th other side as with the tempests roar
mars to the trojans shouted loud one while
from iliums topmost height anon again
from the fair hill oerhanging simois stream
thus either side exciting to the fray
th immortal gods unchaind the angry war
thunderd on high the sire of gods and men
with awful din while neptune shook beneath
the boundless earth and lofty mountain tops
the springabounding ida quakd and rockd
from her firm basis to her loftiest peak
and troys proud city and the ships of greece
pluto th infernal monarch heard alarmd
and springing from his throne cried out in fear
lest neptune breaking through the solid earth
to mortals and immortals should lay bare
his dark and drear abode of gods abhorrd
such was the shock when gods in battle met
for there to royal neptune stood opposd
phoebus apollo with his arrows keen
the blueeyd pallas to the god of war
to juno dian heavnly archeress
sister of phoebus goldenshafted queen
stout hermes helpful god latona facd
while vulcan met the mighty rolling stream
xanthus by gods by men scamander calld
thus gods encounterd gods achilles soul
meantime was burning mid the throng to meet
hector the son of priam with whose blood
he longd to glut th insatiate lord of war
apollo then the spiritstirring god
æneas movd achilles to confront
and filld with courage high and thus the voice
assuming of lycaon priams son
apollo son of jove the chief addressd

æneas prince and councillor of troy
where are the vaunts which oer the winecup late
thou madst amid th assembled chiefs of troy
that hand to hand thou wouldst achilles meet

to whom æneas thus in answer spoke
why son of priam urge me to contend
against my will with peleus mighty son
not for the first time should i now engage
achilles swift of foot i met him once
and fled before his spear on idas hill
when on our herds he fell lyrnessus then
he razd and pedasus me jove preservd
with strength endowing and with speed of foot
else had i falln beneath achilles hand
by pallas aided who before him moves
light of his life and guides his brazen spear
trojans and leleges alike to slay
tis not in mortal man with him to fight
whom still some god attends and guards from harm
and een unaided to the mark his spear
unerring flies uncheckd until it pierce
a warriors breast yet if the gods the scale
impartial held all brassclad as he is
oer me no easy triumph should he gain

to whom the king apollo son of jove
brave chief do thou too to th immortal gods
address thy prayr men say that thou art sprung
from venus child of jove his mother owns
a humbler origin one born to jove
the other to the aged ocean god
on then with dauntless spear nor be dismayd
by his high tone and vaunting menaces

his words with courage filld the heros breast
and on he sprang in dazzling arms arrayed
but not unmarkd of whitearmd juno passd
to meet achilles through the press of men
who thus addressd the gods to council calld

neptune and pallas both bethink ye well
what now should be our course æneas comes
in dazzling arms arrayd to meet in fight
the son of peleus phoebus sends him forth
say then shall we encountring to retreat
perforce constrain him or shall one of us
beside achilles stand and give him strength
that he may nothing lack and know himself
by all the mightiest of th immortal gods
belovd and those how powrless by whose aid
the trojans yet maintain defensive war
therefore to join the battle came we all
from high olympus that in this days fight
no ill befall him though the time shall come
for him to meet the doom by fate decreed
when at his birth his thread of life was spun
but if achilles from a voice divine
receive not this assurance he may well
be struck with fear if haply to some god
he find himself opposd tis hard for man
to meet in presence visible a god

to whom earthshaking neptune thus replied
juno thine anger carry not too far
it ill beseems thee not with my consent
shall we the stronger far provoke to arms
the other gods but rather from the field
retiring let us from on high survey
to mortals left the turmoil of the war
should mars or phoebus then begin the fight
or stay achilles and his arm restrain
then in the contest we too may engage
and soon methinks will they be fain to join
drivn from the field the synod of the gods
subdued perforce by our victorious hands

the darkhaird monarch spoke and led the way
to the high wall by trojans built of old
with pallas aid for godlike hercules
within whose circle he might safety seek
when from the beach the monster of the deep
might chase him toward the plain there neptune sat
and with him the other gods a veil of cloud
impenetrable around their shoulders spread
on th other side upon the fair hills brow
phoebus with mars the fortdestroyer sat
on either side they sat each facing each
with hostile counsels yet reluctant both
to take th initiative of ruthless war
till jove enthrond on high the signal gave
then all the plain with men and horses throngd
the brazen gleam illumind rang the earth
beneath their feet as to the battleshock
they rushd but in the midst both hosts between
eager for fight stood forth two warriors bold
proudly preeminent anchises son
æneas and achilles godlike might

æneas first with threatning mien advancd
nodding his pondrous helm before his breast
his shield he bore and poisd his brazen spear
him met achilles from th opposing ranks
fierce as a ravning lion whom to slay
pour forth the stalwart youths th united strength
of the rousd village he unheeding moves
at first but wounded by a javlin thrown
by some bold youth he turns with gaping jaws
and frothing fangs collecting for the spring
his breast too narrow for his mighty heart
and with his tail he lashes both his flanks
and sides as though to rouse his utmost rage
then on in pride of strength with glaring eyes
he dashes if some hunter he may slay
or in the foremost rank himself be slain
so movd his dauntless spirit peleus son
æneas to confront when near they came
thus first achilles swift of foot began

æneas why so far before the ranks
advancd dost thou presume with me to fight
perchance expecting that the throne of troy
and priams royal honours may be thine
een if thou slay me deem not to obtain
such boon from priam valiant sons are his
and he not weak but bears a constant mind
or have the trojans set apart for thee
some favourd spot the fairest of the land
orchard or cornland shouldst thou work my death
which thou shalt find i trust too hard a task
already hast thou fled before my spear
hast thou forgotten how amid thy herds
alone i found thee and with flying foot
pursued thee down the steep of idas hill
nor didst thou dare to turn or pause in flight
thou to lyrnessus fleddst lyrnessus i
with pallas aid and joves assaild and took
their women thence their days of freedom lost
i bore away my captives thee from death
jove and the other gods defended then
but will not now bestow though such thy hope
their succour then i warn thee while tis time
ere ill betide thee to the genral throng
that thou withdraw nor stand to me opposd
after th event may een a fool be wise

to whom in answer thus æneas spoke
achilles think not me as though a fool
to daunt with lofty speech i too could well
with cutting words and insult answer thee
each others race and parents well we know
from tales of ancient days although by sight
nor mine to thee nor thine to me are known
to noble peleus thou tis said wast born
of thetis fairhaird daughter of the sea
of great anchises heavndescended chief
i boast me sprung to him by venus borne
of these shall one or other have this day
to mourn their son since not with empty words
shall thou and i from mortal combat part
but if thou farther wouldst enquire and learn
the race i spring from not unknown to men
by dardanus of cloudcompelling jove
begotten was dardania peopled first
ere sacred ilium populous city of men
was founded on the plain as yet they dwelt
on springabounding idas lowest spurs
to dardanus was erichthonius born
great king the wealthiest of the sons of men
for him were pasturd in the marshy mead
rejoicing with their foals three thousand mares
them boreas in the pasture where they fed
beheld enamourd and amid the herd
in likeness of a coalblack steed appeard
twelve foals by him conceiving they producd
these oer the teeming cornfields as they flew
skimmd oer the standing ears nor broke the haulm
and oer wide oceans bosom as they flew
skimmd oer the topmost spray of th hoary sea
again to erichthonius tros was born
the king of troy three noble sons were his
ilus assaracus and ganymede
the fairest he of all the sons of men
him for his beauty bore the gods away
to minister as cupbearer to jove
and dwell amid th immortals ilus next
begot a noble son laomedon
tithonus he and priam clytius
lampus and icetaon plant of mars
capys begotten of assaracus
begot anchises and anchises me
to priam godlike hector owes his birth
such is my race and such the blood i boast
but jove at will to mortals valour gives
or minishes for he is lord of all
then cease we now like babbling fools to prate
here in the centre of the coming fight
terms of reproach we both might find whose weight
would sink a galley of a hundred oars
for glibly runs the tongue and can at will
give uttrance to discourse in evry vein
wide is the range of language and such words
as one may speak another may return
what need that we should insults interchange
like women who some paltry quarrel wage
scolding and brawling in the public street
and in opprobrious terms their anger vent
some true some false for so their rage suggests
with words thou shalt not turn me from the field
till we have met in arms then try we now
each others prowess with our brazen spears

he said and hurld against the mighty shield
his brazen spear loud rang the weapons point
and at arms length achilles held the shield
with his broad hand in fear that through its folds
æneas spear would easy passage find
blind fool forgetful that the glorious gifts
bestowd by gods are not with ease oercome
nor yield before th assaults of mortal men

so broke not through æneas sturdy spear
stayd by the golden plate the gift of heavn
yet through two plates it passd but three remaind
for five were in the shield by vulcan wrought
two were of brass the inner two of tin
and one of gold which stayd the brazen spear

achilles threw in turn his pondrous spear
and struck the circle of æneas shield
near the first rim where thinnest lay the brass
and thinnest too th oerlying hide right through
the pelian shaft was drivn wide gapd the shield
æneas crouchd in fear as oer his head
he held his shield the eager weapon passd
through both the circles of his ample shield
and in the ground behind him quivring stood
escapd the pondrous weapon sharpest pain
flashing across his eyes in fear he stood
so close the spear had passd him onward then
drawing his trenchant blade achilles rushd
with fearful shout a rocky fragment then
æneas lifted up a mighty mass
which scarce two men as men are now could bear
but he unaided lifted it with ease
then had æneas with the massive stone
or on the helmet or the shield his death
averting struck achilles and himself
had by the sword of peleus son been slain
had not th earthshaking god his peril seen
and to th immortals thus addressd his speech
oh woe is me for great æneas sake
who by achilles slain must visit soon
the viewless shades insensate who relied
on phoebus words yet nought shall he avail
from death to save him yet oh why should he
blameless himself the guilt of others rue
who still his grateful sacrifice hath paid
to all the gods in widespread heavn who dwell
let us then interpose to guard his life
lest if achilles slay him saturns son
be movd to anger for his destiny
would have him live lest heirless from the earth
should perish quite the race of dardanus
by saturns son the bestbelovd of all
his sons to him by mortal women born
for jove the race of priam hath abhorrd
but oer the trojans shall æneas reign
and his sons sons through ages yet unborn

whom answerd thus the stageyd queen of heavn
neptune do thou determine for thyself
æneas to withdraw or leave to fall
good as he is beneath achilles sword
but we before th immortal gods are bound
both i and pallas by repeated oaths
neer from his doom one trojan life to save
though to devouring flames a prey all troy
were blazing kindled by the valiant greeks

th earthshaker heard and thro the fight he passd
and through the throng of spears until he came
where great achilles and æneas stood
around the eyes of peleus son he spread
a veil of mist then from æneas shield
the brasstippd spear withdrawing laid it down
before achilles feet and lifting up
æneas bore him high above the ground
oer many a rank of warriors and of cars
æneas flew supported by the god
till to the fields extremest verge he came
where stood the caucons arming for the war
there to æneas standing by his side
th earthshaker thus his winged words addressd
æneas say what god has movd thee thus
against achilles reckless to contend
thy stronger far and dearer to the gods
if eer he cross thy path do thou retire
lest een despite of fate thou find thy death
but when achilles hath to fate succumbd
then fearless with the foremost join the fray
no other greek shall bear away thy spoils

thus plainly warnd æneas there he left
then from achilles eyes he purgd the film
astonishd he with eyes wide open gazd
as thus he commund with his mighty heart

o heavn what marvel do mine eyes behold
my spear before me laid and vanishd he
at whom i hurld it with intent to slay
then is æneas of th immortal gods
in truth belovd though vain i deemd his boast
a curse go with him yet methinks not soon
will he again presume to prove my might
who gladly now in flight escapes from death
then to the valiant greeks my orders givn
let me some other trojans mettle prove
then towrd the ranks he sprang each sevral man
exhorting from the trojans valiant greeks
no longer stand aloof but man to man
confront the foe and nobly dare the fight
twere hard for me brave warrior though i be
to face such numbers and to fight with all
not mars nor pallas though immortal gods
could face and vanquish such a mighty mass
but what my single arm and feet and strength
may profit not a jot will i relax
right through the ranks i mean to force my way
and small shall be that trojans cause for joy
who comes within the compass of my spear

thus he exhorting hector cheering on
meanwhile the trojans with assurance givn
that he himself achilles would confront

ye valiant trojans fear not peleus son
i too in words could with the gods contend
though not in arms so much the stronger they
not all his words achilles shall make good
fulfilling some in others he shall fail
his course midway arrested him will i
encounter though his hands were hands of fire
of fire his hands his strength as burnishd steel

thus he exhorting with uplifted spears
advancd the trojans from the mingling hosts
loud rose the clamour then at hectors side
apollo stood and thus addressd the chief
hector forbear achilles to defy
and mid the crowd withdraw thee from the fray
lest with the spear he slay thee thrown from far
or with the sword in combat hand to hand

he said and troubled by the heavnly voice
hector amid the throng of men withdrew

then girt with might amid the trojans sprang
with fearful shouts achilles first he slew
otryntes son iphition valiant chief
of numrous warriors him a naiad nymph
in hydes fertile vale beneath the feet
of snowclad tmolus to otryntes bore
at him as on he rushd achilles hurld
and through his forehead drove his glittring spear
the head was cleft in twain thundring he fell
and oer him thus achilles made his boast

son of otryntes lie thou there of men
the most vainglorious here thou findst thy death
far from thy place of birth beside the lake
gygaean there hadst thou thine heritage
of old beside the fishabounding stream
of hyllus and by hermus eddying flood

thus he exulting oer iphitions eyes
were spread the shades of death his mangled corpse
was crushd beneath the grecian chariot wheels
in the first shock demoleon next he smote
a helpful aid in war antenors son
piercd thro the temples thro the brassbound helm
nor checkd the brazen helm the spear whose point
went crashing through the bone that all the brain
was shatterd onward as he rushd he fell
then through the neck hippodamas he smote
flying before him mounted on his car
deep groand he breathing out his soul as groans
a bull by sturdy youths to th altar draggd
of neptune king divine of helice
th earthshaking god well pleasd the gift receives
een with such groans his noble spirit fled
the godlike polydore he next assaild
the son of priam him his aged sire
would fain have kept at home of all his sons
at once the youngest and the bestbelovd
among them all for speed of foot unmatchd
whose youthful folly in the foremost ranks
his speed displaying cost him now his life
him as he darted by achilles spear
struck through the centre of the back where met
the golden clasps that held the glittring belt
and where the breastplate formd a double guard
right through his body passd the weapons point
groaning he fell upon his knees dark clouds
oerspread his eyes supporting with his hand
his wounded bowels on the ground he writhd
when hector saw his brother polydore
writhing in death a mist oerspread his eyes
nor longer could he bear to stand aloof
but sprang to meet achilles flashing fire
his keen spear brandishing at sight of him
up leapd achilles and exulting cried

lo here the man who most hath wrung my soul
who slew my lovd companion now methinks
upon the pass of war not long shall we
stand separate nor each the other shun

then with stern glance to godlike hector thus
draw near and quickly meet thy doom of death

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
unterrified achilles think not me
as though a fool and ignorant of war
to daunt with lofty speech i too could well
with cutting words and insult answer thee
i know thee strong and valiant and i know
myself to thee inferior but th event
is with the gods and i if such their will
the weaker with my spear may reach thy life
my point too hath ere now its sharpness provd

he said and poising hurld his pondrous spear
which from achilles pallas turnd aside
with lightest breath and back to hector sent
and laid before his feet intent to slay
onward achilles rushd with fearful shout
but phoebus hector from the field conveyd
 veild in thickest cloud
thrice peleus godlike son with brazen spear
his onset made thrice struck the misty cloud
but when with powr as of a god he made
his fourth essay in fury thus he cried

yet once again vile hound hast thou escapd
thy doom was nigh but thee thy god hath savd
phoebus to whom amid the clash of spears
well mayst thou pray we yet shall meet again
when i shall end thee if a guardian god
i too may claim meanwhile from thee i turn
and others seek on whom my hap may light

he said and drove through dryops neck his spear
and stretchd him at his feet and passd him by
next with his spear he struck below the knee
philetors son demuchus stout and tall
and checkd his forward course then rushing on
dealt with his mighty sword the mortal blow
the sons of bias next laogonus
and dardanus he hurld from off their car
one with the spear and one by swordstroke slain
tros too he slew alastors son who came
to meet him and embrace his knees and pray
to spare his life in pity of his youth
little he knew how vain would be his prayr
for not of temper soft nor mild of mood
was he but sternly fierce and as he knelt
and claspd his knees and would his prayr prefer
achilles clove him with his mighty sword
gashd through the liver as from out the wound
his liver droppd the dark blood gushing forth
his bosom filld and darkness closd his eyes
as ebbd his life away then through the ear
mulius he thrust at th other ear came forth
the brazen point echeclus next he met
son of agenor and his hilted sword
full on the centre of his head let fall
the hot blood dyd the blade the darkling shades
of death and rigrous fate his eyes oerspread
next where the tendons bind the elbowjoint
the brazen spear transfixd deucalions arm
with death in prospect and disabled arm
he stood till on his neck achilles sword
descending shard and flung afar both head
and helmet from the spines disseverd joints
the marrow flowd as stretchd in dust he lay
the noble son of peireus next he slew
rigmus who came from thracias fertile plains
him through the waist he struck the brazen spear
plungd in his bowels from the car he fell
and as areithous his charioteer
his horses turnd achilles through the neck
his sharp spear thrusting hurld him to the ground
the startled steeds in wild confusion thrown

as rage the fires amid the wooded glen
of some parchd mountains side and fiercely burns
the copsewood dry while eddying here and there
the flames are whirld before the gusty wind
so fierce achilles raged on evry side
pursuing slaughtring reekd the earth with blood
as when upon a wellrolld threshingfloor
two sturdyfronted steers together yokd
tread the white barley out beneath their feet
fast flies the grain outtrodden from the husk
so by achilles drivn his flying steeds
his chariot bore oer bodies of the slain
and broken bucklers trampling all beneath
was plashd with blood the axle and the rails
around the car as from the horses feet
and from the felloes of the wheels were thrown
the bloody gouts and onward still he pressd
panting for added triumphs deeply dyed
with gore and carnage his unconquerd hands





but when they came to eddying xanthus ford
fairflowing stream born of immortal jove
achilles cut in twain the flying host
part driving towrd the city oer the plain
where on the former day the routed greeks
when hector ragd victorious fled amain
on terrorstruck they rushd but juno spread
to baffle their retreat before their path
clouds and thick darkness half the fugitives
in the deep rivers silvry eddies plungd
with clamour loud they fell the torrent roard
the banks around reechoed here and there
they with the eddies wildly struggling swam
as when pursued by fire a hovring swarm
of locusts riverward direct their flight
and as th insatiate flames advance they cowr
amid the waters so a mingled mass
of men and horses by achilles drivn
the deeplywhirling stream of xanthus chokd
his spear amid the tamarisks on the bank
the hero left on savage deeds intent
armd with his sword alone a god in powr
he sprang amid the torrent right and left
he smote then fearful rose the groans of men
slain with the sword the stream ran red with blood
as fishes flying from a dolphin crowd
the shoal recesses of some open bay
in fear for whom he catches he devours
so crouchd the trojans in the mighty stream
beneath the banks and when at length his hand
wearied of slaughter from the stream alive
he draggd twelve youths whose forfeit lives should be
the bloody fine for slain patroclus paid
helpless from fear as fawns he brought them forth
their hands securd behind them with the belts
which oer their shirts of twisted mail they wore
and bade his comrades lead them to the ships
then on again he dashd athirst for blood
and first encounterd flying from the stream
lycaon priams son him once before
he by a nightly onslaught had surprisd
and from his fathers vineyard captive borne
where as he cut to form his chariot rail
a figtrees tender shoots unlookdfor ill
oertook him in the form of peleus son
thence in his ship to lemnos thriving isle
he bore him ransomd there by jasons son
his imbrian host eetion set him free
with libral gifts and to arisba sent
escaping thence he reachd his native home
twelve days save one rejoicing with his friends
he spent returnd from lemnos fate the twelfth
again consignd him to achilles hands
from him reluctant to receive his death
him when achilles swift of foot beheld
no spear in hand of helm and shield bereft
all flung in haste away as from the stream
reeking with sweat and faint with toil he fled
he commund wrathful with his mighty heart

ye gods what marvel do mine eyes behold
methinks the valiant trojans slain by me
ere long will from the realms of darkness rise
since death escaping but to slavry sold
in lemnos isle this fellow hath returnd
despite the hoary seas impediment
which many a man against his will hath stayd
now shall he taste my spear that i may see
if thence too he return or if the earth
may keep him safe which een the strongest holds

thus as he stood he musd but all aghast
approachd lycaon and would fain have claspd
the heros knees for longingly he sought
escape from bitter death and evil fate
achilles raisd his spear in act to strike
he stooping ran beneath and claspd his knees
above his back the murdrous weapon passd
and in the earth was fixd one suppliant hand
achilles knees embracd the other held
with unrelaxing grasp the pointed spear
as he with winged words imploring spoke

i clasp thy knees achilles look then down
with pity on my woes and recognize
illustrious chief a suppliants sacred claim
for in thy tent i first broke bread that day
when in my fathers fruitful vineyard seizd
thy captive i became to slavry sold
far from my sire and friends in lemnos isle
a hundred oxen were my ransom then
at thrice so much i now would buy my life
this day is but the twelfth since sorely tried
by lengthend suffering back to troy i came
now to thy hands once more my cruel fate
consigns me surely by the wrath of jove
pursued who gives me to thy powr again
me doomd to early death my mother bore
old altes daughter fair laothoe
altes who ruld the warlike leleges
in lofty pedasus by satnois stream
his child of priams many wives was one
two sons she bore and both by thee must die
already one the godlike polydore
amid the foremost ranks thy spear hath slain
and now my doom hath found me for from thee
since evil fate hath placd me in thy hands
i may not hope to fly yet hear but this
and weigh it in thy mind to spare my life
i come not of that womb which hector bore
who slew thy comrade gentle kind and brave

thus priams noble son imploring spoke
but stern the answer fell upon his ear

thou fool no more to me of ransom prate
before patroclus met the doom of death
to spare the trojans still my soul inclind
and many captives taen alive i sold
but from henceforth before the walls of troy
not one of all the trojans whom the gods
may to my hands deliver least of all
a son of priam shall escape the death
thou too my friend must die why vainly wail
dead is patroclus too thy better far
me too thou seest how stalwart tall and fair
of noble sire and goddessmother born
yet must i yield to death and stubborn fate
wheneer at morn or noon or eve the spear
or arrow from the bow may reach my life

he said and sank lycaons limbs and heart
he loosd the spear and sat with both his hands
upraisd imploring but achilles drew
and on his neck beside the collarbone
let fall his trenchant sword the twoedgd blade
was buried deep prone on the earth he lay
forth gushd the crimson blood and dyed the ground

him dragging by the feet achilles threw
in the mid stream and thus with vaunting speech

lie there amid the fishes who shall cleanse
but not with kindly thought thy gory wounds
oer thee extended on thy bier shall rise
no mothers wail scamanders eddying stream
shall to the seas broad bosom roll thee down
and springing through the darkly rippling wave
fishes shall rise and banquet on thy flesh
on now the work of death till flying ye
and slaughtring i we reach the city wall
nor this fairflowing silvereddying stream
shall aught avail ye though to him ye pay
in sacrifice the blood of countless bulls
and living horses in his waters sink
ye all shall perish till patroclus death
be fully avengd and slaughter of the greeks
whom in my absence by the ships ye slew
he said the mighty river at his words
indignant chafd and ponderd in his mind
how best to check achilles warlike toil
and from destruction guard the trojan host

meantime achilles with his pondrous spear
asteropaeus son of pelegon
assaild with deadly purpose pelegon
to broadlyflowing axius owd his birth
the rivergod commingling with the blood
of periboea daughter eldest born
of acessamenus on him he sprang
he from the river rising stood opposd
two lances in his hand his courage rousd
by xanthus who indignant saw his stream
polluted by the blood of slaughterd youths
by fierce achilles hand unpitying slain
when near the warriors each to other came
achilles swift of foot took up the word
what man and whence art thou who darst to stand
opposd to me of most unhappy sires
the children they who my encounter meet

to whom th illustrious son of pelegon
great son of peleus why enquire my race
from far paeonias fertile fields i come
the leader of the longspeard paeon host
ten days have passd since i to ilium came
from widelyflowing axius my descent
axius the purest stream on earth that flows
he pelegon begot the spearrenownd
of pelegon i boast me sprung and now
address thee brave achilles to the fight

threatning he spoke achilles raisd on high
the pelian spear but ambidexter he
from either hand at once a javlin launchd
one struck but piercd not through the mighty shield
stayd by the golden plate the gift of heavn
achilles right forearm the other grazd
forth gushd the crimson blood but glancing by
and vainly longing for the taste of flesh
the point behind him in the earth was fixd
then at asteropaeus in his turn
with deadly intent the son of peleus threw
his straightdirected spear his mark he missd
but struck the lofty bank where deep infixd
to half its length the pelian ash remaind
then from beside his thigh achilles drew
his trenchant blade and furious onward rushd
while from the cliff asteropaeus strove
in vain with stalwart hand to wrench the spear
three times he shook it with impetuous force
three times relaxd his grasp a fourth attempt
he made to bend and break the sturdy shaft
but him preventing peleus godlike son
with deadly stroke across the belly smote
and gushd his bowels forth upon the ground
gasping he lay and darkness seald his eyes
then on his breast achilles sprang and strippd
his armour off and thus with vaunting speech
so lie thou there tis hard for thee to fight
though riverborn against the progeny
of mighty jove a widelyflowing stream
thou claimst as author of thy parentage
my high descent from jove himself i boast
my father peleus son of æacus
reigns oer the numrous race of myrmidons
the son of jove himself was æacus
high oer all rivers that to th ocean flow
is jove exalted and in like degree
superior is his race in powr to theirs
a mighty river hast thou here at hand
if that might aught avail thee but his powr
is impotent to strive with saturns son
with him not achelous king of streams
presumes to vie nor een the mighty strength
of deeplyflowing wide oceanus
from whom all rivers all the boundless sea
all fountains all deep wells derive their source
yet him appals the lightning bolt of jove
and thunder pealing from the vault of heavn
he said and from the cliff withdrew his spear
him left he lifeless there upon the sand
extended oer him the dark waters washd
and eels and fishes thronging gnawd his flesh
then mid the paeons plumed host he rushd
who fled along the eddying stream when him
their bravest in the stubborn fight they saw
slain by the sword and arm of peleus son
thersilochus and mydon then he slew
mnesus and thrasius and astypylus
ænius and ophelestes and yet more
had been the slaughter by achilles wrought
but from his eddying depths in human form
with wrathful tone the mighty river spoke

in strength achilles and in deeds of arms
all mortals thou surpassest for the gods
themselves attend thee and protect from harm
if saturns son have given thee utterly
the trojans to destroy yet ere thou slay
far from my waters drive them oer the plain
for now my lovely stream is filld with dead
nor can i pour my current to the sea
with floating corpses chokd whilst thou pursuest
the work of death insatiate stay thy hand
with horror i behold thee mighty chief

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
be it as thou wilt scamander heavnborn stream
yet cease i not to slay until i drive
these vaunting trojans to their walls and prove
the force of hector if in single fight
i be by him or he by me subdued

he said and fiercely on the trojans rushd
a god in might to phoebus then his speech
the deeplyeddying river thus addressd

god of the silver bow great son of jove
obeyst thou thus the will of saturns son
who chargd thee by the trojans still to stand
and aid their cause till evnings late approach
should cast its shadows oer the fertile earth

thus as he spoke from off the lofty bank
achilles springing in mid current plungd
then high the swelling stream tumultuous rose
in all its angry flood and with a roar
as of a bellowing bull cast forth to land
the numrous corpses by achilles slain
and many living in his cavernd bed
conceald behind the whirling waters savd
fierce round achilles rose the boiling wave
and on his shield descending drove him down
nor might he keep his foothold but he graspd
a lofty elm wellgrown which from the cliff
uprooted all the bank had torn away
and with its tangled branches checkd the flow
of the fair river which with all its length
it bridgd across then springing from the deep
swiftly he fled in terror oer the plain
nor ceasd the mighty river but pursued
with darklyruffling crest intent to stay
achilles course and save the trojan host
far as a javlins flight he rushd in speed
like the dark hunter eagle strongest deemd
and swiftest wingd of all the featherd race
so on he sped loud rattled on his breast
his brazen armour as before the god
cowring he fled the god behind him still
with thundring sound pursued as when a man
from some darkwaterd spring through trenches leads
mid plants and gardens th irrigating stream
and spade in hand th appointed channel clears
down flows the stream anon its pebbly bed
disturbing fast it flows with bubbling sound
down the steep slope oertaking him who leads
achilles so th advancing wave oertook
though great his speed but man must yield to gods
oft as achilles swift of foot essayd
to turn and stand and know if all the gods
who dwell in heavn were leagued to daunt his soul
so oft the heavnborn rivers mighty wave
above his shoulders dashd in deep distress
he sprang on high then rushd the flood below
and bore him off his legs and wore away
the soil beneath his feet then groaning thus
as up to heavn he lookd achilles cried
o father jove will none of all the gods
in pity save me from this angry flood
content thereafter would i meet my fate
of all the powrs of heavn my mother most
hath wrongd me who hath buoyd me up with hope
delusive that before the walls of troy
i should by phoebus swiftwingd arrows fall
would that by hectors hand twere mine to die
the bravest of their brave a warrior so
were by a warrior slain now am i doomd
ignobly here to sink the mighty flood
oerwhelming me like some poor shepherd lad
borne down in crossing by a wintry brook

he said and quickly clothd in mortal form
neptune and pallas at his side appeard
with cheering words they took him by the hand
and thus th earthshaking god his speech began

achilles fear not thou nor be dismayd
such powrful aid by joves consent we bring
pallas and i from heavn tis not decreed
that thou shouldst by the river be oerwhelmd
he shall retire ere long and thou shalt see
and more if thou wilt hear we undertake
that from the war thine arm shall not be stayd
till thou shalt drive beneath the walls of troy
the crowd of flying trojans thou thyself
shalt hector slay and safe regain the ships
such high renown we give thee to achieve

they to the other gods this said returnd
he greatly strengthend by the voice divine
pressd onwards to the plain the plain he found
all flooded oer and floating armour fair
and many a corpse of men in battle slain
yet onward lifting high his feet he pressd
right towrd the stream nor could the mighty stream
check his advance such vigour pallas gave
nor did scamander yet his fury stay
but fiercer rose his rage and rearing high
his crested wave to simois thus he cried

dear brother aid me with united force
this mortals course to check he unrestraind
will royal priams city soon destroy
nor will the trojans his assault endure
haste to the rescue then and from their source
fill all thy stream and all thy channels swell
rouse thy big waves and roll a torrent down
of logs and stones to whelm this man of might
who triumphs now and bears him as a god
nought shall his strength or beauty then avail
or gallant arms beneath the waters sunk
deep buried in the mud himself will i
in sand imbed and oer his corpse a pile
of shingly gravel heap nor shall the greeks
be able to collect his bones encasd
by me so deep in slime his monument
they here may raise but when they celebrate
his funral rites no mound will he require

he said and on achilles from on high
came boiling rushing down with thundring roar
with foam and blood and corpses intermixd
high rose the heavnborn rivers darkling wave
and bore achilles downward then in fear
lest the broad waters of the eddying stream
should quite oerwhelm him juno cried aloud
and vulcan thus her son in haste addressd

up vulcan up my son for we had deemd
that eddying xanthus stood to thee opposd
haste thee to aid thy fiery strength display
while from the sea i call the stormy blast
of zephyr and brisk notus who shall drive
the raging flames ahead and burn alike
the trojans and their arms do thou the while
burn down the trees on xanthus banks himself
assail with fire nor by his honeyd words
nor by his menaces be turnd aside
nor till thou hear my voice restrain thy powr
then stay the raging flames unwearied course

thus juno spoke and vulcan straight prepard
the heavnly fire and first upon the plain
the flames he kindled and the dead consumd
who lay promiscuous by achilles slain
the plain was dried and stayd the watry flood
as when the breath of boreas quickly dries
in autumntime a newlywaterd field
the tillers heart rejoicing so was dried
the spacious plain then he the dead consumd
against the river turnd the fiery glare
burnt were the willows elms and tamarisk shrubs
the lotus and the reeds and galingal
which by the lovely river grew profuse
the eels and fishes mid the eddying whirl
mid the clear wave were hurrying here and there
in dire distress from vulcans fiery breath
scorchd by the flames the mighty river spoke

vulcan no god against thy powr can stand
nor with thy fiery flames will i contend
restrain thy wrath though peleus godlike son
should from their city drive the trojans straight
with rival parties what concern have i

all scorchd he spoke his fair stream bubbling up
as when a caldron on a blazing fire
filld with the melting fat of wellfed swine
boils up within and bubbles all around
with welldried wood beneath so bubbling up
the waters of the lovely river boild
nor onward would he flow but checkd his course
by the hot blast oerborne and fiery strength
of skilful vulcan and to juno thus
imploring he his winged words addressd

juno what cause impels thy son my stream
oer all the rest to visit with his wrath
een less than others who the trojans aid
have i offended yet at thy command
will i withdraw but bid that he too cease
and this i swear no trojan more to save
though to devouring flames a prey all troy
were blazing kindled by the valiant greeks

this when the whitearmd goddess juno heard
to vulcan straight she thus addressd her speech
vulcan my glorious son restrain thy hand
in mortal mens behalf it is not meet
to press thus hardly an immortal god

she said and vulcan stayd his fiery strength
and back returning in his wonted bed
flowd the fair river xanthus thus subdued
these two their warfare ceasd by juno checkd
despite her wrath but mid the other gods
arose contention fierce and discord dire
their warring passions rousd on either side
with fearful crash they met the broad earth groand
loud rang the heavn as with a trumpets sound
jove on olympus height the tumult heard
and in his heart he laughd a joyous laugh
to see the gods in angry battle met
not long they stood aloof led on by mars
the bucklerbreaker who to pallas first
poising his spear his bitter speech addressd

what dost thou here thou saucy jade to war
the gods exciting overbold of mood
led by thy haughty spirit dost thou forget
how thou the son of tydeus diomed
didst urge against me and with visible spear
direct his aim and aid to wound my flesh
for all i sufferd then thou now shalt pay

thus as he spoke he struck the tasselld shield
awful to view which not the lightning bolt
of jove himself could pierce the bloodstaind mars
against it thrust in vain his pondrous spear
the goddess stoopd and in her ample hand
took up a stone that lay upon the plain
dark rugged vast which men of elder days
had set to mark the limits of their land
full on the neck of mars she hurld the mass
his limbs relaxing oer sevn hundred feet
prostrate he lay his hair defild with dust
loud rang his armour and with scornful smile
pallas addressd him thus with vaunting speech

fool hast thou yet to learn how mightier far
my strength than thine that me thou darst to meet
bear thus the burthen of thy mothers curse
who works thee harm in wrath that thou the greeks
deserting aidst the haughty trojans cause

she said and turnd away her piercing glance
him deeply groaning scarce to life restord
joves daughter venus taking by the hand
led from the field which when the whitearmd queen
beheld in haste to pallas thus she cried
o heavn brave child of aegisbearing jove
undaunted lo again this saucy jade
amid the press the bane of mortals mars
leads from the field but haste thee in pursuit

thus juno pallas hastend in pursuit
well pleasd and venus with her powrful hand
assailing struck upon the breast at once
the goddess courage and her limbs gave way
there on the ground the two together lay
while pallas oer them thus with vaunting speech

would all were such who aid the trojan cause
wheneer they meet in fight the warlike greeks
as valiant and as stout as venus proves
who brings her aid to mars confronting me
then had our warlike labours long been oer
and iliums strongbuilt citadel overthrown

thus pallas spoke the whitearmd goddess smild
and to apollo thus th earthshaker spoke

phoebus why stand we idly thus aloof
the war begun by others tis not meet
and shame it were that to olympus height
and to the brazenfloord abode of jove
we two without a contest should return
thou then begin as younger twere not well
for me in age and practice more advancd
feeble of soul how senseless is thy heart
hast thou forgotten all the cruel wrongs
we two alone of all th immortals bore
when here in ilium for a year we servd
by joves command the proud laomedon
for promisd hire and he our tasks assignd
his fortress and a wall both broad and fair
i built the towns impregnable defence
while thou didst on his plodding herds attend
in manycrested idas woody glens
but when the joyous seasons in their course
had brought our labours term the haughty king
denied our guerdon and with threats dismissd
bound hand and foot he threatend thee to send
and sell to slavry in the distant isles
and with the sword cut off the ears of both
so in indignant sorrow we returnd
robbd of the hire he promisd but denied
for this thy favour dost thou show to troy
and dost not rather join thy force to ours
that down upon their knees the trojans all
should perish with their babes and matrons chaste

whom answerd thus the fardestroying king
earthshaking god i should not gain with thee
the esteem of wise if i with thee should fight
for mortal men poor wretches who like leaves
flourish awhile and eat the fruits of earth
but sapless soon decay from combat then
refrain we and to others leave the strife

he turnd thus saying for he deemd it shame
his fathers brother to assail in arms
but him his sister goddess of the chase
rebukd and thus with scornful speech addressd

fliest thou apollo and to neptune leavst
the easy victory and baseless fame
why oer thy shoulder hangs thine idle bow
neer in our fathers halls again as erst
among th immortals let me hear thee boast
how thou with neptune wouldst in arms contend

thus she apollo answerd not a word
but joves imperial consort filld with wrath
assaild with bitter words the archerqueen

how canst thou dare thou saucy minx to stand
opposd to me too great for thine assault
despite thy bow though jove hath givn thee powr
oer feeble women whom thou wilt to slay
een as a lion better weret for thee
to chase the mountain beasts and flying hinds
than thy superiors thus to meet in arms
but since thou darst confront me thou shalt know
and feel how far my might surpasses thine

she said and with the left hand both the wrists
of dian grasping with her ample right
the bow and quiver from her shoulders tore
and with them as she turnd away her head
with scornful laughter buffeted her ears
the arrows keen were scatterd on the ground
weeping the goddess fled as flies a dove
the hawks pursuit and in a hollow rock
finds refuge doomd not yet to fall a prey
so weeping dian fled and left her bow

them hermes to latona thus with thee
i strive not shame it were to meet in fight
a consort of the cloudcompelling jove
freely amid th immortals make thy boast
that by thy prowess thou hast vanquishd me

thus he latona gatherd up the bow
and fallen arrows scatterd here and there
amid the whirling dust then these regaind
following her daughter from the field withdrew
meanwhile to high olympus fled the maid
and to the brazenfloord abode of jove
there weeping on her fathers knees she sat
while quiverd round her form th ambrosial robe
the son of saturn towrds him drew his child
and thus with gracious smile enquiry made
which of the heavnly powrs hath wrongd thee thus
my child as guilty of some open shame

to whom the brightcrownd goddess of the chase
thy wife my father whitearmd juno she
hath dealt thus rudely with me she from whom
all jars and strife among the gods proceed

such converse while they held the gates of troy
apollo enterd for the wellbuilt wall
alarmd lest een against the will of fate
the greeks that day should raze it to the ground
the other gods were to olympus gone
triumphant these and those in angry mood
and took their seats before the cloudgirt sire
but on the trojans pressing peleus son
horses and men alike promiscuous slew
as in a city which the gods in wrath
have fird whose volleying smoke ascends to heavn
on all her people grievous toil is cast
on many harm and loss such toil such loss
achilles wrought amid the trojan host

upon a lofty towr the work of gods
the aged priam stood and thence beheld
by fierce achilles driven in flight confused
their courage quite subdued the trojan host
then groaning from the towr he hastend down
and to the warders cried along the wall

stand to the gates and hold them opend wide
that in the crowd of fugitives may pour
and refuge find for close upon their flight
achilles hangs disaster now is near
but while our friends receivd within the walls
find time to breathe again replace in haste
the closelyfitting portals for i fear
that man of blood may een the city storm

he said the gates they opend and drew back
the solid bars the portals opning wide
let in the light but in the vacant space
apollo stood the trojan host to save
the flyers parchd with thirst and dustbegrimd
straight for the city and the lofty wall
made from the plain achilles spear in hand
pressd hotly on the rearmost for his soul
with rage was filld and maddning lust of fame
and now the loftygated city of troy
the sons of greece had won but phoebus rousd
agenors spirit a valiant youth and strong
son of antenor he his bosom filld
with dauntless courage and beside him stood
to turn aside the heavy hand of death
as veild in cloud against the oak he leand
he when achilles awful form he knew
yet firmly stood though much perplexd in mind
as thus he commund with his mighty heart

oh woe is me should i attempt to fly
before achilles might where fly the rest
across the plain disorderd he would soon
oertake me and in flight ignoble slay
or should i leave the others to their fate
scatterd by peleus son and from the wall
and oer the plain of troy direct my flight
far as the foot of idas hill and there
lie hid in thickest covert and at eve
refreshd by bathing in the cooling stream
and purgd the sweat retrace my steps to troy
yet why my soul admit such thoughts as these
for should he mark me flying from the town
and overtake me by his speed of foot
no hope were left me of escape from death
so far his strength exceeds the strength of man
but how if boldly i await him here
before the wall his flesh is not to wounds
impervious but a single life is his
nor is he more they say than mortal man
though jove assists him and his triumph wills

he said and stood collected to await
achilles onset and his manly heart
with courage filld was eager for the fray
as when a panther from the thickets depth
comes forth to meet the hunter undismayd
nor turnd to flight by baying of the hounds
nor wounded or by javlin or by sword
or by the spear transfixd remits her rage
but fights until she reach her foe or die
agenor so antenors godlike son
disdaind to fly ere prove achilles might
before his breast his shields broad orb he bore
and poisd his spear as thus he calld aloud

thy hope renownd achilles was this day
the valiant trojans city to destroy
unconscious of the toils the woes that ye
around her walls await ye for within
are warriors brave and numrous who will fight
in her defence for parents children wives
thou too achilles here shalt meet thy doom
allpowrful as thou art and warrior bold

he said and threw with stalwart hand the spear
achilles leg he struck below the knee
nor missd his aim and loudly rang the greaves
of newwrought tin but back the brazen point
rebounded nor the heavnly armour piercd
in turn achilles on agenor sprang
but phoebus robbd him of his hopdfor prize
who veild in thickest cloud conveyd away
antenors son and from the battle bore
to rest in peace while he by guile withdrew
the son of peleus from the flying crowd
for in agenors very likeness clad
before him stood the fardestroying king
then fled achilles hastning in pursuit
he oer the fertile plain with flying foot
pursud beside scamanders eddying stream
apollo turnd and still but little space
before him flying subtly lurd him on
each moment hoping to attain his prize
meantime the genral crowd in panic flight
with eager haste the citys refuge sought
and all the town with fugitives was filld
nor did they dare without the walls to stand
for mutual aid nor halt to know what friends
were safe who left upon the battlefield
but through the gates pourd in the hurrying mass
who to their active limbs their safety owd





thus they from panic flight like timorous fawns
within the walls escaping dried their sweat
and drank and quenchd their thirst reclining safe
on the fair battlements but nearer drew
with slanted shields the greeks yet hector still
in front of ilium and the scaean gate
stayd by his evil doom remaind without
then phoebus thus to peleus godlike son
achilles why with active feet pursue
thou mortal me immortal knowst thou not
my godhead that so hot thy fury burns
or heedst thou not that all the trojan host
whom thou hast scard while thou art here withdrawn
within the walls a refuge safe have found
on me thy sword is vain i know not death

enragd achilles swift of foot replied
deep is the injury fardarting king
most hostile of the gods that at thy hand
i bear who here hast lurd me from the walls
which many a trojan else had faild to reach
ere by my hand they bit the bloody dust
me of immortal honour thou hast robbd
and them thyself from vengeance safe hast savd
had i the powr that vengeance thou shouldst feel

thus saying and on mightiest deeds intent
he turnd him cityward with fiery speed
as when a horse contending for the prize
whirls the swift car and stretches oer the plain
een so with active limbs achilles racd

him first the aged priams eyes discernd
scouring the plain in arms all dazzling bright
like to th autumnal star whose brilliant ray
shines eminent amid the depth of night
whom men the dogstar of orion call
the brightest he but sign to mortal man
of evil augury and fiery heat
so shone the brass upon the warriors breast

the old man groand aloud and lifting high
his hands he beat his head and with loud voice
calld on his son imploring he unmovd
held post before the gates awaiting there
achilles fierce encounter him his sire
with hands outstretchd and piteous tone addressd

hector my son await not here alone
that warriors charge lest thou to fate succumb
beneath pelides arm thy better far
accursd be he would that th immortal gods
so favourd him as i then should his corpse
soon to the vultures and the dogs be givn

by whom i am of many sons bereavd
many and brave whom he has slain or sold
to distant isles in slavry and een now
within the city walls i look in vain
for two lycaon brave and polydore
my gallant sons by fair laothoe
if haply yet they live with brass and gold
their ransom shall be paid good store of these
we can command for with his daughter fair
a wealthy dowry aged altes gave
but to the viewless shades should they have gone
deep were their mothers sorrow and my own
but of the genral public well i know
far lighter were the grief than if they heard
that thou hadst falln beneath achilles hand
then enter now my son the city gates
and of the women and the men of troy
be still the guardian nor to peleus son
with thine own life immortal glory give
look too on me with pity me on whom
een on the threshold of mine age hath jove
a bitter burthen cast condemnd to see
my sons struck down my daughters draggd away
in servile bonds our chambers sanctity
invaded and our babes by hostile hands
dashd to the ground and by ferocious greeks
enslavd the widows of my slaughterd sons
on me at last the ravning dogs shall feed
when by some foemans hand by sword or lance
my soul shall from my body be divorcd
those very dogs which i myself have bred
fed at my table guardians of my gate
shall lap my blood and overgorgd shall lie
een on my threshold that a youth should fall
victim to mars beneath a foemans spear
may well beseem his years and if he fall
with honour though he die yet glorious he
but when the hoary head and hoary beard
and naked corpse to ravning dogs are givn
no sadder sight can wretched mortals see

the old man spoke and from his head he tore
the hoary hair yet hector firm remaind
then to the front his mother rushd in tears
her bosom bare with either hand her breast
sustaining and with tears addressd him thus
hector my child thy mothers breast revere
and on this bosom if thine infant woes
have eer been hushd bear now in mind dear child
the debt thou owst and from within the walls
ward off this fearful man nor in the field
encounter cursd be he should he prevail
and slay thee not upon the funral bed
my child my own the offspring of my womb
shall i deplore thee nor thy widowd wife
but far away beside the grecian ships
thy corpse shall to the ravning dogs be givn

thus they with tears and earnest prayrs imploring
addressd their son yet hector firm remaind
waiting th approach of peleus godlike son
as when a snake upon the mountain side
with deadly venom chargd beside his hole
awaits the traveller and filld with rage
coild round his hole his baleful glances darts
so filld with dauntless courage hector stood
scorning retreat his gleaming buckler proppd
against the jutting towr then deeply movd
thus with his warlike soul communion held

oh woe is me if i should enter now
the city gates i should the just reproach
encounter of polydamas who first
his counsel gave within the walls to lead
the trojan forces on that fatal night
when great achilles in the field appeard
i heeded not his counsel would i had
now since my folly hath the people slain
i well might blush to meet the trojan men
and longrobd dames of troy lest some might say
to me inferior far this woful loss
to hectors blind selfconfidence we owe
thus shall they say for me twere better far
or from achilles slain in open fight
back to return in triumph or myself
to perish nobly in my countrys cause
what if my bossy shield i lay aside
and stubborn helmet and my pondrous spear
propping against the wall go forth to meet
th unmatchd achilles what if i engage
that helens self and with her all the spoil
and all that paris in his hollow ships
brought here to troy whence first this war arose
should be restord and to the greeks be paid
an ample tribute from the citys stores
her secret treasures and hereafter bind
the trojans by their elders solemn oaths
nought to withhold but fairly to divide
whateer of wealth our muchloved city holds
but wherefore entertain such thoughts my soul
should i so meet him what if he should show
nor pity nor remorse but slay me there
defenceless as a woman and unarmd
not this the time nor he the man with whom
by forest oak or rock like youth and maid
to hold light talk as youth and maid might hold
better to dare the fight and know at once
to whom the victry is decreed by heavn

thus as he stood he musd but near approachd
achilles terrible as plumed mars
from his right shoulder brandishing aloft
the ashen spear of peleus while around
flashd his bright armour dazzling as the glare
of burning fire or of the rising sun
hector beheld and trembled at the sight
nor dard he there await th attack but left
the gates behind and terrorstricken fled
forward with flying foot pelides rushd
as when a falcon bird of swiftest flight
from some high mountaintop on timrous dove
swoops fiercely down she from beneath in fear
evades the stroke he dashing through the brake
shrillshrieking pounces on his destind prey
so wingd with desprate hate achilles flew
so hector flying from his keen pursuit
beneath the walls his active sinews plied
they by the watchtowr and beneath the wall
where stood the windbeat figtree racd amain
along the public road until they reachd
the fairlyflowing fount whence issud forth
from double source scamanders eddying streams
one with hot current flows and from beneath
as from a furnace clouds of steam arise
mid summers heat the other rises cold
as hail or snow or water crystallizd
beside the fountains stood the washingtroughs
of wellwrought stone where erst the wives of troy
and daughters fair their choicest garments washd
in peaceful times ere came the sons of greece
there racd they one in flight and one pursuing
good he who fled but better who pursud
with fiery speed for on that race was stakd
no common victim no ignoble ox
the prize at stake was mighty hectors life
as when the solidfooted horses fly
around the course contending for the prize
tripod or woman of her lord bereft
so racd they thrice around the walls of troy
with active feet and all the gods beheld
then thus began the sire of gods and men
a woful sight mine eyes behold a man
i love in flight around the walls my heart
for hector grieves who now upon the crown
of deeplyfurrowd ida now again
on iliums heights with fat of choicest bulls
hath pild mine altar whom around the walls
with flying speed achilles now pursues
give me your counsel gods and say from death
if we shall rescue him or must he die
brave as he is beneath pelides hand

to whom the blueeyd goddess pallas thus
o father lightningflashing cloudgirt king
what words are these wouldst thou a mortal man
long doomd by fate again from death preserve
do as thou wilt but not with our consent

to whom the cloudcompeller thus replied
be of good cheer my child unwillingly
i speak yet both thy wishes to oppose
have then thy will and draw not back thy hand

his words fresh impulse gave to pallas zeal
and from olympus heights in haste she sped

meanwhile on hector with untiring hate
the swift achilles pressd as when a hound
through glen and tangled brake pursues a fawn
rousd from its lair upon the mountain side
and if awhile it should evade pursuit
low crouching in the copse yet quests he back
searching unwearied till he find the trace
so hector sought to baffle but in vain
the keen pursuit of peleus active son
oft as he sought the shelter of the gates
beneath the wellbuilt towrs if haply thence
his comrades weapons might some aid afford
so oft his foeman with superior speed
would cut him off and turn him to the plain
he towrd the city still essayd his flight
and as in dreams when one pursues in vain
one seeks in vain to fly the other seeks
as vainly to pursue so could not now
achilles reach nor hector quit his foe
yet how should hector now the doom of death
have scapd had not apollo once again
and for the last time to his rescue come
and givn him strength and suppleness of limb

then to the crowd achilles with his head
made sign that none at hector should presume
to cast a spear lest one might wound and so
the greater glory obtain while he himself
must be contented with the second place
but when the fourth time in their rapid course
the founts were reachd th eternal father hung
his golden scales aloft and placd in each
the lots of doom for great achilles one
for hector one and held them by the midst
down sank the scale weighted with hectors death
down to the shades and phoebus left his side

then to pelides came the blueeyd maid
and stood beside him and bespoke him thus
achilles lovd of heavn i trust that now
to thee and me great glory shall accrue
in hectors fall insatiate of the fight
escape he cannot now though at the feet
of aegisbearing jove on his behalf
with earnest prayr apollo prostrate fall
but stay thou here and take thy breath while i
persuade him to return and dare the fight

so pallas spoke and he with joy obeying
stood leaning on his brassbarbd ashen spear
the goddess left him there and went 
in search of godlike hector him she found
and standing near with winged words addressd

sorely good brother hast thou been bested
by fierce achilles who around the walls
hath chasd thee with swift foot now stand we both
for mutual succour and his onset wait

to whom great hector of the glancing helm
deiphobus of all my brothers sons
of hecuba and priam thou hast been
still dearest to my heart and now the more
i honour thee who darst on my behalf
seeing my peril from within the walls
to sally forth while others skulk behind

to whom the blueeyd goddess thus replied
with many prayrs good brother both our sire
and honourd mother and our comrades all
successively implored me to remain
such fear is falln on all but in my soul
on thine account too deep a grief i felt
now forward boldly spare we not our spears
make trial if achilles to the ships
from both of us our bloody spoils can bear
or by thine arm himself may be subdued

thus pallas lurd him on with treachrous wile
but when the two were met and close at hand
first spoke great hector of the glancing helm

no more before thee peleus son i fly
thrice have i fled around the walls nor dard
await thine onset now my spirit is rousd
to stand before thee to be slain or slay
but let us first th immortal gods invoke
the surest witnesses and guardians they
of compacts at my hand no foul disgrace
shalt thou sustain if jove with victory
shall crown my firm endurance and thy life
to me be forfeit of thine armour strippd
i promise thee achilles to the greeks
thy body to restore do thou the like

with fierce regard achilles answerd thus
hector thou object of my deadly hate
talk not to me of compacts as tween men
and lions no firm concord can exist
nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite
but ceaseless enmity between them dwells
so not in friendly terms nor compact firm
can thou and i unite till one of us
glut with his blood the mailclad warrior mars
mind thee of all thy fence behoves thee now
to prove a spearman skilld and warrior brave
for thee escape is none now by my spear
hath pallas doomd thy death my comrades blood
which thou hast shed shall all be now avengd

he said and poising hurld his weighty spear
but hector saw and shunnd the blow he stoopd
and oer his shoulder flew the brasstippd spear
and in the ground was fixd but pallas drew
the weapon forth and to achilles hand
all unobservd of hector gave it back
then hector thus to peleus matchless son

thine aim has faild nor truly has my fate
thou godlike son of peleus been to thee
from heavn reveald such was indeed thy boast
but flippant was thy speech and subtly framd
to scare me with big words and make me prove
false to my wonted prowess and renown
not in my back will i receive thy spear
but through my breast confronting thee if jove
have to thine arm indeed such triumph givn
now if thou canst my spear in turn elude
may it be deeply buried in thy flesh
for lighter were to troy the load of war
if thou the greatest of her foes wert slain

he said and poising hurld his pondrous spear
nor missd his aim full in the midst he struck
pelides shield but glancing from the shield
the weapon bounded off hector was grievd
that thus his spear had bootless left his hand
he stood aghast no second spear was nigh
and loudly on deiphobus he calld
a spear to bring but he was far away
then hector knew that he was dupd and cried
oh heavn the gods above have doomd my death
i deemd indeed that brave deiphobus
was near at hand but he within the walls
is safe and i by pallas am betrayd
now is my death at hand nor far away
escape is none since so hath jove decreed
and joves fardarting son who heretofore
have been my guards my fate hath found me now
yet not without a struggle let me die
nor all inglorious but let some great act
which future days may hear of mark my fall

thus as he spoke his sharpedged sword he drew
pondrous and vast suspended at his side
collected for the spring and forward dashd
as when an eagle bird of loftiest flight
through the dark clouds swoops downward on the plain
to seize some tender lamb or cowring hare
so hector rushd and wavd his sharpedgd sword
achilles wrath was rousd with fury wild
his soul was filld before his breast he bore
his wellwrought shield and fiercely on his brow
nodded the fourplumd helm as on the breeze
floated the golden hairs with which the crest
by vulcans hand was thickly interlacd
and as amid the stars unnumberd host
when twilight yields to night one star appears
hesper the brightest star that shines in heavn
gleamd the sharppointed lance which in his right
achilles poisd on godlike hectors doom
intent and scanning eagerly to see
where from attack his body least was fencd
all else the glittring armour guarded well
which hector from patroclus corpse had strippd
one chink appeard just where the collarbone
the neck and shoulder parts beside the throat
where lies exposd the swiftest road of death
there levelld he as hector onward rushd
right through the yielding neck the lance was drivn
but severd not the windpipe nor destroyd
his powr of speech prone in the dust he fell
and oer him vaunting thus achilles spoke

hector patroclus stripping of his arms
thy hope was that thyself wast safe and i
not present brought no terror to thy soul
fool in the hollow ships i yet remaind
i his avenger mightier far than he
i who am now thy conquror by the dogs
and vultures shall thy corpse be foully torn
while him the greeks with funral rites shall grace

whom answerd hector of the glancing helm
prostrate and helpless by thy soul thy knees
thy parents heads achilles i beseech
let not my corpse by grecian dogs be torn
accept the ample stores of brass and gold
which as my ransom by my honourd sire
and mother shall be paid thee but my corpse
restore that so the men and wives of troy
may deck with honours due my funral pyre

to whom with fierce aspect achilles thus
knee me no knees vile hound nor prate to me
of parents such my hatred that almost
i could persuade myself to tear and eat
thy mangled flesh such wrongs i have to avenge
he lives not who can save thee from the dogs
not though with ransom ten and twenty fold
he here should stand and yet should promise more
no not though priams royal self should sue
to be allowd for gold to ransom thee
no not een so thy mother shall obtain
to lay thee out upon the couch and mourn
oer thee her offspring but on all thy limbs
shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast

to whom thus hector of the glancing helm
dying i know thee well nor did i hope
to change thy purpose iron is thy soul
but see that on thy head i bring not down
the wrath of heavn when by the scaean gate
the hand of paris with apollos aid
brave warrior as thou art shall strike thee down

een as he spoke his eyes were closd in death
and to the viewless shades his spirit fled
mourning his fate his youth and vigour lost

to him though dead achilles thus replied
die thou my fate i then shall meet wheneer
jove and th immortal gods shall so decree

he said and from the corpse his spear withdrew
and laid aside then strippd the armour off
with blood besmeard the greeks around him throngd
gazing on hectors noble form and face
and none approachd that did not add a wound
and one to other lookd and said good faith
hector is easier far to handle now
then when erewhile he wrappd our ships in fire
thus would they say then stab the dead anew

but when the son of peleus swift of foot
had strippd the armour from the corpse he rose
and standing thus th assembled greeks addressd
o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
since heavn hath granted us this man to slay
whose single arm hath wrought us more of ill
than all the rest combind advance we now
before the city in arms and trial make
what is the mind of troy if hector slain
they from the citadel intend retreat
or still despite their loss their ground maintain
but wherefore entertain such thoughts my soul
beside the ships unwept unburied lies
patroclus whom i never can forget
while numberd with the living and my limbs
have powr to move in hades though the dead
may be forgotten yet een there will i
the memry of my lovd companion keep
now to the ships return we sons of greece
glad paeans singing with us he shall go
great glory is ours the godlike hector slain
the pride of troy and as a god reverd

he said and foully hectors corpse misusd
of either foot he piercd the tendon through
that from the ancle passes to the heel
and to his chariot bound with leathern thongs
leaving the head to trail along the ground
then mounted with the capturd arms his car
and urgd his horses nothing loth they flew
a cloud of dust the trailing body raisd
loose hung his glossy hair and in the dust
was laid that noble head so graceful once
now to foul insult doomd by joves decree
in his own country by a foemans hand
so lay the head of hector at the sight
his aged mother tore her hair and far
from off her head the glittring veil she threw
and with loud cries her slaughterd son bewaild
piteous his father groand and all around
was heard the voice of wailing and of woe
such was the cry as if the beetling height
of ilium all were smouldring in the fire
scarce in his anguish could the crowd restrain
the old man from issuing through the dardan gates
low in the dust he rolld imploring all
entreating by his name each sevral man
forbear my friends though sorrowing stay me not
leave me to reach alone the grecian ships
and there implore this man of violence
this haughty chief if haply he my years
may revrence and have pity on my age
for he too has a father like to me
peleus by whom he was begot and bred
the bane of troy and most of all to me
the cause of endless grief who by his hand
have been of many stalwart sons bereft
yet all though grievd for all i less lament
than one whose loss will sink me to the grave
hector oh would to heavn that in mine arms
he could have died with mourning then and tears
we might have satisfied our grief both she
who bore him hapless mother and myself

weeping he spoke and with him wept the crowd
then mid the women hecuba pourd forth
her vehement grief my child oh whither now
heartstricken shall i go of thee bereft
of thee who wast to me by night and day
a glory and a boast the strength of all
the men of troy and women as a god
they worshippd thee for in thy life thou wast
the glory of all but fate hath found thee now

weeping she spoke but nought as yet was known
to hectors wife to her no messenger
had brought the tidings that without the walls
remained her husband in her house withdrawn
a web she wove all purple double woof
with varied flowrs in rich embroidery
and to her neathaird maidens gave command
to place the largest caldrons on the fire
that with warm baths returning from the fight
hector might be refreshd unconscious she
that by achilles hand with pallas aid
far from the bath was godlike hector slain
the sounds of wailing reachd her from the towr
totterd her limbs the distaff left her hand
and to her neathaird maidens thus she spoke
haste follow me some two that i may know
what mean these sounds my honourd mothers voice
i hear and in my breast my beating heart
leaps to my mouth my limbs refuse to move
some evil sure on priams house impends
be unfulfilld my words yet much i fear
lest my brave hector be cut off alone
by great achilles from the walls of troy
chasd to the plain the desprate courage quenchd
which ever led him from the genral ranks
far in advance and bade him yield to none

then from the house she rushd like one distract
with beating heart and with her went her maids
but when she reachd the towr where stood the crowd
and mounted on the wall she lookd around
and saw the body which with insult foul
the flying steeds were dragging towards the ships
then sudden darkness overspread her eyes
backward she fell and gaspd her spirit away
far off were flung th adornments of her head
the net the fillet and the woven bands
the nuptial veil by golden venus givn
that day when hector of the glancing helm
led from eetions house his wealthy bride
the sisters of her husband round her pressd
and held as in the deadly swoon she lay
but when her breath and spirit returnd again
with sudden burst of anguish thus she cried
hector oh woe is me to misery
we both were born alike thou here in troy
in priams royal palace i in thebes
by wooded placos in eetions house
who nursd my infancy unhappy he
unhappier i would i had neer been born
now thou beneath the depths of earth art gone
gone to the viewless shades and me hast left
a widow in thy house in deepest woe
our child an infant still thy child and mine
illfated parents both nor thou to him
hector shalt be a guard nor he to thee
for though he scape this tearful war with greece
yet nought for him remains but ceaseless woe
and strangers on his heritage shall seize
no young companions own the orphan boy
with downcast eyes and cheeks bedewd with tears
his fathers friends approaching pinchd with want
he hangs upon the skirt of one of one
he plucks the cloak perchance in pity some
may at their tables let him sip the cup
moisten his lips but scarce his palate touch
while youths with both surviving parents blessd
may drive him from their feast with blows and taunts
begone thy father sits not at our board
then weeping to his widowd mothers arms
he flies that orphan boy astyanax
who on his fathers knees erewhile was fed
on choicest marrow and the fat of lambs
and when in sleep his childish play was hushd
was lulld to slumber in his nurses arms
on softest couch by all delights surrounded
but grief his father lost awaits him now
astyanax of trojans so surnamd
since thou alone wast troys defence and guard
but now on thee beside the beaked ships
far from thy parents when the ravning dogs
have had their fill the wriggling worms shall feed
on thee all naked while within thy house
lies store of raiment rich and rare the work
of womens hands these will i burn with fire
not for thy needthou neer shalt wear them more
but for thine honour in the sight of troy

weeping she spoke the women joind her wail




thus they throughout the city made their moan
but when the greeks had come where lay their ships
by the broad hellespont their sevral ways
they each pursud dispersing yet not so
achilles let his myrmidons disperse
but thus his warlike comrades he addressd

my faithful comrades valiant myrmidons
loose we not yet our horses from the cars
but for patroclus mourn approaching near
with horse and car such tribute claim the dead
then free indulgence to our sorrows givn
loose we the steeds and share the evning meal

he said and they with mingled voices raisd
the solemn dirge achilles led the strain
thrice round the dead they drove their sleekskinnd steeds
mourning with hearts by thetis griefinspird
with tears the sands with tears the warriors arms
were wet so mighty was the chief they mournd
then on his comrades breast achilles laid
his bloodstaind hands and thus began the wail

all hail patroclus though in plutos realm
all that i promisd lo i now perform
that on the corpse of hector hither draggd
our dogs should feed and that twelve noble youths
the sons of troy before thy funral pyre
my hand in vengeance for thy death should slay

he said and foully hectors corpse misusd
flung prostrate in the dust beside the couch
where lay menoetius son his comrades then
their glittring armour doffd of polishd brass
and loosd their neighing steeds then round the ship
of peleus son in countless numbers sat
while he th abundant funral feast dispensd
there many a steer lay stretchd beneath the knife
and many a sheep and many a bleating goat
and many a whitetuskd porker rich in fat
there lay extended singeing oer the fire
and blood in torrents flowd around the corpse
to agamemnon then the kings of greece
the royal son of peleus swift of foot
conducted yet with him they scarce prevaild
so fierce his anger for his comrades death
but when to agamemnons tent they came
he to the clearvoicd heralds gave command
an ample tripod on the fire to place
if haply peleus son he might persuade
to wash away the bloody stains of war
but sternly he and with an oath refusd

no by great jove i swear of all the gods
highest and mightiest water shall not touch
this head of mine till on the funral pyre
i see the body of patroclus laid
and build his tomb and cut my votive hair
for while i live and move mid mortal men
no second grief like this can pierce my soul
observe we now the mournful funral feast
but thou great agamemnon king of men
send forth at early dawn and to the camp
bring store of fuel and all else prepare
that with provision meet the dead may pass
down to the realms of night so shall the fire
from out our sight consume our mighty dead
and to their wonted tasks the troops return

he said they listend and his words obeyd
then busily the evning meal prepard
and shard the social feast nor lackd there aught
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
each to their sevral tents the rest repaird
but on the manydashing oceans shore
pelides lay amid his myrmidons
with bitter groans in a clear space he lay
where broke the waves continuous on the beach
there circumfusd around him gentle sleep
lulling the sorrows of his heart to rest
oercame his senses for the hot pursuit
of hector round the breezy heights of troy
his active limbs had wearied as he slept
sudden appeard patroclus mournful shade
his very self his height and beauteous eyes
and voice the very garb he wont to wear
above his head it stood and thus it spoke

sleepst thou achilles mindless of thy friend
neglecting not the living but the dead
hasten my funral rites that i may pass
through hades gloomy gates ere those be done
the spirits and spectres of departed men
drive me far from them nor allow to cross
th abhorred river but forlorn and sad
i wander through the widespread realms of night
and give me now thy hand whereon to weep
for never more when laid upon the pyre
shall i return from hades never more
apart from all our comrades shall we two
as friends sweet counsel take for me stern death
the common lot of man has opd his mouth
thou too achilles rival of the gods
art destind here beneath the walls of troy
to meet thy doom yet one thing must i add
and make if thou wilt grant it one request
let not my bones be laid apart from thine
achilles but together as our youth
was spent together in thy fathers house
since first my sire menoetius me a boy
from opus brought a luckless homicide
who of amphidamas by evil chance
had slain the son disputing oer the dice
me noble peleus in his house receivd
and kindly nursd and thine attendant namd
so in one urn be now our bones enclosd
the golden vase thy goddessmothers gift

whom answerd thus achilles swift of foot
why art thou here lovd being why on me
these sevral charges lay whateer thou biddst
will i perform and all thy mind fulfil
but draw thou near and in one short embrace
let us while yet we may our grief indulge

thus as he spoke he spread his longing arms
but nought he claspd and with a wailing cry
vanishd like smoke the spirit beneath the earth
up sprang achilles all amazd and smote
his hands together and lamenting cried

o heavn there are then in the realms below
spirits and spectres unsubstantial all
for through the night patroclus shade hath stood
weeping and wailing at my side and told
his bidding th image of himself it seemd

he said his words the genral grief arousd
to them as round the piteous dead they mournd
appeard the rosyfingerd morn and straight
from all the camp by agamemnon sent
went forth in search of fuel men and mules
led by a valiant chief meriones
the follower of renownd idomeneus
their felling axes in their hands they bore
and twisted ropes their mules before them drivn
now up now down now sideways now aslope
they journeyd on but when they reachd the foot
of springabounding ida they began
with axes keen to hew the lofty oaks
they loudly crashing fell the wood they clove
and bound it to the mules these took their way
through the thick brushwood hurrying to the plain
the axemen too so bade meriones
the follower of renownd idomeneus
were laden all with logs which on the beach
they laid in order where a lofty mound
in memry of patroclus and himself
achilles had designd when all the store
of wood was duly laid the rest remaind
in masses seated but achilles bade
the warlike myrmidons their armour don
and harness each his horses to his car
they rose and donnd their arms and on the cars
warriors and charioteers their places took

first came the horse and then a cloud of foot
unnumberd in the midst patroclus came
borne by his comrades all the corpse with hair
they coverd oer which from their heads they shore
behind achilles held his head and mournd
the noble friend whom to the tomb he bore
then on the spot by peleus son assignd
they laid him down and pild the wood on high
then a fresh thought achilles mind conceivd
standing apart the yellow locks he shore
which as an offring to sperchius stream
he nursd in rich profusion sorrowing then
lookd oer the darkblue sea as thus he spoke

sperchius all in vain to thee his prayr
my father peleus made and vowd that i
returnd in safety to my native land
to thee should dedicate my hair and pay
a solemn hecatomb with sacrifice
of fifty rams unblemishd to the springs
where on thy consecrated soil is placd
thine incensehonourd altar so he vowd
but thou the boon withholdst since i no more
my native land may see the hair he vowd
to brave patroclus thus i dedicate

he said and on his comrades hand he laid
the locks his act the genral grief arousd
and now the setting sun had found them still
indulging oer the dead but peleus son
approaching thus to agamemnon spoke

atrides for to thee the people pay
readiest obedience mourning too prolongd
may weary thou then from the pyre the rest
disperse and bid prepare the morning meal
ours be the farther charge to whom the dead
was chiefly dear yet let the chiefs remain

the monarch agamemnon heard and straight
dispersd the crowd amid their sevral ships
th appointed band remaind and pild the wood
a hundred feet each way they built the pyre
and on the summit sorrowing laid the dead
then many a sheep and many a slowpaced ox
they flayd and dressd around the funral pyre
of all the beasts achilles took the fat
and coverd oer the corpse from head to foot
and heapd the slaughterd carcases around
then jars of honey placd and fragrant oils
resting upon the couch next groaning loud
four powrful horses on the pyre he threw
then of nine dogs that at their masters board
had fed he slaughterd two upon his pyre
last with the sword by evil counsel swayd
twelve noble youths he slew the sons of troy
the fires devouring might he then applied
and groaning on his lovd companion calld

all hail patroclus though in plutos realm
all that i promisd lo i now perform
on twelve brave sons of trojan sires with thee
the flames shall feed but hector priams son
not to the fire but to the dogs i give

such was achilles threat but him the dogs
molested not for venus night and day
daughter of jove the ravning dogs restraind
and all the corpse oerlaid with roseate oil
ambrosial that though draggd along the earth
the noble dead might not receive a wound
apollo too a cloudy veil from heavn
spread oer the plain and coverd all the space
where lay the dead nor let the blazing sun
the flesh upon his limbs and muscles parch
yet burnt not up patroclus funral pyre
then a fresh thought achilles mind conceivd
standing apart on both the winds he calld
boreas and zephyrus and added vows
of costly sacrifice and pouring forth
libations from a golden goblet prayd
their presence that the wood might haste to burn
and with the fire consume the dead his prayr
swift iris heard and bore it to the winds
they in the hall of gusty zephyrus
were gatherd round the feast in haste appearing
swift iris on the stony threshold stood
they saw and rising all besought her each
to sit beside him she with their requests
refusd compliance and addressd them thus

no seat for me for i oer th ocean stream
from hence am bound to æthiopias shore
to share the sacred feast and hecatombs
which there they offer to th immortal gods
but boreas thee and loudvoicd zephyrus
with vows of sacrifice achilles calls
to fan the funral pyre whereon is laid
patroclus mournd by all the host of greece

she said and vanishd they with rushing sound
rose and before them drove the hurrying clouds
soon oer the sea they swept the stirring breeze
ruffled the waves the fertile shores of troy
they reachd and falling on the funral pyre
loud roard the crackling flames they all night long
with current brisk together fannd the fire
all night achilles from a golden bowl
drew forth and in his hand a double cup
the wine outpouring moistend all the earth
still calling on his lost patroclus shade
as mourns a father oer a youthful son
whose early death hath wrung his parents hearts
so mournd achilles oer his friends remains
prostrate beside the pyre and groand aloud
but when the star of lucifer appeard
the harbinger of light whom following close
spreads oer the sea the saffronrobed morn
then pald the smouldring fire and sank the flame
and oer the thracian sea that groand and heavd
beneath their passage home the winds returnd
and weary from the pyre a space withdrawn
achilles lay oercome by gentle sleep

anon awakend by the tramp and din
of crowds that followd atreus royal son
he sat upright and thus addressd his speech

thou son of atreus and ye chiefs of greece
far as the flames extended quench we first
with ruddy wine the embers of the pyre
and of menoetius son patroclus next
with care distinguishing collect the bones
nor are they hard to know for in the midst
he lay while round the edges of the pyre
horses and men commixd the rest were burnt
let these between a double layer of fat
enclosd and in a golden urn remain
till i myself shall in the tomb be laid
and oer them build a mound not overlarge
but of proportions meet in days to come
ye greeks who after me shall here remain
complete the work and build it broad and high

thus spoke achilles they his words obeyd
far as the flames had reachd and thickly strown
the embers lay they quenchd with ruddy wine
then tearfully their gentle comrades bones
collected and with double layers of fat
enclosd and in a golden urn encasd
then in the tent they laid them overspread
with veil of linen fair then meting out
th allotted space the deep foundations laid
around the pyre and oer them heapd the earth
their task accomplished all had now withdrawn
but peleus son the vast assembly stayd
and bade them sit then prizes of the games
tripods and caldrons from the tents he brought
and noble steeds and mules and sturdy steers
and women fair of form and iron hoar

first for the contest of the flying cars
the prizes he displayd a woman fair
well skilld in household cares a tripod vast
twohandled two and twenty measures round
these both were for the victor for the next
a mare unbroken six years old in foal
of a mule colt the third a caldron bright
capacious of four measures white and pure
by fire as yet untarnishd for the fourth
of gold two talents for the fifth a vase
with double cup untouchd by fire he gave
then standing up he thus addressd the greeks

thou son of atreus and ye wellgreavd greeks
before ye are the prizes which await
the contest of the cars but if ye greeks
for any other cause these games were held
i to my tent should bear the foremost prize
for well ye know how far my steeds excel
steeds of immortal race which neptune gave
to peleus he to me his son transferrd
but from the present strife we stand aloof
my horses and myself they now have lost
the daring courage and the gentle hand
of him who drove them and with water pure
washd oft their manes and bathd with fragrant oil
for him they stand and mourn with drooping heads
down to the ground their hearts with sorrow filld
but ye in order range yourselves who boast
your wellbuilt chariots and your horses speed

he said up sprang the eager charioteers
the first of all eumelus king of men
son of admetus matchless charioteer
next tydeus son the valiant diomed
with trojan horses from æneas won
when by apollos aid himself escapd
then heavnborn menelaus atreus son
two flying coursers harnessd to his car
his own podargus had for yokefellow
æthe a mare by agamemnon lent
her echepolus to atrides gave
anchises son that to the wars of troy
he might not be compelld but safe at home
enjoy his ease for jove had blessd his store
with ample wealth in sicyons wide domain
her now he yokd impatient for the course
the fourth antilochus the gallant son
of nestor son of neleus mighty chief
harnessd his sleekskinnd steeds of pylian race
were they who bore his car to him his sire
sage counsel pourd in understanding ears

antilochus though young in years thou art
yet jove and neptune love thee and have well
instructed thee in horsemanship of me
thou needst no counsel skilld around the goal
to whirl the chariot but thou hast of all
the slowest horses whence i augur ill
but though their horses have the speed of thine
in skill not one of them surpasses thee
then thou dear boy exert thine evry art
that so thou mayst not fail to gain a prize
by skill far more than strength the woodman fells
the sturdy oak by skill the steersman guides
his flying ship across the darkblue sea
though shatterd by the blast twixt charioteer
and charioteer tis skill that draws the line
one vainly trusting to his coursers speed
drives reckless here and there oer all the course
his horses unrestraind at random run
another with inferior horses far
but better skilld still fixing on the goal
his eye turns closely round nor overlooks
the moment when to draw the rein but holds
his steady course and on the leader waits
a mark i give thee now thou canst not miss
there stands a witherd trunk some six feet high
of oak or pine unrotted by the rain
on either side have two white stones been placd
where meet two roads and all around there lies
a smooth and level course here stood perchance
the tomb of one who died long years ago
or former generations here have placd
as now achilles hath decreed a goal
there drive as only not to graze the post
and leaning oer the wicker body leave
close on the left the stones thine offside horse
then urge with voice and whip and slack his rein
and let the nearside horse so closely graze
as that thy nave may seem to touch the goal
but yet beware lest striking on the stone
thy steeds thou injure and thy chariot break
a source of triumph to thy rivals all
of shame to thee but thou sage caution use
for following if thou make the turn the first
not one of all shall pass thee or oertake
not though arions self were in the car
adrastus flying steed of heavnly race
nor those which here laomedon possessd

this said and to his son his counsels givn
the aged nestor to his seat withdrew
fifth in the lists meriones appeard
they mounted on their cars and cast their lots
achilles shook the helmet first leaped forth
the lot of nestors son antilochus
next came the king eumelus after whom
the valiant menelaus atreus son
the fourth meriones and last of all
but ablest far tydides drew his place
they stood in line achilles pointed out
ear on the level plain the distant goal
and there in charge the godlike phoenix placd
his fathers ancient follower to observe
the course assignd and true report to make
then all at once their whips they raisd and urgd
by rein and hand and voice their eager steeds
they from the ships pursued their rapid course
athwart the distant plain beneath their chests
rose like a cloud or hurricane the dust
loose floated on the breeze their ample manes
the cars now skimmd along the fertile ground
now bounded high in air the charioteers
stood up aloft and evry bosom beat
with hope of victry each with eager shout
cheering his steeds that scourd the dusty plain
but when the farthest limits of the course
attaind they turnd beside the hoary sea
straind to their utmost speed were plainly seen
the qualities of each then in the front
appeard eumelus flying mares and next
the trojan horses of tydides came
nor these were far behind but following close
they seemd in act to leap upon the car
eumelus on his neck and shoulders broad
felt their warm breath for oer him as they flew
their heads were downward bent and now perchance
had he or passd or made an even race
but that incensd with valiant diomed
apollo wrested from his hands the whip
then tears of anger from his eyelids fell
as gaining more and more the mares he saw
while urgd no more his horses slackd their speed
but pallas markd apollos treachrous wile
and hasting to the chief restord his whip
and to his horses strength and courage gave
the goddess then admetus son pursued
and snappd his chariot yoke the mares releasd
swervd from the track the pole upon the ground
lay loosend from the car and he himself
beside the wheel was from the chariot hurld
from elbows mouth and nose the skin was torn
his forehead crushd and batterd in his eyes
were filld with tears and mute his cheerful voice
tydides turnd aside and far ahead
of all the rest passd on for pallas gave
his horses courage and his triumph willd
next him the fairhaird menelaus came
the son of atreus but antilochus
thus to his fathers horses calld aloud

forward and stretch ye to your utmost speed
i ask you not with those of diomed
in vain to strive whom pallas hath endued
with added swiftness and his triumph willd
but haste ye and oertake atrides car
nor be by æthe by a mare disgracd
why my brave horses why be left behind
this too i warn ye and will make it good
no more at nestors hand shall ye receive
your provender but with the sword be slain
if by your faults a lower prize be ours
then rouse ye now and put forth all your speed
and i will so contrive as not to fail
of slipping past them in the narrow way

he said the horses of his voice in awe
put forth their powrs awhile before them soon
antilochus the narrow pass espied
it was a gully where the winters rain
had lain collected and had broken through
a length of road and hollowd out the ground
there menelaus held his cautious course
fearing collision but antilochus
drawing his steeds a little from the track
bore down upon him sideways then in fear
the son of atreus to antilochus
shouted aloud antilochus thou drivst
like one insane hold in awhile thy steeds
here is no space where wider grows the road
there thou mayst pass but here thou wilt but cause
our cars to clash and bring us both to harm

he said but madlier drove antilochus
plying the goad as though he heard him not

far as a discus flight by some stout youth
that tests his vigour from the shoulder hurld
so far they ran together side by side
then droppd atrides horses to the rear
for he himself forbore to urge their speed
lest meeting in the narrow pass the cars
should be oerthrown and they themselves in haste
to gain the victry in the dust be rolld
then thus reproachful to antilochus

antilochus thou most perverse of men
beshrew thy heart we greeks are much deceivd
who give thee fame for wisdom yet een now
thou shalt not gain but on thine oath the prize

he said and to his horses calld aloud
slack not your speed nor as defeated mourn
their legs and feet will sooner tire than yours
for both are past the vigour of their youth
thus he the horses of his voice in awe
put forth their powrs and soon the leaders neard

meanwhile the chieftains seated in the ring
lookd for the cars that scourd the dusty plain
the first to see them was idomeneus
the cretan king for he without the ring
was posted high aloft and from afar
he heard and knew the foremost horsemans voice
well too he knew the gallant horse that led
all bay the rest but on his front alone
a star of white fullorbed as the moon
then up he rose and thus the greeks addressd

o friends the chiefs and councillors of greece
can ye too see or i alone the cars
a diffrent chariot seems to me in front
a diffrent charioteer and they who first
were leading must have met with some mischance
i saw them late ere round the goal they turnd
but see them now no more though all around
my eyes explore the widespread plain of troy
perchance the charioteer has droppd the reins
or round the goal he could not hold the mares
perchance has missd the turn and on the plain
is lying now beside his broken car
while from the course his mettled steeds have flown
stand up and look yourselves i cannot well
distinguish but to me it seems a chief
who reigns oer greeks though of ætolian race
the son of tydeus valiant diomed

sharply oileus active son replied
idomeneus why thus before the time
so rashly speak while the highstepping steeds
are speeding yet across the distant plain
thine eyes are not the youngest in the camp
nor look they out the sharpest from thy head
but thou art ever hasty in thy speech
and ill becomes thee this precipitance
since others are there here thy betters far
the same are leading now that led at first
eumelus mares tis he that holds the reins

to whom in anger thus the cretan chief
ajax at wrangling good in judgment naught
and for aught else among the chiefs of greece
of small accountso stubborn is thy soul
wilt thou a tripod or a caldron stake
and agamemnon atreus son appoint
the umpire to decide whose steeds are first
so shalt thou gain thy knowledge at thy cost

he said up sprang oileus active son
in anger to reply and farther yet
had gone the quarrel but achilles self
stood up and thus the rival chiefs addressd

forbear both ajax and idomeneus
this bitter interchange of wordy war
it is not seemly and yourselves i know
another would condemn who so should speak
but stay ye here and seated in the ring
their coming wait they hurrying to the goal
will soon be here and then shall each man know
whose horses are the second whose the first

thus he but tydeus son drew near his lash
still laid upon his horses shoulderpoints
as lightly they highstepping scourd the plain
still on the charioteer the dust was flung
as close upon the flyingfooted steeds
followd the car with gold and tin inlaid
and lightly as they flew along were left
impressd the wheeltracks on the sandy plain
there in the midst he stood the sweat profuse
downpouring from his horses heads and chests
down from the glittring car he leapd to earth
and leand his whip against the chariot yoke
nor long delayd the valiant sthenelus
but eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize
then to his brave companions gave in charge
to lead away the woman and to bear
the tripod while himself unyokd the steeds

nest came the horses of antilochus
who had by stratagem and not by speed
oer menelaus triumphd yet een so
atrides flying coursers pressd him hard
for but so far as from the chariotwheel
a horse when harnessd to a royal car
whose tail backstreaming with the utmost hairs
brushes the felloes close before the wheel
small space between he scours the widespread plain
so far was menelaus in the rear
of nestors son at first a discus cast
between them lay but rapidly his ground
he gaindso well the speed and courage servd
of æthe agamemnons beauteous mare
and but a little farther were the course
had passd him by nor left the race in doubt
behind the noble son of atreus came
a javlins flight apart meriones
the faithful follower of idomeneus
his were the slowest horses and himself
the least experiencd in the rapid race
dragging his broken car came last of all
his horses drivn in front admetus son
achilles swift of foot with pity saw
and to the greeks his winged words addressd

see where the best of all the last appears
but let him take as meet the second prize
the first belongs of right to tydeus son

thus he they all assented to his words
and by the genral voice of greece the mare
had now been his but noble nestors son
antilochus stood up his right to claim
and to achilles peleus son replied
achilles thou wilt do me grievous wrong
if thou thy words accomplish for my prize
thou takst away because mishap befell
his car and horses by no fault of his
yet had he to th immortals made his prayr
he surely had not thus been last of all
but pitying him if so thy mind incline
thy tents contain good store of gold and brass
and sheep and female slaves and noble steeds
for him of these hereafter mayst thou take
a prize of higher value or een now
and with th applause of all but for the mare
i will not give her up and let who will
stand forth my own right hand shall guard my prize

he said and smild achilles swift of foot
delighted for he lovd the noble youth
to whom his winged words he thus addressd

antilochus if such be thy request
that for eumelus i should add a prize
this too i grant thee and to him i give
my breastplate from asteropaeus won
of brass around whose edge is rolld a stream
of shining tin a gift of goodly price

he said and bade automedon his friend
and comrade bring the breastplate from his tent
he went and brought it in eumelus hand
he placd it he with joy the gift receivd
then menelaus sad at heart arose
burning with wrath against antilochus
and while the herald in the monarchs hand
his royal sceptre placd and bade the greeks
keep silence thus the godlike hero spoke

antilochus till now reputed wise
what hast thou done thou hast impugnd my skill
and shamd my horses who hast brought thine own
inferior far before them to the goal
but come ye chiefs and councillors of greece
judge ye between us favring neither side
that none of all the brassclad greeks may say
that menelaus hath by false reports
oerborne antilochus and holds his prize
his horses fairly worsted and himself
triumphant only by superior powr
or come now i myself will judgment give
nor deem i any greek will find to blame
in my decision for tis fair and just
antilochus come forward noble chief
and standing as tis meet before the car
and horses in thy hand the slender whip
wherewith thou drovst upon the horses lay
thy hand and by earthshaking neptune swear
that not of malice and by set design
thou didst by fraud impede my chariots course

to whom antilochus with prudent speech
have patience with me yet for i o king
o menelaus am thy junior far
my elder and superior thee i own
thou knowst th oereager vehemence of youth
how quick in temper and in judgment weak
set then thy heart at ease the mare i won
i freely give and if aught else of mine
thou shouldst desire would sooner give it all
than all my life be lowrd illustrious king
in thine esteem and sin against the gods

thus saying noble nestors son led forth
and placd in menelaus hands the mare
the monarchs soul was melted like the dew
which glitters on the ears of growing corn
that bristle oer the plain een so thy soul
o menelaus melted at his speech
to whom were thus addressd thy winged words

antilochus at once i lay aside
my anger thou art prudent and not apt
to be thus led astray but now thy youth
thy judgment hath oerpowrd seek not henceforth
by trickry oer thine elders to prevail
to any other man of all the greeks
i scarce so much had yielded but for that
thyself hast labourd much and much endurd
thou thy good sire and brother in my cause
i yield me to thy prayrs and give to boot
the mare though mine of right that these may know
i am not of a harsh unyielding mood

he said and to noemon gave in charge
the faithful comrade of antilochus
the mare himself the glittring caldron took
of gold two talents to the fourth assignd
fourth in the race meriones receivd
still the fifth prize a vase with double cup
remaind achilles this to nestor gave
before th assembled greeks as thus he spoke

take this old man and for an heirloom keep
in memry of patroclus funral games
whom thou no more amid the greeks shalt see
freely i give it thee for thou no more
canst box or wrestle or in sportive strife
the javlin throw or race with flying feet
for age with heavy hand hath bowd thee down

he said and placd it in his hand th old man
beceivd with joy the gift and thus replied

all thou hast said my son is simple truth
no firmness now my limbs and feet retain
nor can my arms with freedom as of old
straight from the shoulder right and left strike out
oh that such youth and vigour yet were mine
as when th epeians in buprasium held
the royal amarynceus funral games
and when the monarchs sons his prizes gave
then could not one of all th epeian race
or pylians or ætolians vie with me
in boxing clytomedes œnops son
i vanquished then anchaeus who stood up
to wrestle with me i with ease oerthrew
iphiclus i outran though fleet of foot
in hurling with the spear with phyleus strove
and polydorus and surpassd them both
the sons of actor in the chariotrace
alone oercame me as in number more
and grudging more my triumph since remaind
this contest to reward the richest prize
they were twin brothers one who held the reins
still drove and drove the other plied the whip
such was i once but now must younger men
engage in deeds like these and i the chief
of heroes once must bow to weary age
but honour thou with fitting funral games
thy comrade i accept wellpleasd thy gift
my heart rejoicing that thou still retainst
of me a kindly memry nor oerlookst
the place of honour which among the greeks
belongs to me of right for this the gods
reward thee with a worthy recompense

he said achilles listend to the praise
of neleus son then joind the genral throng
next he set forth the prizes to reward
the labours of the sturdy pugilists
a hardy mule he tetherd in the ring
unbroken six years old most hard to tame
and for the vanquished man a double cup
then rose and to the greeks proclaimd aloud

thou son of atreus and ye wellgreavd greeks
for these we bid two champions brave stand forth
and in the boxers manly toil contend
and he whose stern endurance phoebus crowns
with victry recognizd by all the greeks
he to his tent shall lead the hardy mule
the loser shall the double cup receive

he said up sprang epeius tall and stout
a boxer skilld the son of panopeus
who laid his hand upon the mule and said

stand forth if any care the cup to win
the mule methinks no greek can bear away
from me who glory in the champions name
ist not enough that in the battlefield
i claim no special praise tis not for man
in all things to excel but this i say
and will make good my words who meets me here
i mean to pound his flesh and smash his bones
see that his seconds be at hand and prompt
to bear him from the ring by me subdued

he said they all in silence heard his speech
only euryalus a godlike chief
son of mecistheus talaions son
stood forth opposing he had once in thebes
joind in the funral games of œdipus
and there had vanquishd all of cadmian race
on him attended valiant diomed
with cheering words and wishes of success
around his waist he fastend first the belt
then gave the wellcut gauntlets for his hands
of wild bulls hide when both were thus equippd
into the centre of the ring they steppd
there face to face with sinewy arms upraisd
they stood awhile then closd strong hand with hand
mingling in rapid interchange of blows
dire was the clatter of their jaws the sweat
pourd forth profuse from evry limb then rushd
epeius on and full upon the cheek
half turnd aside let fall a staggring blow
nor stood euryalus but legs and feet
knockd from beneath him prone to earth he fell
and as a fish that flounders on the sand
thrown by rude boreas on the weedy beach
till coverd oer by the returning wave
so flounderd he beneath that stunning blow
but brave epeius took him by the hand
and raisd him up his comrades crowded round
and bore him from the field with dragging steps
spitting forth clotted gore his heavy head
rolling from side to side within his tent
they laid him down unconscious to the ring
then back returning bore away the cup

achilles next before the greeks displayd
the prizes of the hardy wrestlers skill
the victors prize a tripod vast fireproof
and at twelve oxen by the greeks appraisd
and for the vanquishd man a female slave
pricd at four oxen skilld in household work
then rose and loudly to the greeks proclaimd
stand forth whoeer this contest will essay

he said and straight uprose the giant form
of ajax telamon with him uprose
ulysses skilld in evry crafty wile
girt with the belt within the ring they stood
and each with stalwart grasp laid hold on each
as stand two rafters of a lofty house
each propping each by skilful architect
designd the tempests fury to withstand
creakd their backbones beneath the tug and strain
of those strong arms their sweat pourd down like rain
and bloody weals of livid purple hue
their sides and shoulders streakd as sternly they
for victry and the wellwrought tripod strove
nor could ulysses ajax overthrow
nor ajax bring ulysses to the ground
so stubbornly he stood but when the greeks
were weary of the longprotracted strife
thus to ulysses mighty ajax spoke
ulysses sage laertes godlike son
or lift thou me or i will thee uplift
the issue of our struggle rests with jove

he said and raisd ulysses from the ground
nor he his ancient craft rememberd not
but lockd his leg around and striking sharp
upon the hollow of the knee the joint
gave way the giant ajax backwards fell
ulysses on his breast the people saw
and marvelld then in turn ulysses strove
ajax to lift a little way he movd
but faild to lift him fairly from the ground
yet crookd his knee that both together fell
and side by side defild with dust they lay

and now a third encounter had they tried
but rose achilles and the combat stayd

forbear nor waste your strength in farther strife
ye both are victors both then bear away
an equal meed of honour and withdraw
that other greeks may other contests wage
thus spoke achilles they his words obeyd
and brushing off the dust their garments donnd

the prizes of the runners swift of foot
achilles next set forth a silver bowl
six measures its content for workmanship
unmatchd on earth of sidons costliest art
the product rare thence oer the misty sea
brought by phoenicians who in port arrivd
gave it to thoas by euneus last
the son of jason to patroclus paid
in ransom of lycaon priams son
which now achilles on his friends behalf
assignd as his reward whoeer should prove
the lightest foot and speediest in the race
a steer well fattend was the second prize
and half a talent for the third of gold
he rose and to the greeks proclaimd aloud
stand forth whoeer this contest will essay
he said uprose oileus active son
uprose ulysses skilld in evry wile
and noble nestors son antilochus
who all the youth in speed of foot surpassd
they stood in line achilles pointed out
the limits of the course as from the goal
they stretchd them to the race oileus son
first shot ahead ulysses following close
nor farther than the shuttle from the breast
of some fair woman when her outstretchd arm
has thrown the woof athwart the warp and back
withdraws it towrd her breast so close behind
ulysses pressd on ajax and his feet
trod in his steps ere settled yet the dust
his breath was on his shoulders as the plain
he lightly skimmd the greeks with eager shouts
still cheering as he straind to win the prize
but as they neard the goal ulysses thus
to blueeyd pallas made his mental prayr
now hear me goddess and my feet befriend
thus as he prayd his prayr the goddess heard
and all his limbs with active vigour filld
and as they stretchd their hands to seize the prize
trippd up by pallas ajax slippd and fell
amid the offal of the lowing kine
which oer patroclus peleus son had slain
his mouth and nostrils were with offal filld
first in the race ulysses bore away
the silver bowl the steer to ajax fell
and as upon the horn he laid his hand
sputtring the offal out he calld aloud
lo how the goddess has my steps bewrayd
who guards ulysses with a mothers care
thus as he spoke loud laughd the merry greeks
antilochus the sole remaining prize
receivd and laughing thus the greeks addressd

i tell you friends but what yourselves do know
how of the elder men th immortal gods
take special care for ajax years not much
exceed mine own but here we see a man
one of a former age and race of men
a hale old man we call him but for speed
not one can match him save achilles self

thus he with praise implied of peleus son
to whom in answer thus achilles spoke

antilochus not unobservd of me
nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain
to thy half talent add this second half

thus saying in his hand he placd the gold
antilochus with joy the gift receivd

next in the ring the son of peleus laid
a pondrous spear a helmet and a shield
the spoil patroclus from sarpedon won
then rose and loudly to the greeks proclaimd

for these we call upon two champions brave
to don their arms their sharpedgd weapons grasp
and public trial of their prowess make
and he who first his rivals flesh shall reach
and through his armour piercing first draw blood
he shall this silverstudded sword receive
my trophy from asteropaeus won
wellwrought of thracian metal but the arms
in common property they both shall hold
and in my tent a noble banquet share

he said uprose great ajax telamon
and tydeus son the valiant diomed
first from the crowd apart they donnd their arms
then eager for the fight with haughty stare
stood in the midst the greeks admiring gazd
when each approaching other near they came
thrice rushd they on and thrice in combat closd
then through the buckler round of diomed
great ajax drove his spear nor reachd the point
tydides body by the breastplate stayd
while aimd above the mighty shields defence
his glittring weapon flashd at ajax throat
for ajax fearing shouted then the greeks
to cease the fight and share alike the prize
but from achilles hand the mighty sword
with belt and scabbard diomed receivd

next in the ring the son of peleus placd
a pondrous mass of iron as a quoit
once wielded by eetions giant strength
but to the ships with other trophies borne
when by achilles hand eetion fell
then rose and loudly to the greeks proclaimd
stand forth whoeer this contest will essay
this prize who wins though widely may extend
his fertile fields for five revolving years
it will his wants supply nor to the town
for lack of iron with this mass in store
need he his shepherd or his ploughman send

he said and valiant polypoetes rose
epeius and leonteus godlike strength
and mighty ajax son of telamon
in turns they took their stand epeius first
upraisd the pondrous mass and through the air
hurld it amid the laughter of the greeks
next came leonteus scion true of mars
the third was ajax from whose stalwart hand
beyond the farthest mark the missile flew
but when the valiant polypoetes took
the quoit in hand far as a herdsman throws
his staff that whirling flies among the herd
so far beyond the rings extremest bound
he threw the pondrous mass loud were the shouts
and noble polypoetes comrades rose
and to the ships the monarchs gift conveyd

the archers prizes next of iron hoar
ten sturdy axes doubleedgd he placd
and single hatchets ten then far away
reard on the sand a darkprowd vessels mast
on which with slender string a timrous dove
was fastend by the foot the archers mark
that who should strike the dove should to his tent
the axes bear away but who the string
should sever but should fail to strike the bird
as less in skill the hatchets should receive
thus spoke achilles straight uprose the might
of royal teucer and meriones
the faithful follower of idomeneus
they in a brassbound helmet shook the lots
the first was teucers with impetuous force
he shot but vowd not to the archerking
of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb
the dove he struck not for the archergod
withheld his aid but close beside her foot
the arrow severd the retaining string
the bird releasd soard heavnward while the string
droppd from the mast suspended towrds the earth
and loudly shouted their applause the greeks
then snatchd meriones in haste the bow
from teucers hand his own already held
his arrow pointed straight he drew the string
and to the fardestroying king he vowd
of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb
aloft amid the clouds he markd the dove
and struck her as she soard beneath the wing
right through the arrow passd and to the earth
returning fell beside meriones
the bird upon the darkprowd vessels mast
lighted awhile anon with drooping head
and pinions fluttring vain afar she fell
lifeless th admiring crowd with wonder gazd
meriones the axes bore away
while teucer to the ships the hatchets bore

last in the ring the son of peleus laid
a pondrous spear and caldron burnishd bright
pricd at an oxs worth untouchd by fire
for those who with the javlin would contend
uprose then agamemnon king of men
the son of atreus and meriones
the faithful follower of idomeneus
but peleus godlike son addressd them thus

how far atrides thou excellst us all
and with the javlin what thy powr and skill
preeminent we know take thou this prize
and bear it to thy ships and let us give
to brave meriones the brazen spear
if so it please thee such were my advice

he said and agamemnon king of men
assenting gave to brave meriones
the brazen spear while in talthybius care
his herald placd the king his noble prize




the games were ended and the multitude
amid the ships their sevral ways dispersd
some to their supper some to gentle sleep
yielding delighted but achilles still
mournd oer his lovd companion not on him
lighted allconquring sleep but to and fro
restless he tossd and on patroclus thought
his vigour and his courage all the deeds
they two together had achievd the toils
the perils they had undergone amid
the strife of warriors and the angry waves
stirrd by such memries bitter tears he shed
now turning on his side and now again
upon his back then prone upon his face
then starting to his feet along the shore
all objectless despairing would he roam
nor did the morn above the sea appearing
unmarkd of him arise his flying steeds
he then would harness and behind the car
the corpse of hector trailing in the dust
thrice make the circuit of patroclus tomb
then would he turn within his tent to rest
leaving the prostrate corpse with dust defild
but from unseemly marks the valiant dead
apollo guarded who with pity viewd
the hero though in death and round him threw
his golden aegis nor though draggd along
allowd his body to receive a wound

thus foully did achilles in his rage
misuse the mighty dead the blessed gods
with pitying grief beheld the sight and urgd
that hermes should by stealth the corpse remove
the counsel pleasd the rest but juno still
and neptune and the blueeyd maid retaind
the hatred unappeasd with which of old
troy and her king and people they pursued
since paris to the rival goddesses
who to his sheepfold came gave deep offence
preferring her who brought him in return
the fatal boon of too successful love
but when the twelfth revolving day was come
apollo thus th assembled gods addressd
shame on ye gods ungrateful have ye not
at hectors hand of bulls and choicest goats
receivd your offrings meet and fear ye now
een his dead corpse to save and grant his wife
his mother and his child his aged sire
and people to behold him and to raise
his funral pile and with due rites entomb
but fell achilles all your aid commands
of mind unrighteous and inflexible
his stubborn heart his thoughts are all of blood
een as a lion whom his mighty strength
and dauntless courage lead to leap the fold
and mid the trembling flocks to seize his prey
een so achilles hath discarded ruth
and conscience arbiter of good and ill
a man may lose his bestlovd friend a son
or his own mothers son a brother dear
he mourns and weeps but time his grief allays
for fate to man a patient mind hath givn
but godlike hectors body after death
achilles unrelenting foully drags
lashd to his car around his comrades tomb
this is not to his praise though brave he be
yet thus our anger he may justly rouse
who in his rage insults the senseless clay

to whom indignant whitearmd juno thus
some show of reason were there in thy speech
god of the silver bow could hector boast
of equal dignity with peleus son
a mortal one and nursd at womans breast
the other of a goddess born whom i
nurturd and reard and to a mortal gave
in marriage gave to peleus best belovd
by all th immortals of the race of man
ye gods attended all the marriage rites
thou too companion base false friend wast there
and playing on thy lyre didst share the feast

to whom the cloudcompeller answerd thus
juno restrain thy wrath they shall not both
attain like honour yet was hector once
of all the mortals that in ilium dwell
dearest to all the gods and chief to me
for never did he fail his gifts to bring
and with burntoffrings and libations due
my altars crown such worship i receivd
yet shall bold hectors body not without
the knowledge of achilles be removd
for day and night his goddessmother keeps
her constant watch beside him then some god
bid thetis hither to my presence haste
and i with prudent words will counsel her
that so achilles may at priams hand
large ransom take and set brave hector free

he said and promptly on his errand sprang
the stormswift iris in the darkblue sea
she plungd midway twixt imbros rugged shore
and samos isle the parting waters plashd
as down to oceans lowest depths she droppd
like to a plummet which the fisherman
lets fall encasd in wild bulls horn to bear
destruction to the seas voracious tribes
there found she thetis in a hollow cave
around her rangd the ocean goddesses
she in the midst was weeping oer the fate
her matchless son awaiting doomd to die
far from his home on fertile plains of troy
swiftfooted iris at her side appeard
and thus addressd her hasten thetis jove
lord of immortal counsel summons thee
to whom the silverfooted goddess thus
what would with me the mighty king of heavn
pressd as i am with grief i am ashamd
to mingle with the gods yet will i go
nor shall he speak in vain whateer his words

thus as she spoke her veil the goddess took
all black than which none deeper could be found
she rose to go the stormswift iris led
the way before her oceans parted waves
around their path receded to the beach
ascending upwards straight to heavn they sprang
th allseeing son of saturn there they found
and rangd around him all th immortal gods
pallas made way and by the throne of jove
sat thetis juno proffring to her hand
a goblet fair of gold and adding words
of welcome she the cup receivd and drank
then thus began the sire of gods and men
thou thetis sorrowing to olympus comst
borne down by ceaseless grief i know it well
yet hear the cause for which i summond thee
about achilles thy victorious son
and valiant hectors body for nine days
hath contest been in heavn and some have urgd
that hermes should by stealth the corpse remove
this to achilles praise i mean to turn
and thus thy revrence and thy love retain
then haste thee to the camp and to thy son
my message bear tell him that all the gods
are filld with wrath and i above the rest
am angry that beside the beaked ships
he mad with rage the corpse of hector keeps
so may he fear me and restore the dead
iris meantime to priam i will send
and bid him seek the grecian ships and there
obtain his sons release and with him bring
such presents as may melt achilles heart

he said the silverfooted queen obeyd
down from olympus heights in haste she sped
and sought her son him found she in his tent
groaning with anguish while his comrades round
plying their tasks prepard the morning meal
for them a goodly sheep fullfleecd was slain
close by his side his goddessmother stood
and gently touchd him with her hand and said
how long my son wilt thou thy soul consume
with grief and mourning mindful nor of food
nor sleep nor dost thou wisely to abstain
from womans love for short thy time on earth
death and imperious fate are close at hand
hear then my words a messenger from jove
to thee i come to tell thee that the gods
are filld with wrath and he above the rest
is angry that beside the beaked ships
thou mad with rage the corpse of hector keepst
then ransom take and liberate the dead

to whom achilles swift of foot replied
so be it ransom let him bring and bear
his dead away if such the will of jove

thus in the concourse of the ships they two
mother and son their lengthend converse held

then saturns son to iris gave command
haste thee swift iris from olympus height
to troy to royal priam bear my words
and bid him seek the grecian ships and there
obtain his sons release and with him take
such presents as may melt achilles heart
alone no trojan with him must he go
yet may a herald on his steps attend
some aged man his smoothlyrolling car
and mules to drive and to the city back
to bring his dead whom great achilles slew
nor let the fear of death disturb his mind
hermes shall with him as his escort go
and to achilles presence safely bring
arrivd within the tent nor he himself
will slay him but from others will protect
not ignorant is he nor void of sense
nor disobedient to the gods behest
but will with pitying eyes his suppliant view

he said and on his errand sped in haste
the stormswift iris when to priams house
she came the sounds of wailing met her ear
within the court around their father sat
his sons their raiment all bedewd with tears
and in the midst close coverd with his robe
their sire his head and neck with dirt defild
which wallowing on the earth himself had heapd
with his own hands upon his hoary head
throughout the house his daughters loudly waild
in memry of the many and the brave
who lay in death by grecian warriors slain
beside him stood the messenger of jove
and whisperd while his limbs with terror shook
fear nothing priam son of dardanus
nor let thy mind be troubled not for ill
but here on kindly errand am i sent
to thee i come a messenger from jove
who from on high looks down on thee with eyes
of pitying love he bids thee ransom home
the godlike hectors corpse and with thee take
such presents as may melt achilles heart
alone no trojan with thee must thou go
yet may a herald on thy steps attend
some aged man thy smoothlyrolling car
and mules to drive and to the city back
to bring thy dead whom great achilles slew
nor let the fear of death disturb thy mind
hermes shall with thee as thine escort go
and to achilles presence safely bring
arrivd within the tent nor he himself
will slay thee but from others will protect
not ignorant is he nor void of sense
nor disobedient to the gods behest
but will with pitying eyes his suppliant view

swiftfooted iris said and vanishd straight
he to his sons commandment gave the mules
to yoke beneath the smoothlyrolling car
and on the axle fix the wicker seat
himself the lofty cedar chamber sought
fragrant highroofd with countless treasures stord
and calld to hecuba his wife and said
good wife a messenger from jove hath come
who bids me seek the grecian ships and there
obtain my sons release and with me take
such presents as may melt achilles heart
say then what thinkst thou for my mind inclines
to seek the ships within the grecian camp

so he but hecuba lamenting cried
alas alas where are thy senses gone
and where the wisdom once of high repute
mid strangers and mid those oer whom thou reignst
how canst thou think alone to seek the ships
entring his presence who thy sons hath slain
many and brave an iron heart is thine
of that bloodthirsty and perfidious man
if thou within the sight and reach shalt come
no pity will he feel no revrence show
rather remain we here apart and mourn
for him when at his birth his thread of life
was spun by fate twas destind that afar
from home and parents he should glut the maw
of ravning dogs by that stern warriors tent
whose inmost heart i would i could devour
such for my son were adequate revenge
whom not in ignominious flight he slew
but standing thoughtless of escape or flight
for trojan men and troys deepbosomd dames

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
seek not to hinder me nor be thyself
a bird of evil omen in my house
for thou shalt not persuade me if indeed
this message had been brought by mortal man
prophet or seer or sacrificing priest
i should have deemd it false and laughd to scorn
the idle tale but now  i must go
nor unfulfilld shall be the words i speak
and if indeed it be my fate to die
beside the vessels of the brassclad greeks
i am content by fierce achilles hand
let me be slain so once more in my arms
i hold my boy and give my sorrow vent
then raising up the coffers polishd lid
he chose twelve gorgeous shawls twelve single cloaks
as many rugs as many splendid robes
as many tunics then of gold he took
ten talents full two tripods burnishd bright
four caldrons then a cup of beauty rare
a rich possession which the men of thrace
had givn when there he went ambassador
een this he spard not such his keen desire
his son to ransom from the corridor
with angry words he drove the trojans all

out with ye worthless rascals vagabonds
have ye no griefs at home that here ye come
to pester me or is it not enough
that jove with deep affliction visits me
slaying my bravest son ye to your cost
shall know his loss since now that he is gone
the greeks shall find you easier far to slay
but may my eyes be closd in death ere see
the city sackd and utterly destroyd

he said and with his staff drove out the crowd
before the old mans anger fled they all
then to his sons in threatning tone he cried
to paris helenus and agathon
pammon antiphonus polites brave
deiphobus and bold hippothous
and godlike dius all these nine with threats
and angry taunts the aged sire assaild
haste worthless sons my scandal and my shame
would that ye all beside the grecian ships
in hectors stead had died oh woe is me
who have begotten sons in all the land
the best and bravest now remains not one
mestor and troilus dauntless charioteer
and hector who a god mid men appeard
nor like a mortals offspring but a gods
all these hath mars cut off and left me none
none but the vile and refuse liars all
vain skipping coxcombs in the dance alone
and in nought else renownd base plunderers
from their own countrymen of lambs and kids
when laggards will ye harness me the car
equippd with all things needed for the way

he said they quaild beneath their fathers wrath
and brought the smoothlyrunning mulewain out
wellframd newbuilt and fixd the wicker seat
then from the peg the muleyoke down they took
of boxwood wrought with boss and rings complete
and with the yoke the yokeband brought they forth
nine cubits long and to the polishd pole
at the far end attachd the breastrings then
fixd to the polepiece and on either side
thrice round the knob the leathern thong they wound
and bound it fast and inward turnd the tongue
then the rich ransom from the chambers brought
of hectors head upon the wain they pild
and yokd the stronghoofd mules to harness traind
the mysians splendid present to the king
to priams car they harnessd then the steeds
which he himself at polishd manger fed

deep thoughts revolving in the lofty halls
were met the herald and the aged king
when hecuba with troubled mind drew near
in her right hand a golden cup she bore
of luscious wine that ere they took their way
they to the gods might due libations pour
before the car she stood and thus she spoke
take and to father jove thine offring pour
and pray that he may bring thee safely home
from all thy foes since sore against my will
thou needs wilt venture to the ships of greece
then to idaean jove the cloudgirt son
of saturn who th expanse of troy surveys
prefer thy prayr beseeching him to send
on thy right hand a winged messenger
the bird he loves the best of strongest flight
that thou thyself mayst see and know the sign
and firm in faith approach the ships of greece
but should allseeing jove the sign withhold
then not with my consent shouldst thou attempt
whateer thy wish to reach the grecian ships

to whom in answer godlike priam thus
o woman i refuse not to obey
thy counsel good it is to raise the hands
in prayr to heavn and joves protection seek
the old man said and bade th attendant pour
pure water on his hands with ewer she
and basin stood beside him from his wife
the due ablutions made he took the cup
then in the centre of the court he stood
and as he pourd the wine lookd up to heavn
and thus with voice uplifted prayd aloud
o father jove who rulst on idas height
most great most glorious grant that i may find
some pity in achilles heart and send
on my right hand a winged messenger
the bird thou lovst the best of strongest flight
that i myself may see and know the sign
and firm in faith approach the ships of greece

thus as he prayd the lord of counsel heard
and sent forthwith an eagle featherd king
dark bird of chase and dusky thence surnamd
wide as the portals well securd with bolts
that guard some wealthy monarchs lofty hall
on either side his ample pinions spread
on the right hand appeard he far above
the city soaring they the favring sign
with joy beheld and evry heart was cheerd
mounting his car in haste the aged king
drove thro the court and thro the echoing porch
the mules in front by sage idaeus drivn
that drew the fourwheeld wain behind them came
the horses down the citys steep descent
urgd by th old man to speed the crowd of friends
that followd mournd for him as doomd to death
descended from the city to the plain
his sons and sonsinlaw to ilium took
their homeward way advancing oer the plain
they two escapd not joves allseeing eye
pitying he saw the aged sire and thus
at once to hermes spoke his muchlovd son
hermes for thou in social converse lovst
to mix with men and hearst whomeer thou wilt
haste thee and priam to the grecian ships
so lead that none of all the greeks may see
ere at achilles presence he attain

he said nor disobeyd the heavnly guide
his golden sandals on his feet he bound
ambrosial work which bore him oer the waves
swift as the wind and oer the widespread earth
then took his rod wherewith he seals at will
the eyes of men and wakes again from sleep
this in his hand he bore and sprang for flight
soon the wide hellespont he reachd and troy
and passd in likeness of a princely youth
in opning manhood fairest term of life

the twain had passd by ilus lofty tomb
and halted there the horses and the mules
beside the margin of the stream to drink
for darkness now was creeping oer the earth
when through the gloom the herald hermes saw
approaching near to priam thus he cried
o son of dardanus bethink thee well
of prudent counsel great is now our need
a man i see and fear he means us ill
say with the horses shall we fly at once
or clasp his knees and for his mercy sue
the old man heard his mind confusd with dread
so grievously he feard that evry hair
upon his bended limbs did stand on end
he stood astounded but the guardiangod
approachd and took him by the hand and said
where father goest thou thus with horse and mule
in the still night when men are sunk in sleep
and fearst thou not the slaughterbreathing greeks
thine unrelenting foes and they so near
if any one of them should see thee now
so richly laden in the gloom of night
how wouldst thou feel thou art not young thyself
and this old man thy comrade would avail
but little to protect thee from assault
i will not harm thee nay will shield from harm
for like my fathers is methinks thy face

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
tis as thou sayst fair son yet hath some god
extended oer me his protecting hand
who sends me such a guide so opportune
blessd are thy parents in a son so gracd
in face and presence and of mind so wise

to whom in answer thus the guardiangod
o father well and wisely dost thou speak
but tell me this and truly dost thou bear
these wealthy treasures to some foreign land
that they for thee in safety may be stord
or have ye all resolvd to fly from troy
in fear your bravest slain thy gallant son
who never from the greeks encounter flinchd

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
who art thou noble sir and what thy race
that speakst thus fairly of my hapless son

to whom in answer thus the guardiangod
try me old man of godlike hector ask
for often in the glorygiving fight
these eyes have seen him chief when to the ships
the greeks he drove and with the sword destroyd
we gazd in wonder from the fight restraind
by peleus son with agamemnon wroth
his follower i one ship conveyd us both
one of the myrmidons i am my sire
polyctor rich but aged een as thou
six sons he hath besides myself the sevnth
and i by lot was drafted for the war
i from the ships am to the plain come forth
for with the dawn of day the keeneyd greeks
will round the city marshal their array
they chafe in idleness the chiefs in vain
strive to restrain their ardour for the fight

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
if of achilles peleus son thou art
indeed a follower tell me all the truth
lies yet my son beside the grecian ships
or hath achilles torn him limb from limb
and to his dogs the mangled carcase givn

to whom in answer thus the guardiangod
on him old man nor dogs nor birds have fed
but by the ship of peleus son he lies
within the tent twelve days he there hath lain
nor hath corruption touchd his flesh nor worms
that wont to prey on men in battle slain
the corpse indeed with each returning morn
around his comrades tomb achilles drags
yet leaves it still uninjurd thou thyself
mightst see how fresh as dewbesprent he lies
from bloodstains cleansd and closd his many wounds
for many a lance was buried in his corpse
so een in death the blessed gods above
who lovd him well protect thy noble son

he said th old man rejoicing heard his words
and answerd see my son how good it is
to give th immortal gods their tribute due
for never did my son while yet he livd
neglect the gods who on olympus dwell
and thence have they rememberd him in death
accept i pray this goblet richembossd
be thou my guard and under heavn my guide
until i reach the tent of peleus son

to whom in answer thus the guardiangod
old father me thy younger wouldst thou tempt
in vain who biddst me at thy hands accept
thy profferd presents to achilles wrong
i dread his anger and should hold it shame
to plunder him through fear of future ill
but as thy guide i could conduct thee safe
as far as argos journeying by thy side
on shipboard or on foot nor by the fault
of thy conductor shouldst thou meet with harm

thus spoke the guardiangod and on the car
mounting in haste he took the whip and reins
and with fresh vigour mules and horses filld
when to the shiptowrs and the trench they came
the guard had late been busied with their meal
and with deep sleep the heavnly guide oerspread
the eyes of all then opend wide the gates
and pushd aside the bolts and led within
both priam and the treasureladen wain
but when they reachd achilles lofty tent

then for the old man hermes opd the gate
and brought within the court the gifts designd
for peleus godlike son then from the car
sprang to the ground and thus to priam spoke
old man a god hath hither been thy guide
hermes i am and sent to thee from jove
father of all to bring thee safely here
i now return nor to achilles eyes
will i appear beseems it not a god
to greet a mortal in the sight of all
but go thou in and clasp achilles knees
and supplicate him for his fathers sake
his fairhaird mothers and his childs that so
thy words may stir an answer in his heart

thus saying hermes to olympus heights
returnd and priam from his chariot sprang
and left idaeus there in charge to keep
the horses and the mules while he himself
enterd the dwelling straight where wont to sit
achilles lovd of heavn the chief he found
within his followers seated all apart
two only in his presence ministerd
the brave automedon and alcimus
a warrior bold scarce ended the repast
of food and wine the table still was set
great priam enterd unperceivd of all
and standing by achilles with his arms
embracd his knees and kissd those fearful hands
bloodstaind which many of his sons had slain
as when a man by cruel fate pursued
in his own land hath shed anothers blood
and flying seeks beneath some wealthy house
a foreign refuge wondring all behold
on godlike priam so with wonder gazd
achilles wonder seizd th attendants all
and one to other looked then priam thus
to peleus son his suppliant speech addressd
think great achilles rival of the gods
upon thy father een as i myself
upon the threshold of unjoyous age
and haply he from them that dwell around
may suffer wrong with no protector near
to give him aid yet he rejoicing knows
that thou still livst and day by day may hope
to see his son returning safe from troy
while i all hapless that have many sons
the best and bravest through the breadth of troy
begotten deem that none are left me now
fifty there were when came the sons of greece
nineteen the offspring of a single womb
the rest the women of my household bore
of these have many by relentless mars
been laid in dust but he my only one
the citys and his brethrens sole defence
he bravely fighting in his countrys cause
hector but lately by thy hand hath falln
on his behalf i venture to approach
the grecian ships for his release to thee
to make my prayr and priceless ransom pay
then thou achilles reverence the gods
and for thy fathers sake look pitying down
on me more needing pity since i bear
such grief as never man on earth hath borne
who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son

thus as he spoke within achilles breast
fond memry of his father rose he touchd
the old mans hand and gently put him by
then wept they both by various memries stirrd
one prostrate at achilles feet bewaild
his warrior son achilles for his sire
and for patroclus wept his comrade dear
and through the house their weeping loud was heard
but when achilles had indulgd his grief
and easd the yearning of his heart and limbs
uprising with his hand the aged sire
pitying his hoary head and hoary beard
he raisd and thus with gentle words addressd

alas what sorrows poor old man are thine
how couldst thou venture to the grecian ships
alone and to the presence of the man
whose hand hath slain so many of thy sons
many and brave an iron heart is thine
but sit thou on this seat and in our hearts
though filled with grief let us that grief suppress
for woful lamentation nought avails
such is the thread the gods for mortals spin
to live in woe while they from cares are free
two coffers lie beside the door of jove
with gifts for man one good the other ill
to whom from each the lord of lightning gives
him sometimes evil sometimes good befalls
to whom the ill alone him foul disgrace
and grinding misry oer the earth pursue
by god and man alike despisd he roams
thus from his birth the gods to peleus gave
excellent gifts with wealth and substance blessd
above his fellows oer the myrmidons
he ruld with sovreign sway and heavn bestowd
on him a mortal an immortal bride
yet this of ill was mingled in his lot
that in his house no rising race he saw
of future kings one only son he had
one doomd to early death nor is it mine
to tend my fathers age but far from home
thee and thy sons in troy i vex with war
much have we heard too of thy former wealth
above what lesbos northward macars seat
contains and upper phrygia and the shores
of boundless hellespont tis said that thou
in wealth and number of thy sons wast blessd
but since on thee this curse the gods have brought
still round thy city war and murder rage
bear up nor thus with grief incessant mourn
vain is thy sorrow for thy gallant son
thou canst not raise him and mayst suffer more

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
tell me not yet illustrious chief to sit
while hector lies uncard for in the tent
but let me quickly go that with mine eyes
i may behold my son and thou accept
the ample treasures which we tender thee
mayst thou enjoy them and in safety reach
thy native land since thou hast spard my life
and biddst me still behold the light of heavn

to whom achilles thus with stern regard
old man incense me not i mean myself
to give thee back thy son for here of late
despatchd by jove my goddessmother came
the daughter of the aged oceangod
and thee too priam well i know some god
 hath guided to our ships
no mortal though in ventrous youth would dare
our camp to enter nor could hope to pass
unnoticd by the watch nor easily
remove the pondrous bar that guards our doors
but stir not up my anger in my grief
lest suppliant though thou be within my tent
i brook thee not and joves command transgress

he said the old man trembled and obeyd
then to the doorway with a lions spring
achilles rushd not unaccompanied
with him automedon and alcimus
his two attendants of his followers all
next to the lost patroclus bestesteemd
they from the yoke the mules and horses loosd
then led the herald of the old man in
and bade him sit and from the polishd wain
the costly ransom took of hectors head
two robes they left and one wellwoven vest
to clothe the corpse and send with honour home
then to the female slaves he gave command
to wash the body and anoint with oil
apart that priam might not see his son
lest his grievd heart its passion unrestraind
should utter and achilles rousd to wrath
his suppliant slay and joves command transgress
when they had washd the body and with oil
anointed and around it wrappd the robe
and vest achilles lifted up the dead
with his own hands and laid him on the couch
which to the polishd wain his followers raisd
then groaning on his friend by name he calld
forgive patroclus be not wroth with me
if in the realm of darkness thou shouldst hear
that godlike hector to his fathers arms
for no mean ransom i restore whereof
a fitting share for thee i set aside

this said achilles to the tent returnd
on the carvd couch from whence he rose he sat
beside the wall and thus to priam spoke

old man thy son according to thy prayr
is givn thee back upon the couch he lies
thyself shalt see him at the dawn of day
meanwhile the evning meal demands our care
not fairhaird niobe abstaind from food
when in the house her children lay in death
six beauteous daughters and six stalwart sons
the youths apollo with his silver bow
the maids the archerqueen diana slew
with anger filld that niobe presumd
herself with fair latona to compare
her many children with her rivals two
so by the two were all the many slain
nine days in death they lay and none was there
to pay their funral rites for saturns son
had given to all the people hearts of stone
at length th immortal gods entombd the dead
nor yet did niobe when now her grief
had worn itself in tears from food refrain
and now in sipylus amid the rocks
and lonely mountains where the goddess nymphs
that love to dance by achelous stream
tis said were cradled she though turnd to stone
broods oer the wrongs inflicted by the gods
so we too godlike sire the meal may share
and later thou thy noble son mayst mourn
to troy restordwell worthy he thy tears

this said he slaughterd straight a whitefleecd sheep
his comrades then the carcase flayd and dressd
the meat prepard and fastend to the spits
roasted with care and from the fire withdrew
the bread automedon from baskets fair
apportiond out the meat achilles shard
they on the viands set before them fell
the rage of thirst and hunger satisfied
in wonder priam on achilles gazd
his form and stature as a god he seemd
and he too lookd on priam and admird
his venerable face and gracious speech
with mutual pleasure each on other gazd
till godlike priam first addressd his host

dismiss me now illustrious chief to rest
and lie we down in gentle slumbers wrappd
for never have mine eyes been closd in sleep
since by thy hand my gallant son was slain
but groaning still i brood upon my woes
and in my court with dust my head defile
now have i tasted bread now ruddy wine
hath oer my palate passd but not till now

thus he his comrades and th attendant maids
achilles orderd in the corridor
two mattresses to place with blankets fair
of purple wool oerlaid and on the top
rugs and soft sheets for upper covring spread
they from the chamber torch in hand withdrew
and with obedient haste two beds prepard
then thus achilles spoke in jesting tone
thou needs must sleep without my good old friend
lest any leader of the greeks should come
as is their custom to confer with me
of them whoeer should find thee here by night
forthwith to agamemnon would report
and hector might not be so soon restord
but tell me truly this how many days
for godlike hectors funral rites ye need
that for so long a time i may myself
refrain from combat and the people stay

to whom in answer priam godlike sire
if by thy leave we may indeed perform
his funral rites to thee achilles great
will be our gratitude if this thou grant
thou knowst how close the town is hemmd around
and from the mountain distant as it is
the trojans well may fear to draw the wood
nine days to public mourning would we give
the tenth to funral rites and funral feast
then on th eleventh would we raise his mound
the twelfth renew the war if needs we must

to whom achilles swift of foot replied
so shall it be old priam i engage
to stay the battle for the time requird

thus speaking with his hand the old mans wrist
he graspd in token that he need not fear
then in the corridor lay down to rest
old priam and the herald elders sage
while in his tents recess achilles slept
the fair briseis resting by his side

in nightlong slumbers lay the other gods
and helmed chiefs by gentle sleep subdued
but on the eyes of hermes guardiangod
no slumber fell deep pondring in his mind
how from the ships in safety to conduct
the royal priam and the guard elude
above the sleepers head he stood and cried
old man small heed thou takst of coming ill
who when achilles gives thee leave to go
sleepst undisturbd surrounded by thy foes
thy son hath been restord and thou hast paid
a genrous price but to redeem thy life
if agamemnon and the other greeks
should know that thou art here full thrice so much
thy sons who yet are left would have to pay

he said the old man trembled and arousd
the herald while the horses and the mules
were yokd by hermes who with silent speed
drove through th encampment unobservd of all
but when they came to eddying xanthus ford
fairflowing stream born of immortal jove
to high olympus hermes took his flight
as morn in saffron robe oer all the earth
was light diffusing they with funral wail
drove cityward the horses following came
the mules that drew the litter of the dead
the plain they traversd oer observd of none
or man or woman till cassandra fair
as golden venus from the topmost height
of pergamus her father in his car
upstanding saw the herald at his side
him too she saw who on the litter lay
then lifted up her voice and cried aloud
to all the city hither trojans come
both men and women hector see restord
if while he livd returning from the fight
ye met him eer rejoicing who indeed
was all the citys chiefest joy and pride

she said nor man nor woman then was left
within the city oer the minds of all
grief passd resistless to the gates in throngs
they pressd to crowd round him who brought the dead
the first to clasp the body were his wife
and honourd mother eagerly they sprang
on the smoothrolling wain to touch the head
of hector round them weeping stood the crowd
weeping till sunset all the livelong day
had they before the gates for hector mournd
had not old priam from the car addressd
the crowd make way that so the mules may pass
when to my house i shall have brought my dead
ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will

thus as he spoke obedient to his word
they stood aside and for the car made way
but when to priams lordly house they came
they laid him on a richwrought couch and calld
the minstrels in who by the heros bed
should lead the melancholy chorus they
pourd forth the music of the mournful dirge
while womens voices joind in loud lament
whitearmd andromache the wail began
the head of hector clasping in her hands
my husband thou art gone in pride of youth
and in thine house hast left me desolate
thy child an infant still thy child and mine
unhappy parents both nor dare i hope
that he may reach the ripeness of his youth
for ere that day shall troy in ruin fall
since thou art gone her guardian thou whose arm
defended her her wives and helpless babes
they now shall shortly oer the sea be borne
and with them i shall go thou too my child
must follow me to servile labour doomd
the suffring victim of a tyrant lord
unless perchance some angry greek may seize
and dash thee from the towra woful death
whose brother or whose father or whose son
by hector hath been slain for many a greek
by hectors hand hath bit the bloody dust
not light in battle was thy fathers hand
therefore for him the genral city mourns
thou to thy parents bitter grief hast causd
hector but bittrest grief of all hast left
to me for not to me was givn to clasp
the hand extended from thy dying bed
nor words of wisdom catch which night and day
with tears i might have treasurd in my heart

weeping she spokethe women joind the wail
then hecuba took up the loud lament
hector of all my children dearest thou
dear to th immortals too in life wast thou
and they in death have borne thee still in mind
for other of my sons his captives made
across the watry waste to samos isle
or imbros or th inhospitable shore
of lemnos hath achilles swift of foot
to slavry sold thee when his sharpedgd spear
had robbd thee of thy life he draggd indeed
around patroclus tomb his comrade dear
whom thou hadst slain yet so he raisd not up
his dead to life again now liest thou here
all fresh and fair as dewbesprent like one
whom bright apollo with his arrows keen
god of the silver bow hath newly slain

weeping she spoke and rousd the genral grief
then helen third the mournful strain renewd
hector of all my brethren dearest thou
true godlike paris claims me as his wife
who bore me hitherwould i then had died
but twenty years have passd since here i came
and left my native land yet neer from thee
i heard one scornful one degrading word
and when from others i have borne reproach
thy brothers sisters or thy brothers wives
or mother  thou hast checkd them still
with tender feeling and with gentle words
for thee i weep and for myself no less
for through the breadth of troy none love me now
none kindly look on me but all abhor

weeping she spoke and with her wept the crowd
at length the aged priam gave command
haste now ye trojans to the city bring
good store of fuel fear no treachrous wile
for when he sent me from the darkribbd ships
achilles promisd that from hostile arms
till the twelfth morn we should no harm sustain

he said and they the oxen and the mules
yokd to the wains and from the city throngd
nine days they labourd and brought back to troy
good store of wood but when the tenth days light
upon the earth appeard weeping they bore
brave hector out and on the funral pile
laying the glorious dead applied the torch

while yet the rosyfingerd morn was young
round noble hectors pyre the people pressd
when all were gatherd round and closely throngd
first on the burning mass as far as spread
the range of fire they pourd the ruddy wine
and quenchd the flames his brethren then and friends
weeping the hot tears flowing down their cheeks
collected from the pile the whitend bones
these in a golden casket they enclosd
and oer it spread soft shawls of purple dye
then in a grave they laid it and in haste
with stone in pondrous masses coverd oer
and raisd a mound and watchd on evry side
from sudden inroad of the greeks to guard
the mound erected back they turnd and all
assembled duly shard the solemn feast
in priams palace heavndescended king

such were the rites to glorious hector paid




the man for wisdoms various arts renownd
long exercised in woes o muse resound
who when his arms had wrought the destined fall
of sacred troy and razed her heavenbuilt wall
wandering from clime to clime observant strayd
their manners noted and their states surveyd
on stormy seas unnumberd toils he bore
safe with his friends to gain his natal shore
vain toils their impious folly dared to prey
on herds devoted to the god of day
the god vindictive doomd them never more
 to touch that natal shore
oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate
celestial muse and to our world relate

now at their native realms the greeks arrived
all who the wars of ten long years survived
and scaped the perils of the gulfy main
ulysses sole of all the victor train
an exile from his dear paternal coast
deplored his absent queen and empire lost
calypso in her caves constraind his stay
with sweet reluctant amorous delay
in vainfor now the circling years disclose
the day predestined to reward his woes
at length his ithaca is given by fate
where yet new labours his arrival wait
at length their rage the hostile powers restrain
all but the ruthless monarch of the main
but now the god remote a heavenly guest
in æthiopia graced the genial feast

there on the worlds extremest verge revered
with hecatombs and prayer in pomp preferrd
distant he lay while in the bright abodes
of high olympus jove convened the gods
the assembly thus the sire supreme addressd
aegysthus fate revolving in his breast
whom young orestes to the dreary coast
of pluto sent a bloodpolluted ghost

perverse mankind whose wills created free
charge all their woes on absolute degree
all to the dooming gods their guilt translate
and follies are miscalld the crimes of fate
when to his lust aegysthus gave the rein
did fate or we the adulterous act constrain
did fate or we when great atrides died
urge the bold traitor to the regicide
hermes i sent while yet his soul remaind
sincere from royal blood and faith profaned
to warn the wretch that young orestes grown
to manly years should reassert the throne
yet impotent of mind and uncontrolld
he plunged into the gulf which heaven foretold

here paused the god and pensive thus replies
minerva graceful with her azure eyes

o thou from whom the whole creation springs
the source of power on earth derived to kings
his death was equal to the direful deed
so may the man of blood be doomed to bleed
but grief and rage alternate wound my breast
for brave ulysses still by fate oppressd
amidst an isle around whose rocky shore
the forests murmur and the surges roar
the blameless hero from his wishdfor home
a goddess guards in her enchanted dome

by his fair daughter is the chief confined
who soothes to dear delight his anxious mind
successless all her soft caresses prove
to banish from his breast his countrys love
to see the smoke from his loved palace rise
while the dear isle in distant prospect lies
with what contentment could he close his eyes
and will omnipotence neglect to save
the suffering virtue of the wise and brave
must he whose altars on the phrygian shore
with frequent rites and pure avowd thy power
be doomd the worst of human ills to prove
unblessd abandond to the wrath of jove

daughter what words have passd thy lips unweighd

deem not unjustly by my doom oppressd
of human race the wisest and the best
neptune by prayer repentant rarely won
afflicts the chief to avenge his giant son
whose visual orb ulysses robbd of light
great polypheme of more than mortal might
him young thousa bore 
whom neptune eyed with bloom of beauty blessd
and in his cave the yielding nymph compressd
for this the god constrains the greek to roam
a hopeless exile from his native home
from death alone exemptbut cease to mourn
let all combine to achieve his wishd return
neptune atoned his wrath shall now refrain
or thwart the synod of the gods in vain

father and king adored minerva cried
since all who in the olympian bower reside
now make the wandering greek their public care
let hermes to the atlantic isle repair
bid him arrived in bright calypsos court
the sanction of the assembled powers report
that wise ulysses to his native land
must speed obedient to their high command
meantime telemachus the blooming heir
of seagirt ithaca demands my care
tis mine to form his green unpractised years
in sage debates surrounded with his peers
to save the state and timely to restrain
the bold intrusion of the suitortrain
who crowd his palace and with lawless power
his herds and flocks in feastful rites devour
to distant sparta and the spacious waste
of sandy pyle the royal youth shall haste
there warm with filial love the cause inquire
that from his realm retards his godlike sire
delivering early to the voice of fame
the promise of a green immortal name

she said the sandals of celestial mould
fledged with ambrosial plumes and rich with gold
surround her feet with these sublime she sails
the aërial space and mounts the winged gales
oer earth and ocean wide prepared to soar
her dreaded arm a beamy javelin bore
ponderous and vast which when her fury burns
proud tyrants humbles and whole hosts oerturns
from high olympus prone her flight she bends
and in the realms of ithaca descends
her lineaments divine the grave disguise
of mentes form conceald from human eyes

a glittering spear waved awful in her hand
there in the portal placed the heavenborn maid
enormous riot and misrule surveyd
on hides of beeves before the palace gate
 the suitors sate
with rival art and ardour in their mien
at chess they vie to captivate the queen
divining of their loves attending nigh
a menial train the flowing bowl supply
others apart the spacious hall prepare
and form the costly feast with busy care
there young telemachus his bloomy face
glowing celestial sweet with godlike grace
amid the circle shines but hope and fear
 his bosom tear
now imaged in his mind he sees restored
in peace and joy the peoples rightful lord
the proud oppressors fly the vengeful sword
while his fond soul these fancied triumphs swelld
the stranger guest the royal youth beheld
grieved that a visitant so long should wait
unmarkd unhonourd at a monarchs gate
instant he flew with hospitable haste
and the new friend with courteous air embraced
stranger whoeer thou art securely rest
affianced in my faith a ready guest
approach the dome the social banquet share
and then the purpose of thy soul declare

thus affable and mild the prince precedes
and to the dome the unknown celestial leads
the spear receiving from the hand he placed
against a column fair with sculpture graced
where seemly ranged in peaceful order stood
ulysses arms now long disused to blood
he led the goddess to the sovereign seat
her feet supported with a stool of state

then drew his seat familiar to her side
far from the suitortrain a brutal crowd
with insolence and wine elate and loud
where the free guest unnoted might relate
if haply conscious of his fathers fate
the golden ewer a maid obsequious brings
replenishd from the cool translucent springs
with copious water the bright vase supplies
a silver laver of capacious size
they wash the tables in fair order spread
they heap the glittering canisters with bread
viands of various kinds allure the taste
of choicest sort and savour rich repast
delicious wines the attending herald brought
the gold gave lustre to the purple draught
lured with the vapour of the fragrant feast
in rushd the suitors with voracious haste
marshalld in order due to each a sewer
presents to bathe his hands a radiant ewer
luxurious then they feast observant round
gay stripling youths the brimming goblets crownd
the rage of hunger quelld they all advance
and form to measured airs the mazy dance
to phemius was consignd the chorded lyre
whose hand reluctant touchd the warbling wire
phemius whose voice divine could sweetest sing
high strains responsive to the vocal string

meanwhile in whispers to his heavenly guest
his indignation thus the prince expressd

indulge my rising grief whilst these 
with song and dance the pompous revel end
light is the dance and doubly sweet the lays
when for the dear delight another pays
his treasured stores those cormarants consume
whose bones defrauded of a regal tomb
and common turf lie naked on the plain
or doomd to welter in the whelming main
should he return that troop so blithe and bold
with purple robes inwrought and stiff with gold
precipitant in fear would wing their flight
and curse their cumbrous prides unwieldy weight
but ah i dreamthe appointed hour is fled
and hope too long with vain delusion fed
deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame
gives to the roll of death his glorious name
with venial freedom let me now demand
thy name thy lineage and paternal land
sincere from whence began thy course recite
and to what ship i owe the friendly freight
now first to me this visit dost thou deign
or numberd in my fathers social train
all who deserved his choice he made his own
and curious much to know he far was known

my birth i boast 
from great anchialus renownd and wise
mentes my name i rule the taphian race
whose bounds the deep circumfluent waves embrace
a duteous people and industrious isle
to naval arts inured and stormy toil
freighted with iron from my native land
i steer my voyage to the brutian strand
to gain by commerce for the labourd mass
a just proportion of refulgent brass
far from your capital my ship resides
at reitorus and secure at anchor rides
where waving groves on airy neign grow
supremely tall and shade the deeps below
thence to revisit your imperial dome
an old hereditary guest i come
your fathers friend laertes can relate
our faith unspotted and its early date
who pressd with heartcorroding grief and years
to the gay court a rural shed prefers
where sole of all his train a matron sage
supports with homely fond his drooping age
with feeble steps from marshalling his vines
returning sad when toilsome day declines

with friendly speed induced by erring fame
to hail ulysses safe return i came
but still the frown of some celestial power
with envious joy retards the blissful hour
let not your soul be sunk in sad despair
he lives he breathes this heavenly vital air
among a savage race whose shelfy bounds
with ceaseless roar the foaming deep surrounds
the thoughts which roll within my ravishd breast
to me no seer the inspiring gods suggest
nor skilld nor studious with prophetic eye
to judge the winged omens of the sky
yet hear this certain speech nor deem it vain
though adamantine bonds the chief restrain
the dire restraint his wisdom will defeat
and soon restore him to his regal seat
but generous youth sincere and free declare
are you of manly growth his royal heir
for sure ulysses in your look appears
the same his features if the same his years
such was that face on which i dwelt with joy
ere greece assembled stemmd the tides to troy
but parting then for that detested shore
our eyes unhappy never greeted more

to prove a genuine birth 
on female truth assenting faith relies
thus manifest of right i build my claim
surefounded on a fair maternal fame
ulysses son but happier he whom fate
hath placed beneath the storms which toss the great
happier the son whose hoary sire is blessd
with humble affluence and domestic rest
happier than i to future empire born
but doomd a fathers wretchd fate to mourn

to whom with aspect mild the guest divine
oh true descendant of a sceptred line
the gods a glorious fate from anguish free
to chaste penelopes increase decree
but say yon jovial troops so gaily dressd
is this a bridal or a friendly feast
or from their deed i rightlier may divine
unseemly flown with insolence and wine
unwelcome revellers whose lawless joy
pains the sage ear and hurts the sober eye

magnificence of old 
beneath our roof with virtue could reside
unblamed abundance crowned the royal board
what time this dome revered her prudent lord
who now  is doomd to mourn
bitter constraint erroneous and forlorn
better the chief on ilions hostile plain
had falln surrounded with his warlike train
or safe returnd the race of glory passd
new to his friends embrace and breathed his last
then grateful greece with streaming eyes would raise
historic marbles to record his praise
his praise eternal on the faithful stone
had with transmissive honour graced his son
now snatchd by harpies to the dreary coast
sunk is the hero and his glory lost
vanishd at once unheard of and unknown
and i his heir in misery alone
nor for a dear lost father only flow
the filial tears but woe succeeds to woe
to tempt the spouseless queen with amorous wiles
resort the nobles from the neighbouring isles
from samos circled with the ionian main
dulichium and zacynthas sylvan reign
evn with presumptuous hope her bed to ascend
the lords of ithaca their right pretend
she seems attentive to their pleaded vows
her heart detesting what her ear allows
they vain expectants of the bridal hour
my stores in riotous expense devour
in feast and dance the mirthful months employ
and meditate my doom to crown their joy

with tender pity touchd the goddess cried
soon may kind heaven a sure relief provide
soon may your sire discharge the vengeance due
and all your wrongs the proud oppressors rue
oh in that portal should the chief appear
each hand tremendous with a brazen spear
in radiant panoply his limbs incased

he then from ephyre the fair domain
of ilus sprung from jasons royal strain
measured a length of seas a toilsome length in vain
for voyaging to learn the direful art
to taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart
observant of the gods and sternly just
ilus refused to impart the baneful trust
with friendlier zeal my fathers soul was fired
the drugs he knew and gave the boon desired
appeard he now with such heroic port
as then conspicuous at the taphian court
soon should yon boasters cease their haughty strife
or each atone his guilty love with life
but of his wishd return the care resign
be future vengeance to the powers divine
my sentence hear with stern distaste avowd
to their own districts drive the suitorcrowd
when next the morning warms the purple east
convoke the peerage and the gods attest
the sorrows of your inmost soul relate
and form sure plans to save the sinking state
should second love a pleasing flame inspire
and the chaste queen connubial rights require
dismissd with honour let her hence repair
to great icarius whose paternal care
will guide her passion and reward her choice
with wealthy dower and bridal gifts of price
then let this dictate of my love prevail
instant to foreign realms prepare to sail
to learn your fathers fortunes fame may prove
or omend voice 
propitious to the search direct your toil
through the wide ocean first to sandy pyle
of nestor hoary sage his doom demand
thence speed your voyage to the spartan strand
for young atrides to the achaian coast
arrived the last of all the victor host
if yet ulysses views the light forbear
till the fleet hours restore the circling year
but if his soul hath wingd the destined flight
inhabitant of deep disastrous night
homeward with pious speed repass the main
to the pale shade funereal rites ordain
plant the fair column oer the vacant grave
a heros honours let the hero have
with decent grief the royal dead deplored
for the chaste queen select an equal lord
then let revenge your daring mind employ
by fraud or force the suitor train destroy
and starting into manhood scorn the boy
hast thou not heard how young orestes fired
with great revenge immortal praise acquired
his virginsword aegysthus veins imbrued
the murderer fell and blood atoned for blood
o greatly blessd with every blooming grace
with equal steps the paths of glory trace
join to that royal youths your rival name
and shine eternal in the sphere of fame
but my associates now my stay deplore
impatient on the hoarseresounding shore
thou heedful of advice secure proceed
my praise the precept is be thine the deed

the counsel of my friend 
imprints conviction on my grateful mind
so fathers speak 
their sage experience to the favourite child
but since to part for sweet refection due
the genial viands let my train renew
and the rich pledge of plighted faith receive
worthy the heir of ithaca to give

defer the promised boon 
and let me now regain the reithrian port
from temese returnd your royal court
i shall revisit and that pledge receive
and gifts memorial of our friendship leave

abrupt with eaglespeed she cut the sky
instant invisible to mortal eye
then first he recognized the ethereal guest
wonder and joy alternate fire his breast
heroic thoughts infused his heart dilate
revolving much his fathers doubtful fate
at length composed he joind the suitorthrong
hushd in attention to the warbled song
his tender theme the charming lyrist chose
minervas anger and the dreadful woes
which voyaging from troy the victors bore
while storms vindictive intercept the store
the shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds
reflecting to the queen the silver sounds
with grief renewd the weeping fair descends
their sovereigns step a virgin train attends
a veil of richest texture wrought she wears
and silent to the joyous hall repairs
there from the portal with her mild command
thus gently checks the minstrels tuneful hand

phemius let acts of gods and heroes old
what ancient bards in hall and bower have told
attemperd to the lyre your voice employ
such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy
but oh forbear that dear disastrous name
to sorrow sacred and secure of fame
my bleeding bosom sickens at the sound
and every piercing note inflicts a wound

why dearest object of my duteous love
 will you the bard reprove
oft joves ethereal rays 
the chanters soul and raptured song inspire
instinct divine nor blame severe his choice
warbling the grecian woes with heart and voice
for novel lays attract our ravishd ears
but old the mind with inattention hears
patient permit the sadly pleasing strain
familiar now with grief your tears refrain
and in the public woe forget your own
you weep not for a perishd lord alone
what greeks new wandering in the stygian gloom
wish your ulysses shared an equal doom
your widowd hours apart with female toil
and various labours of the loom beguile
there rule from palacecares remote and free
that care to man belongs and most to me

mature beyond his years the queen admires
his sage reply and with her train retires
then swelling sorrows burst their former bounds
with echoing grief afresh the dome resounds
till pallas piteous of her plaintive cries
in slumber closed her silverstreaming eyes

meantime rekindled at the royal charms
tumultuous love each beating bosom warms
intemperate rage a wordy war began
but bold telemachus assumed the man
instant  your female discord end
ye deedless boasters and the song attend
obey that sweet compulsion nor profane
with dissonance the smooth melodious strain
pacific now prolong the jovial feast
but when the dawn reveals the rosy east
i to the peers assembled shall propose
the firm resolve i here in few disclose
no longer live the cankers of my court
all to your several states with speed resort
waste in wild riot what your land allows
there ply the early feast and late carouse
but if to honour lost tis still decreed
for you my bowl shall flow my flock shall bleed
judge and revenge my right impartial jove
by him and all the immortal thrones above
 each proud oppressor slain
shall with inglorious gore this marble stain

awed by the prince thus haughty bold and young
rage gnawd the lip and wonder chaind the tongue
silence at length the gay antinous broke
constraind a smile and thus ambiguous spoke
what god to your untutord youth affords
this headlong torrent of amazing words
may jove delay thy reign and cumber late
so bright a genius with the toils of state

those toils 
have charms with all their weight tallure the wise
fast by the throne obsequious fame resides
and wealth incessant rolls her golden tides
nor let antinous rage if strong desire
of wealth and fame a youthful bosom fire
elect by jove his delegate of sway
with joyous pride the summons id obey
wheneer ulysses roams the realm of night
should factious power dispute my lineal right
some other greeks a fairer claim may plead
to your pretence their title would precede
at least the sceptre lost i still should reign
sole oer my vassals and domestic train

to this eurymachus to heaven alone
refer the choice to fill the vacant throne
your patrimonial stores in peace possess
undoubted all your filial claim confess
your private right should impious power invade
the peers of ithaca would arm in aid
but say that stranger guest who late withdrew
what and from whence his name and lineage shew
his grave demeanour and majestic grace
speak him descended of no vulgar race
did he some loan of ancient right require
or came forerunner of your sceptrd sire

oh son of polybus the prince replies
no more my sire will glad these longing eyes
the queens fond hope inventive rumour cheers
or vain diviners dreams divert her fears
that strangerguest the taphian realm obeys
a realm defended with encircling seas
mentes an everhonourd name of old
high in ulysses social list enrolld

thus he though conscious of the ethereal guest
answerd evasive of the sly request
meantime the lyre rejoins the sprightly lay
lovedittied airs and dance conclude the day
but when the star of eve with golden light
adornd the matron brow of sable night
the mirthful train dispersing quit the court
and to their several domes to rest resort
a towering structure to the palace joind
to this his steps the thoughtful prince inclined
in his pavilion there to sleep repairs
the lighted torch the sage euryclea bears

whilst to his couch himself the prince addressd
the duteous dame received the purple vest
the purple vest with decent care disposed
the silver ring she pulld the door reclosed
the bolt obedient to the silken cord
to the strong staples inmost depth restored
secured the valves there wrapped in silent shade
pensive the rules the goddess gave he weighd
stretchd on the downy fleece no rest he knows
and in his raptured soul the vision glows





now reddening from the dawn the morning ray
glowd in the front of heaven and gave the day
the youthful hero with returning light
rose anxious from the inquietudes of night
a royal robe he wore with graceful pride
a twoedged falchion threatend by his side
embroiderd sandals glitterd as he trod
and forth he moved majestic as a god
then by his heralds restless of delay
to council calls the peers the peers obey
soon as in solemn form the assembly sate
from his high dome himself descends in state
bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined
two dogs a faithful guard attend behind
pallas with grace divine his form improves
and gazing crowds admire him as he moves

his fathers throne he filld while distant stood
the hoary peers and aged wisdom bowd

twas silence all at last aegyptius spoke
aegyptius by his age and sorrow broke
a length of days his soul with prudence crownd
a length of days had bent him to the ground
his eldest hope in arms to ilion came
by great ulysses taught the path to fame
but  the hideous cyclops tore
his quivering limbs and quaffd his spouting gore
three sons remaind to climb with haughty fires
the royal bed eurynomus aspires
the rest with duteous love his griefs assuage
and ease the sire of half the cares of age
yet still his antiphus he loves he mourns
and as he stood he spoke and wept by turns

since great ulysses sought the phrygian plains
within these walls inglorious silence reigns
say then ye peers by whose commands we meet
why here once more in solemn council sit
ye young ye old the weighty cause disclose
arrives some message of invading foes
or say does high necessity of state
inspire some patriot and demand debate
the present synod speaks its author wise
assist him jove thou regent of the skies

he spoke telemachus with transport glows
embraced the omen and majestic rose

then thus addressing to aegyptius said

reverend old man lo here confessd he stands
by whom ye meet my grief your care demands
no story i unfold of public woes
nor bear advices of impending foes
peace the blest land and joys incessant crown
of all this happy realm i grieve alone
for my lost sire continual sorrows spring
the great the good your father and your king
yet more our house from its foundation bows
our foes are powerful and your sons the foes
hither unwelcome to the queen they come
why seek they not the rich icarian dome
if she must wed from other hands require
the dowry is telemachus her sire
yet through my court the noise of revel rings
and waste the wise frugality of kings
scarce all my herds their luxury suffice
scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies
safe in my youth in riot still they grow
nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe
but come it will the time when manhood grants
more powerful advocates than vain complaints
approach that hour insufferable wrong
cries to the gods and vengeance sleeps too long
rise then ye peers with virtuous anger rise
your fame revere but most the avenging skies
by all the deathless powers that reign above
by righteous themis and by thundering jove

rise in my aid suffice the tears that flow
for my lost sire nor add new woe to woe
if eer he bore the sword to strengthen ill
or having power to wrong betrayd the will
on me on me your kindled wrath assuage
and bid the voice of lawless riot rage
if ruin to your royal race ye doom
be you the spoilers and our wealth consume
then might we hope redress from juster laws
and raise all ithaca to aid our cause
but while your sons commit the unpunishd wrong
you make the arm of violence too strong

while thus he spoke with rage and grief he frownd
and dashd the imperial sceptre to the ground
the big round tear hung trembling in his eye
the synod grieved and gave a pitying sigh
then silent sateat length antinous burns
with haughty rage and sternly thus returns

o insolence of youth whose tongue affords
such railing eloquence and war of words
studious thy countrys worthies to defame
thy erring voice displays thy mothers shame
elusive of the bridal day she gives
fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives
did not the sun through heavens wide azure rolld
for three long years the royal fraud behold
while she laborious in delusion spread
the spacious loom and mixd the various thread
where as to life the wondrous figures rise
thus spoke the inventive queen with artful sighs

though cold in death ulysses breathes no more
cease yet awhile to urge the bridal hour
cease till to great laertes i bequeath
a task of grief his ornaments of death
lest when the fates his royal ashes claim
the grecian matrons taint my spotless fame
when he whom living mighty realms obeyd
shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade

thus she at once the generous train complies
nor fraud mistrusts in virtues fair disguise
the work she plied but studious of delay
by night reversed the labours of the day
while thrice the sun his annual journey made
the conscious lamp the midnight fraud surveyd
unheard unseen three years her arts prevail
the fourth her maid unfolds the amazing tale
we saw as unperceived we took our stand
the backward labours of her faithless hand
then urged she perfects her illustrious toils
a wondrous monument of female wiles

but you o peers and thou o prince give ear

dismiss the queen and if her sire approves
let him espouse her to the peer she loves
bid instant to prepare the bridal train
nor let a race of princes wait in vain
though with a grace divine her soul is blest
and all minerva breathes within her breast
in wondrous arts than woman more renownd
and more than woman with deep wisdom crownd
though tyro nor mycene match her name
not great alcmena 
yet thus by heaven adornd by heavens decree
she shines with fatal excellence to thee
with thee the bowl we drain indulge the feast
till righteous heaven reclaim her stubborn breast
what though from pole to pole resounds her name
the sons destruction waits the mothers fame
for till she leaves thy court it is decreed
thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed

while yet he speaks telemachus replies
evn nature starts and what ye ask denies
thus shall i thus repay a mothers cares
who gave me life and nursed my infant years
while sad on foreign shores ulysses treads
or glides a ghost with unapparent shades
how to icarius in the bridal hour
shall i by waste undone refund the dower
how from my father should i vengeance dread
how would my mother curse my hated head
and while in wrath to vengeful fiends she cries
how from their hell would vengeful fiends arise
abhorrd by all accursed my name would grow
the earths disgrace and humankind my foe
if this displease why urge ye here your stay
haste from the court ye spoilers haste away
waste in wild riot what your land allows
there ply the early feast and late carouse
but if to honour lost tis still decreed
for you my bowl shall flow my flocks shall bleed
judge and assert my right impartial jove
by him and all the immortal host above
 if heaven the power supply
vengeance i vow and for your wrongs ye die

with that two eagles from a mountains height
by joves command direct their rapid flight
swift they descend with wing to wing conjoind
stretch their broad plumes and float upon the wind
above the assembled peers they wheel on high
and clang their wings and hovering beat the sky
with ardent eyes the rival train they threat
and shrieking loud denounce approaching fate
they cuff they tear their cheeks and neck they rend
and from their plumes huge drops of blood descend
then sailing oer the domes and towers they fly
full toward the east and mount into the sky

the wondering rivals gaze with cares oppressd
and chilling horrors freeze in every breast
till big with knowledge of approaching woes
the prince of augurs halitherses rose
prescient he viewd the aërial tracks and drew
a sure presage from every wing that flew

ye sons  of ithaca give ear
hear all but chiefly you o rivals hear
destruction sure oer all your heads impends
ulysses comes and death his steps attends
nor to the great alone is death decreed
we and our guilty ithaca must bleed
why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay
be humbled all and lead ye great the way
for lo my words no fancied woes relate
i speak from science and the voice of fate

when great ulysses sought the phrygian shores
to shake with war proud ilions lofty towers
deeds then undone my faithful tongue foretold
heaven seald my words and you those deeds behold
i see  his woes a countless train
i see his friends oerwhelmd beneath the main
how twice ten years from shore to shore he roams
now twice ten years are past and now he comes

to whom eurymachusfly dotard fly
with thy wise dreams and fables of the sky
go prophesy at home thy sons advise
here thou art sage in vaini better read the skies
unnumberd birds glide through the aërial way
vagrants of air and unforeboding stray
cold in the tomb or in the deeps below
ulysses lies oh wert thou laid as low
then would that busy head no broils suggest
for fire to rage telemachus breast
from him some bribe thy venal tongue requires
and interest not the god thy voice inspires
his guideless youth if thy experienced age
mislead fallacious into idle rage
vengeance deserved thy malice shall repress
and but augment the wrongs thou wouldst redress
telemachus may bid the queen repair
to great icarius whose paternal care
will guide her passion and reward her choice
with wealthy dower and bridal gifts of price
till she retires determined we remain
and both the prince and augur threat in vain
his pride of words and thy wild dream of fate
move not the brave or only move their hate
threat on o prince elude the bridal day
threat on till all thy stores in waste decay
true greece affords a train of lovely dames
in wealth and beauty worthy of our flames
but never from this nobler suit we cease
for wealth and beauty less than virtue please

to whom the youth since then in vain i tell
my numerous woes in silence let them dwell
but heaven and all the greeks have heard my wrongs
to heaven and all the greeks redress belongs
yet this i ask 
a bark to waft me oer the rolling main
the realms of pyle and sparta to explore
and seek my royal sire from shore to shore
if or to fame his doubtful fate be known
or to be learnd from oracles alone
if yet he lives with patience i forbear
till the fleet hours restore the circling year
but if already wandering in the train
of empty shades i measure back the main
plant the fair column oer the mighty dead
and yield his consort to the nuptial bed

he ceased and while abashd the peers attend
mentor arose ulysses faithful friend
 my palace be thy care
years rolld on years my godlike sire decay
guard thou his age and his behests obey
stern as he rose he cast his eyes around
that flashd with rage and as spoke he frownd

o never never more let king be just
be mild in power or faithful to his trust
let tyrants govern with an iron rod
oppress destroy and be the scourge of god
since he who like a father held his reign
so soon forgot was just and mild in vain
true while my friend is grieved his griefs i share
yet now the rivals are my smallest care
they for the mighty mischiefs they devise
ere long shall paytheir forfeit lives the price
but against you ye greeks ye coward train
gods how my soul is moved with just disdain
dumb ye all stand and not one tongue affords
his injured prince the little aid of words

while yet he spoke leocritus rejoined
o pride of words and arrogance of mind
wouldst thou to rise in arms the greeks advise
join all your powers in arms ye greeks arise
yet would your powers in vain our strength oppose
the valiant few oermatch a host of foes
should great ulysses stern appear in arms
while the bowl circles and the banquet warms
though to his breast his spouse with transport flies
torn from her breast that hour ulysses dies
but hence retreating to your domes repair
to arm the vessel mentor be thy care
and halitherses thine be each his friend
ye loved the father go the son attend
but yet i trust the boaster means to stay
safe in the court nor tempt the watery way

then with a rushing sound the assembly bend
diverse their steps the rival rout ascend
the royal dome while sad the prince explores
the neighbouring main and sorrowing treads the shores
there as the waters oer his hands he shed
the royal suppliant to minerva prayd

o goddess who descending from the skies
vouchsafed thy presence to my wondering eyes
by whose commands the raging deeps i trace
and seek my sire through storms and rolling seas
hear from thy heavens above o warrior maid
descend once more propitious to my aid
without thy presence vain is thy command
greece and the rival train thy voice withstand

indulgent to his prayer the goddess took
sage mentors form and thus like mentor spoke

o prince in early youth divinely wise
born the ulysses of thy age to rise
if to the son the fathers worth descends
oer the wide wave success thy ways attends
to tread the walks of death he stood prepared
and what he greatly thought he nobly dared
were not wise sons descendant of the wise
and did not heroes from brave heroes rise
vain were my hopes few sons attain the praise
of their great sires and most their sires disgrace
but since thy veins paternal virtue fires
and all penelope thy soul inspires
go and succeed the rivals aims despise
for never never wicked man was wise
blind they rejoice though now evn now they fall
death hastes amain one hour oerwhelms them all
and lo with speed we plough the watery way
my power shall guard thee and my hand convey
the winged vessel studious i prepare
through seas and realms companion of thy care
thou to the court ascend and to the shores
 bear the naval stores
bread that decaying man with strength supplies
and generous wine which thoughtful sorrow flies
meanwhile the mariners by my command
shall speed aboard a valiant chosen band
wide oer the bay by vessel vessel rides
the best i choose to waft then oer the tides

she spoke to his high dome the prince returns
and as he moves with royal anguish mourns
twas riot all among the lawless train
boar bled by boar and goat by goat lay slain
arrived his hand the gay antinous pressd
and thus deriding with a smile addressd

grieve not o daring prince that noble heart
ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part
indulge the genial hour unbend thy soul
leave thought to age and drain the flowing bowl
studious to ease thy grief our care provides
the bark to waft thee oer the swelling tides

is this  for mirth a time
when lawless gluttons riot mirths a crime
the luscious wines dishonourd lose their taste
the song is noise and impious is the feast
suffice it to have spent with swift decay
the wealth of kings and made my youth a prey
but now the wise instructions of the sage
and manly thoughts inspired by manly age
teach me to seek redress for all my woe
here or in pylein pyle or here your foe
deny your vessels ye deny in vain
a private voyager i pass the main
free breathe the winds and free the billows flow
and where on earth i live i live your foe

he spoke and frownd nor longer deignd to stay
sternly his hand withdrew and strode away

meantime oer all the dome they quaff they feast
derisive taunts were spread from guest to guest
and each in jovial mood his mate addressd

tremble ye not o friends and coward fly
doomd by the stern telemachus to die
to pyle or sparta to demand supplies
big with revenge the mighty warrior flies
or comes from ephyre with poisons fraught
and kills us all in one tremendous draught

or who can say 
but while the danger of the deeps he tries
he like his sire may sink deprived of breath
and punish us unkindly by his death
what mighty labours would he then create
to seize his treasures and divide his state
the royal palace to the queen convey
or him she blesses in the bridal day

meantime the lofty rooms the prince surveys
where lay the treasures of the ithacian race
here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed
there polished chests embroiderd vestures graced
here jars of oil breathed forth a rich perfume
there casks of wine in rows adornd the dome

untouchd they stood till his long labours oer
the great ulysses reachd his native shore
a double strength of bars secured the gates
fast by the door the wise euryclea waits
euryclea who great ops thy lineage shared
and watchd all night all day a faithful guard

to whom the prince o thou whose guardian care
nursed the most wretched king that breathes the air
untouchd and sacred may these vessels stand
till great ulysses views his native land
but by thy care twelve urns of wine be filld
next these in worth and firm these urns be seald
and twice ten measures of the choicest flour
prepared ere yet descends the evening hour
for when the favouring shades of night arise
and peaceful slumbers close my mothers eyes
me from our coast shall spreading sails convey
to seek ulysses through the watery way

while yet he spoke she filld the walls with cries
and tears ran trickling from her aged eyes
o whither whither flies my son 
to realms that rocks and roaring seas divide
in foreign lands thy fathers days decayd
and foreign lands contain the mighty dead
the watery way illfated if thou try
all all must perish and by fraud you die
then stay my child storms beat and rolls the main
oh beat those storms and roll the seas in vain

far hence  thy fears be driven
heaven calls me forth these counsels are of heaven
but by the powers that hate the perjured swear
to keep my voyage from the royal ear
nor uncompelld the dangerous truth betray
till twice six times descends the lamp of day
lest the sad tale a mothers life impair
and grief destroy what time awhile would spare

thus he the matron with uplifted eyes
attests the allseeing sovereign of the skies
then studious she prepares the choicest flour
the strength of wheat and wines an ample store
while to the rival train the prince returns
the martial goddess with impatience burns
like thee telemachus in voice and size
with speed divine from street to street she flies
she bids the mariners prepared to stand
when night descends embodied on the strand
then to noëmon swift she runs she flies
and asks a bark the chief a bark supplies

and now declining with his sloping wheels
down sunk the sun behind the western hills
the goddess shoved the vessel from the shores
and stowd within its womb the naval stores
full in the openings of the spacious main
it rides and now descends the sailortrain

next to the court impatient of delay
with rapid step the goddess urged her way
there every eye with slumberous chains she bound
and dashd the flowing goblet to the ground
drowsy they rose with heavy fumes oppressd
reeld from the palace and retired to rest
then thus in mentors reverend form arrayd
spoke to telemachus the martial maid
lo on the seas prepared the vessel stands
the impatient mariner thy speed demands
swift as she spoke with rapid pace she leads
the footsteps of the deity he treads
swift to the shore they move along the strand
the ready vessel rides the sailors ready stand

he bids them bring their stores the attending train
load the tall bark and launch into the main
the prince and goddess to the stern ascend
to the strong stroke at once the rowers bend
full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow
the sable billows foam and roar below
the chief his orders gives the obedient band
with due observance wait the chiefs command
with speed the mast they rear with speed unbind
the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
high oer the roaring waves the spreading sails
bow the tall mast and swell before the gales
the crooked keel the parting surge divides
and to the stern retreating roll the tides
and now they ship their oars and crown with wine
the holy goblet to the powers divine
imploring all the gods that reign above
but chief the blueeyed progeny of jove

thus all the night they stem the liquid way
and end their voyage with the morning ray







the sacred sun above the waters raised
through heavens eternal brazen portals blazed
and wide oer earth diffused his cheering ray
to gods and men to give the golden day
now on the coast of pyle the vessel falls
before old neleus venerable walls
there suppliant to the monarch of the flood
at nine green theatres the pylians stood
each held five hundred 
at each nine oxen on the sand lay slain
they taste the entrails and the altars load
with smoking thighs an offering to the god
full for the port the ithacensians stand
and furl their sails and issue on the land
telemachus already pressd the shore
not first the power of wisdom marchd before
and ere the sacrificing throng he joind
admonishd thus his wellattending mind

proceed my son this youthful shame expel
an honest business never blush to tell
to learn what fates thy wretched sire detain
we passd the wide immeasurable main
meet then the senior far renownd for sense
with reverend awe but decent confidence
urge him with truth to frame his fair replies
and sure he will for wisdom never lies

oh tell me mentor tell me faithful guide

how shall i meet or how accost the sage
unskilld in speech nor yet mature of age
awful thapproach and hard the task appears
to question wisely men of riper years

to whom the martial goddess thus rejoind
search for some thoughts thy own suggesting mind
and others dictated by heavenly power
shall rise spontaneous in the needful hour
for nought unprosperous shall thy ways attend
born with good omens and with heaven thy friend

she spoke and led the way with swiftest speed
as swift the youth pursued the way she led
and joind the band before the sacred fire
where sate encompassd with his sons the sire
the youth of pylos some on pointed wood
transfixd the fragments some prepared the food
in friendly throngs they gather to embrace
their unknown guests and at the banquet place
pisistratus was first to grasp their hands
and spread soft hides upon the yellow sands
along the shore the illustrious pair he led
where nestor sate with youthful thrasymed
to each a portion of the feast he bore
and held the golden goblet foaming oer
then first approaching to the elder guest
the latent goddess in these words addressd
whoeer thou art whom fortune brings to keep
these rites of neptune monarch of the deep
thee first it fits o stranger to prepare
the due libation and the solemn prayer
then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine
though much thy younger and his years like mine
he too i deem implores the power divine
for all mankind alike require their grace
all born to want a miserable race
he spake and to her hand preferrd the bowl
a secret pleasure touchd athenas soul
to see the preference due to sacred age
regarded ever by the just and sage
of oceans king she then implores the grace
o thou whose arms this ample globe embrace
fulfil our wish and let thy glory shine
on nestor first and nestors royal line
next grant the pylian states their just desires
pleased with their hecatombs ascending fires
last deign telemachus and me to bless
and crown our voyage with desired success

thus she and having paid the rite divine
gave to ulysses son the rosy wine
suppliant he prayd and now the victims dressd
they draw divide and celebrate the feast
the banquet done the narrative old man
thus mild the pleasing conference began

now gentle guests the genial banquet oer
it fits to ask ye what your native shore
and whence your race on what adventure say
thus far you wander through the watery way
relate if business or the thirst of gain
engage your journey oer the pathless main
where savage pirates seek through seas unknown
the lives of others venturous of their own

urged by the precepts by the goddess given
and filld with confidence infused from heaven
the youth whom pallas destined to be wise
and famed among the sons of men replies
inquirst thou father from what coast we came

from where high ithaca oerlooks the floods
brown with oerarching shades and pendent woods
us to these shores our filial duty draws
a private sorrow not a public cause
my sire i seek whereer the voice of fame
has told the glories of his noble name
the great ulysses famed from shore to shore
for valour much for hardy suffering more
long time with thee before proud ilions wall
in arms he fought with thee beheld her fall
of all the chiefs this heros fate alone
has jove reserved unheard of and unknown
whether in fields by hostile fury slain
or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main
of this to learn oppressd with tender fears
lo at thy knee his suppliant son appears
if or thy certain eye or curious ear
have learnt his fate the whole dark story clear
and oh whateer heaven destined to betide
let neither flattery soothe nor pity hide
prepared i stand he was but born to try
the lot of man to suffer and to die
oh then if ever through the ten years war
the wise the good ulysses claimd thy care
if eer he joind thy council or thy sword
true in his deed and constant to his word
far as thy mind through backward time can see
search all thy stores of faithful memory
tis sacred truth i ask and ask of thee

to him experienced nestor thus rejoind
o friend what sorrows dost thou bring to mind
shall i the long laborious scene review
and open all the wounds of greece anew
what toils by sea where dark in quest of prey
dauntless we roved achilles led the way
what toils by land where mixd in fatal fight
such numbers fell such heroes sunk to night
there ajax great achilles there the brave
there wise patroclus fill an early grave
there too my sonah once my best delight
once swift of foot and terrible in fight
in whom stern courage with soft virtue joind
a faultless body and a blameless mind
antilochuswhat more can i relate
how trace the tedious series of our fate
not added years on years my task could close
the long historian of my countrys woes
back to thy native islands mightst thou sail
and leave halfheard the melancholy tale
nine painful years on that detested shore
what stratagems we formd what toils we bore
still labouring on till scarce at last we found
great jove propitious and our conquest crownd
far oer the rest thy mighty father shined
in wit in prudence and in force of mind
art thou the son of that illustrious sire
with joy i grasp thee and with love admire
so like your voices and your words so wise
who finds thee younger must consult his eyes
thy sire and i were one nor varied aught
in public sentence or in private thought
alike to council or the assembly came
with equal souls and sentiments the same
but when  proud ilion burnd
and in their ships the conquering greeks returnd
twas gods high will the victors to divide
and turn the event confounding human pride
some he destroyd some scatterd as the dust

then discord sent by pallas from above
stern daughter of the great avenger jove
the brotherkings inspired with fell debate
who calld to council all the achaian state
but calld untimely 
sour with debauch a reeling tribe they came
to these the cause of meeting they explain
and menelaus moves to cross the main
not so the king of men he willd to stay
the sacred rites and hecatombs to pay
and calm minervas wrath oh blind to fate
the gods not lightly change their love or hate
with ireful taunts each other they oppose
till in loud tumult all the greeks arose
now different counsels every breast divide
each burns with rancour to the adverse side
the unquiet night strange projects entertaind

we with the rising morn our ships unmoord
and brought our captives and our stores aboard
but half the people with respect obeyd
the king of men and at his bidding stayd
now on the wings of winds our course we keep

for tenedos we spread our eager oars
there land and pay due victims to the powers
to bless our safe return we join in prayer
but angry jove dispersed our vows in air
and raised new discord then 
ulysses first and nestor disagreed
wise as he was by various counsels swayd
he there though late to please the monarch stayd
but i determined stem the foamy floods
warnd of the coming fury of the gods
with us tydides feard and urged his haste
and menelaus came but came the last
he joind our vessels in the lesbian bay
while yet we doubted of our watery way
if to the right to urge the pilots toil
 beside the psyrian isle
or the straight course to rocky chios plough
and anchor under mimas shaggy brow
we sought direction of the power divine
the god propitious gave the guiding sign
through the mid seas he bid our navy steer
and in euboea shun the woes we fear
the whistling winds already waked the sky
before the whistling winds the vessels fly
with rapid swiftness cut the liquid way
and reach gerestus at the point of day
there hecatombs of bulls to neptune slain
highflaming please the monarch of the main
the fourth day shone when all their labours oer
tydides vessels touched the wishdfor shore
but i to pylos scud before the gales
the god still breathing on my swelling sails
separate from all i safely landed here
their fates or fortunes never reachd my ear
yet what i learnd attend as here i sat
and askd each voyager each heros fate
curious to know and willing to relate

safe reachd the myrmidons their native land
beneath achilles warlike sons command
those whom the heir of great apollos art
brave philoctetes taught to wing the dart
and those whom idomen from ilions plain
had led securely crossd the dreadful main
how agamemnon touchd his argive coast
and how his life by fraud and force he lost
and how the murderer paid his forfeit breath
what lands so distant from that scene of death
but trembling heard the fame and heard admire
how well the son appeased his slaughterd sire
evn to the unhappy that unjustly bleed
heaven gives posterity to avenge the deed
so fell ægysthus and mayest thou my friend

make future times thy equal act adore
and be what brave orestes was before

the prudent youth replied o thou the grace
and lasting glory of the grecian race
just was the vengeance and to latest days
shall long posterity resound the praise
some god this arm with equal prowess bless
and the proud suitors shall its force confess
injurious men who while my soul is sore
of fresh affronts are meditating more
but heaven denies this honour to my hand
nor shall my father repossess the land
the fathers fortune never to return
and the sad sons to softer and to mourn
thus he and nestor took the word my son
is it then true as distant rumours run
that crowds of rivals for thy mothers charms
thy palace fill with insults and alarms
say is the fault through tame submission thine
or leagued against thee do thy people join
moved by some oracle or voice divine
and yet who knows but ripening lies in fate
an hour of vengeance for the afflicted state
when great ulysses shall suppress these harms
ulysses singly or all greece in arms
but if athena wars triumphant maid
the happy son will as the father aid

so might she love thee so thy soul inspire
soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid
and long oblivion of the bridal bed

ah no such hope 
can touch my breast that blessing heaven denies
evn by celestial favour were it given
fortune or fate would cross the will of heaven

what words are these and what imprudence thine

forgetful youth but know the power above
with ease can save each object of his love
wide as his will extends his boundless grace
nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place
happier his lot who many sorrows passd
long labouring gains his natal shore at last
than who too speedy hastes to end his life
by some stern ruffian or adulterous wife
death only is the lot which none can miss
and all is possible to heaven but this
the best the dearest favourite of the sky
must taste that cup for man is born to die

thus checkd replied ulysses prudent heir
mentor no morethe mournful thought forbear
for he no more must draw his countrys breath
already snatchd by fate and the black doom of death
pass we to other subjects and engage
on themes remote the venerable sage

for much he knows and just conclusions draws
from various precedents and various laws
o son of neleus awful nestor tell
how he the mighty agamemnon fell
by what strange fraud ægysthus wrought relate
 such a heros fate
live menelaus not in greece or where
was then the martial brothers pious care
condemnd perhaps some foreign shore to tread
or sure ægysthus had not dared the deed

to whom the full of days illustrious youth
attend  the truth
for had the martial menelaus found
the ruffian breathing yet on argive ground
nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies
nor grecian virgins shriekd his obsequies
but fowls obscene dismemberd his remains
and dogs had torn him on the naked plains
while us the works of bloody mars employd
the wanton youth inglorious peace enjoyd
he stretchd at ease in argos calm recess

with flatterys insinuating art
soothed the frail queen and poisond all her heart
at first with worthy shame and decent pride
the royal dame his lawless suit denied
for virtues image yet possessd her mind
taught by a master of the tuneful kind
atrides parting for the trojan war
consignd the youthful consort to his care
true to his charge the bard preserved her long
in honours limits such the power of song
but when the gods these objects of their hate
draggd to destruction by the links of fate
the bard they banishd from his native soil
and left all helpless in a desert isle
there he the sweetest of the sacred train
sung dying to the rocks but sung in vain
then virtue was no more her guard away
she fell to lust a voluntary prey
even to the temple stalkd the adulterous spouse
with impious thanks and mockery of the vows
with images with garments and with gold
and odorous fumes from loaded altars rolld

meantime from flaming troy we cut the way
with menelaus through the curling sea
but when to suniums sacred point we came
crownd with the temple of the athenian dame
atrides pilot phrontes there expired

while yet he exercised the steermans art
apollo touchd him with his gentle dart
even with the rudder in his hand he fell
to pay whole honours to the shades of hell
we checkd our haste by pious office bound
and laid our old companion in the ground
and now the rites discharged our course we keep
far on the gloomy bosom of the deep
soon as malaes misty tops arise
sudden the thunderer blackens all the skies
and the winds whistle and the surges roll
mountains on mountains and obscure the pole
the tempest scatters and divides our fleet
part the storm urges on the coast of crete
where winding round the rich cydonian plain
the streams of jardan issue to the main
there stands a rock high eminent and steep
whose shaggy brow oerhangs the shady deep
and views gortyna on the western side
on this rough auster drove the impetuous tide
with broken force the billows rolld away
and heaved the fleet into the neighbring bay
thus saved from death they gaind the phæstan shores
with shatterd vessels and disabled oars
but five tall barks the winds and water tossd
far from their fellows on the ægyptian coast
there wanderd menelaus through foreign shores
amassing gold and gathering naval stores
while cursed ægysthus the detested deed
by fraud fulfilled and his great brother bled
seven years the traitor rich mycenae swayd
and his stern rule the groaning land obeyd
the eighth from athens to his realm restored
orestes brandishd the avenging sword
slew the dire pair and gave to funeral flame
the vile assassin and adulterous dame
that day ere yet the bloody triumphs cease
returnd atrides to the coast of greece
and safe to argos port his navy brought
with gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught
hence warnd my son beware nor idly stand
too long a stranger to thy native land
lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away
while lawless feasters in thy palace away
perhaps may seize thy realm and share the spoil
and though return with disappointed toil
from thy vain journey to a rifled isle
however my friend indulge one labour more
and seek atrides on the spartan shore
he wandering long a wider circle made
and manylanguaged nations has surveyd
and measured tracks unknown to other ships
amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps

go then to sparta take the watery way
thy ship and sailors but for orders stay
or if my land then choose thy course to bend
my steeds my chariots and my songs attend
thee to atrides they shall safe convey
guides of thy road companions of thy way
urge him with truth to frame his wise replies
and sure he will for menelaus is wise
thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends
and twilight grey her evening shade extends
then thus the blueeyed maid o full of days
wise are thy words and just are all thy ways
now immolate the tongues and mix the wine
sacred to neptune and the powers divine
the lamp of day is quenchd beneath the deep
and soft approach the balmy hours of sleep
nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast
timeless indecent but retire to rest

so spake joves daughter the celestial maid
the sober train attended and obeyd
the sacred heralds on their hands around
pourd the full urns the youths the goblets crownd
from bowl to bowl the homely beverage flows
while to the final sacrifice they rose
the tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame
and pour above the consecrated stream
and now their thirst by copious draughts allayd
the youthful hero and the athenian maid
propose departure from the finishd rite
and in their hollow bark to pass the night
but this hospitable sage denied
forbid it jove and all the gods 
thus from my walls and the muchloved son to send
of such a hero and of such a friend
me as some needy peasant would ye leave
whom heaven denies the blessing to relieve
me would ye leave who boast imperial sway
when beds of royal state invite your stay
nolong as life this mortal shall inspire
or as my children imitate their sire
here shall the wandering stranger find his home
and hospitable rites adorn the dome

well hast thou spoke 
beloved old man benevolent as wise
be the kind dictates of thy heart obeyd
and let thy words telemachus persuade
he to thy palace shall thy steps pursue
i to the ship to give the orders due
prescribe directions and confirm the crew
for i alone sustain their naval cares
who boast experience from these silver hairs
all youths the rest whom to this journey move
like years like tempers and their princes love
there in the vessel shall i pass the night
and soon as morning paints the fields of light
i go to challenge from the caucons bold
a debt contracted in the days of old
but this thy guest received with friendly care
let thy strong coursers swift to sparta bear
prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day
and be thy son companion of his way

then turning with the word minerva flies
and soars an eagle through the liquid skies
vision divine the throngd spectators gaze
in holy wonder fixd and still amaze
but chief the reverend sage admired he took
the hand of young telemachus and spoke
oh happy youth and favoured of the skies
distinguished care of guardian deities
whose early years for future worth engage
no vulgar manhood no ignoble age
for lo none other of the course above
then she the daughter of almighty jove
pallas herself the wartriumphant maid
confessd is thine as once thy fathers aid
so guide me goddess so propitious shine
on me my consort and my royal line
a yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke
untamed unconscious of the galling yoke
with ample forehead and yet tender horns
whose budding honours ductile gold adorns

submissive thus the hoary sire preferrd
his holy vow the favouring goddess heard
then slowly rising oer the sandy space
precedes the father followd by his race
 timely marching home
in comely order to the regal dome
there when arrived on thrones around him placed
his sons and grandsons the wide circle graced
to these the hospitable sage in sign
of social welcome mixd the racy wine

to pallas high the foaming bowl he crownd
and sprinkled large libations on the ground
each drinks a full oblivion of his cares
and to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs
deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid
and slept beneath the pompous colonnade
fast by his side pisistratus was spread
 on a splendid bed
but in an inner court securely closed
the reverend nestor and his queen reposed

when now aurora daughter of the dawn
with rosy lustre purpled oer the lawn
the old man early rose walkd forth and sate
on polishd stone before his palace gate
with unguents smooth the lucid marble shone
where ancient neleus sate a rustic throne
but he descending to the infernal shade
sage nestor filld it and the sceptre swayd
his sons around him mild obeisance pay
and duteous take the orders of the day
first echephron and stratius quit their bed
then perseus aretus and thrasymed
the last pisistratus arose from rest
they came and near him placed the strangerguest
to these the senior thus declared his will
my sons the dictates of your sire fulfil
to pallas first of gods prepare the feast
who graced our rites a more than mortal guest
let one despatchful bid some swain to lead
a wellfed bullock from the grassy mead
one seek the harbour where the vessels moor
and bring thy friends telemachus ashore

another laerceus must we send
artist devine whose skilful hands infold
the victims horn with circumfusile gold
the rest may here the pious duty share
and bid the handmaids for the feast prepare
the seats to range the fragrant wood to bring
and limpid waters from the living spring

he said and busy each his care bestowd
already at the gates the bullock lowd
already came the ithacensian crew
the dexterous smith the tools already drew
his ponderous hammer and his anvil sound
and the strong tongs to turn the metal round
nor was minerva absent from the rite
she viewd her honours and enjoyed the sight
with reverend hand the king presents the gold
which round the intorted horns the gilder rolld
so wrought as pallas might with pride behold
young aretus from forth his bridal bower
brought the full laver oer their hands to pour
and canisters of consecrated flour
stratius and echephron the victim led
the axe was held by warlike thrasymed
in act to strike before him perseus stood
the vase extending to receive the blood
the king himself initiates to the power
scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour
and the stream sprinkles from the curling brows
the hair collected in the fire he throws
soon as due vows on every part were paid
and sacred wheat upon the victim laid
strong thrasymed discharged the speeding blow
full on his neck and cut the nerves in two
down sunk the heavy beast the females round
maids wives and matrons mix a shrilling sound
nor scorned the queen the holy choir to join

from earth they rear him struggling now with death
and nestors youngest stops the vents of breath
the soul for ever flies on all sides round
streams the black blood and smokes upon the ground
the beast they then divide and disunite
the ribs and limbs observant of the rite
on these in double cauls involved with art
the choicest morsels lay from every part
the sacred sage before his altar stands
turns the burnt offering with his holy hands
and pours the wine and bids the flames aspire
the youth with instruments surround the fire
the thighs now sacrificed and entrails dressd
the assistants part transfix and broil the rest
while these officious tend the rites divine
the last fair branch of the nestorean line
sweet polycaste took the pleasing toil
to bathe the prince and pour the fragrant oil
oer his fair limbs a flowery vest he threw
and issued like a god to mortal view
his former seat beside the king he found

all placed at ease the holy banquet join
and in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine

the rage of thirst and hunger now suppressd
the monarch turns him to his royal guest
and for the promised journey bids prepare
the smooth haird horses and the rapid car
observant of his word the word scarce spoke
the sons obey and join them to the yoke
then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings
and presents such as suit the state of kings
the glittering seat telemachus ascends
his faithful guide pisistratus attends
with hasty hand the ruling reins he drew
he lashd the coursers and the coursers flew
beneath the bounding yoke alike they hold
their equal pace and smoked along the field
the towers of pylos sink its views decay
fields after fields fly back till close of day
then sunk the sun and darkend all the way

to pherae now diocleus stately seat
 the weary youths retreat
his house affords the hospitable rite
and pleased they sleep 
but when aurora daughter of the dawn
with rosy lustre purpled oer the lawn
again they mount their journey to renew
and from the sounding portico they flew
along the waving fields their way they hold
the fields receding as their chariot rolld
then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light
and oer the shaded landscape rushd the night







and now proud sparta with their wheels resounds
sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds
at the fair dome the rapid labour ends
where sate atrides midst his bridal friends
with double vows invoking hymens power
to bless his sons and daughters nuptial hour

that day to great achilles son resignd
hermione the fairest of her kind
was sent to crown the longprotracted joy
espoused before the final doom of troy
with steeds and gilded cars a gorgeous train
attend the nymphs to phthias distant reign
meanwhile at home to megapenthes bed
the virgin choir alectors daughter led
brave megapenthes from a stolen amour
to great atrides age his handmaid bore
to helens bed the gods alone assign
hermione to extend the regal line
on whom a radiant pomp of graces wait
resembling venus in attractive state

while this gay friendly troop the king surround
with festival and mirth the roofs resound
a bard amid the joyous circle sings
high airs attemperd to the vocal strings
whilst warbling to the varied strain advance
two sprightly youths to form the bounding dance
twas then that issuing through the palace gate
the splendid car rolld slow in regal state
on the bright eminence young nestor shone
and fast beside him great ulysses son
grave eteoneus saw the pomp appear
and speeding thus addressd the royal ear

two youths approach whose semblant features prove
their blood devolving from the source of jove
is due reception deignd or must they bend
their doubtful course to seek a distant friend

insensate 
too long misjudging have i thought thee wise
but sure relentless folly steels thy breast
obdurate to reject the strangerguest
to those dear hospitable rites a foe
which in my wanderings oft relieved my woe
fed by the bounty of anothers board
till pitying jove my native realm restored
straight be the coursers from the car released
conduct the youths to grace the genial feast

the seneschal rebuked in haste withdrew
with equal haste a menial train pursue
part led the coursers from the car enlarged
each to a crib with choicest grain surcharged
part in a portico profusely graced
with rich magnificence the chariot placed
then to the dome the friendly pair invite
who eye the dazzling roofs with vast delight
resplendent as the blaze of summer noon
or the pale radiance of the midnight moon
from room to room their eager view they bend
thence to the bath a beauteous pile descend
where a bright damsel train attends the guests
with liquid odours and embroiderd vests
refreshd they wait them to the bower of state
where circled with his peers atrides sate
throned next the king a fair attendant brings
the purest product of the crystal springs
high on a massy vase of silver mould
the burnishd laver flames with solid gold
in solid gold the purple vintage flows
and on the board a second banquet rose
when thus the king with hospitable port
accept this welcome to the spartan court
the waste of nature let the feast repair
then your high lineage and your names declare
say from what sceptred ancestry ye claim
recorded eminent in deathless fame
for vulgar parents cannot stamp their race
with signatures of such majestic grace

ceasing benevolent he straight assigns
the royal portion of the choicest chines
to each accepted friend with grateful haste
they share the honours of the rich repast
sufficed soft whispering thus to nestors son
his head reclined young ithacus begun

viewst thou unmoved o everhonourd most
these prodigies of art and wondrous cost
above beneath around the palace shines
the sunless treasure of exhausted mines
the spoils of elephants the roofs inlay
and studded amber darts the golden ray
such and not nobler in the realms above
my wonder dictates is the dome of jove

the monarch took the word and grave replied
presumptuous are the vaunts and vain the pride
of man who dares in pomp with jove contest
unchanged immortal and supremely blest
with all my affluence when my woes are weighd
envy will own the purchase dearly paid
for eight slowcircling years by tempests tossd
from cypress to the far phoenician coast
 i stretchd my toil
through regions fattend with the flows of nile
next aethiopias utmost bound explore
and the parchd borders of the arabian shore
then warp my voyage on the southern gales
oer the warm lybian wave to spread my sails
that happy clime where each revolving year
the teeming ewes a triple offspring bear
and two fair crescents of translucent horn
the brows of all their young increase adorn
the shepherd swains with sure abundance blest
on the fat flock and rural dainties feast
nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail
but every season fills the foaming pail
whilst heaping unwashd wealth i distant roam
the best of brothers at his natal home
by the dire fury of a traitress wife
ends the sad evening of a stormy life
whence with incessant grief my soul annoyd
these riches are possessd but not enjoyd
my wars the copious theme of every tongue
to you your fathers have recorded long
how favouring heaven repaid my glorious toils
with a sackd palace and barbaric spoils
oh had the gods so large a boon denied
and life the just equivalent supplied
to those brave warriors who with glory fired
far from their country in my cause expired
still in short intervals of pleasing woe
regardful of the friendly dues i owe
i to the glorious dead for ever dear
indulge the tribute of a grateful tear
but oh ulyssesdeeper than the rest
that sad idea wounds my anxious breast
my heart bleeds fresh with agonizing pain
the bowl and tasteful viands tempt in vain
nor sleeps soft power can close my streaming eyes
when imaged to my soul his sorrows rise
no peril in my cause he ceased to prove
his labours equalld only by my love
and both alike to bitter fortune born
for him to suffer and for me to mourn
whether he wanders on some friendly coast
or glides in stygian gloom a pensive ghost
no fame reveals but doubtful of his doom
his good old sire with sorrow to the tomb
declines his trembling steps untimely care
withers the blooming vigour of his heir
and the chaste partner of his bed and throne
wastes all her widowd hours in tender moan

while thus pathetic to the prince he spoke
from the brave youth the streaming passion broke
studious to veil the grief in vain repressd
his face he shrouded with his purple vest
the conscious monarch pierced the coy disguise
and viewd his filial love with vast surprise
dubious to press the tender theme or wait
to hear the youth inquire his fathers fate
in this suspense bright helen graced the room
before her breathed a gale of rich perfume
so moves adornd with each attractive grace
the silver shafted goddess of the chase
the seat of majesty adraste brings
with art illustrious for the pomp of kings
to spread the pall 
of softest wool is bright alcippes care
a silver canister divinely wrought
in her soft hands the beauteous phylo brought
to spartas queen of old the radiant vase
alcandra gave a pledge of royal grace
for polybus her lord 
when to that court atrides came caressd
with vast munificence the imperial guest
two lavers from the richest ore refined
with silver tripods the kind host assignd
and bounteous from the royal treasure told
ten equal talents of refulgent gold
alcandra consort of his high command
a golden distaff gave to helens hand
and that rich vase with living sculpture wrought
which heapd with wool the beauteous phylo brought
the silken fleece impurpled for the loom
rivalld the hyacinth in vernal bloom
the sovereign seat then jove born helen pressd
and pleasing thus her sceptred lord addressd

who grace our palace now that friendly pair
speak they their lineage or their names declare
uncertain of the truth yet uncontrolld
hear me the bodings of my breast unfold
with wonder wrappd on yonder check i trace
the feature of the ulyssean race
diffused oer each resembling line appear
in just similitude the grace and air
of young telemachus the lovely boy
who blessd ulysses with a fathers joy
what time the greeks combined their social arms
to avenge the stain of my illfated charms

just is thy thought 
methinks ulysses strikes my wondering eyes
full shines the father in the filial frame
his port his features and his shape the same
such quick regards his sparkling eyes bestow
such wavy ringlets oer his shoulders flow
and when he heard the long disastrous store
of cares which in my cause ulysses bore
dismayd heartwounded with paternal woes
above restraint the tide of sorrow rose
cautious to let the gushing grief appear
his purple garment veild the falling tear

see there confessd 
the genuine worth of ithacus the wise
of that heroic sire the youth is sprung
but modest awe hath chaind his timorous tongue
thy voice o king with pleased attention heard
is like the dictates of a god revered
with him at nestors high command i came
whose age i honour with a parents name
by adverse destiny constrained to sue
for counsel and redress he sues to you
whatever ill the friendless orphan bears
bereaved of parents in his infant years
still must the wrongd telemachus sustain
if hopeful of your aid he hopes in vain
affianced in your friendly power alone
the youth would vindicate the vacant throne

is sparta blest and these desiring eyes
view my friends son 
son of my friend by glorious toils approved
whose sword was sacred to the man he loved
mirror of constant faith revered and mournd
when troy was ruind had the chief returnd
no greek an equal space had ere possessd
of dear affection in my grateful breast
i to confirm the mutual joys we shared
for his abode a capital prepared
argos the seat of sovereign rule i chose
fair in the plan the future palace rose
where my ulysses and his race might reign
and portion to his tribes the wide domain
to them my vassals had resignd a soil
with teeming plenty to reward their toil
there with commutual zeal we both had strove
in acts of dear benevolence and love
brothers in peace not rivals in command
and death alone dissolved the friendly band
some envious power the blissful scene destroys
vanishd are all the visionary joys
the soul of friendship to my hope is lost
fated to wander from his natal coast

he ceased a gush of grief began to rise
fast streams a tide from beauteous helens eyes
fast for the sire the filial sorrows flow
the weeping monarch swells the mighty woe
thy cheeks pisistratus the tears bedew
while pictured so thy mind appeard in view
thy martial brother on the phrygian plain
extended pale by swarthy memnon slain
but silence soon the son of nestor broke
and melting with fraternal pity spoke

frequent o king was nestor wont to raise
and charm attention with thy copious praise
to crowd thy various gifts the sage assignd
the glory of a firm capacious mind
with that superior attribute control
this unavailing impotence of soul
let not your roof with echoing grief resound
now for the feast the friendly bowl is crownd
but when from dewy shade emerging bright
aurora streaks the sky with orient light
let each deplore his dead the rites of woe
are all alas the living can bestow
oer the congenial dust enjoind to shear
the graceful curl and drop the tender tear
then mingling in the mournful pomp with you
ill pay my brothers ghost a warriors due
and mourn the brave antilochus a name
not unrecorded in the rolls of fame
with strength and speed superior formd in fight
to face the foe or intercept his flight
too early snatchd by fate ere known to me
i boast a witness of his worth in thee

young and mature 
in thee renewd the soul of nestor shines
formd by the care of that consummate sage
in early bloom an oracle of age
wheneer his influence jove vouchsafes to shower
to bless the natal and the nuptial hour
from the great sire transmissive to the race
the boon devolving gives distinguishd grace
such happy nestor was thy glorious doom
around thee full of years thy offspring bloom
expert of arms and prudent in debate
the gifts of heaven to guard thy hoary state
but now let each becalm his troubled breast
wash and partake serene the friendly feast
to move thy suit telemachus delay
till heavens revolving lamp restores the day

he said asphalion swift the laver brings
alternate all partake the grateful springs
then from the rites of purity repair
and with keen gust the savoury viands share
meantime with genial joy to warm the soul
bright helen mixd a mirth inspiring bowl
temperd with drugs of sovereign use to assuage
the boiling bosom of tumultuous rage
to clear the cloudy front of wrinkled care
and dry the tearful sluices of despair
charmd with that virtuous draught the exalted mind
all sense of woe delivers to the wind
though on the blazing pile his parent lay
or a loved brother groand his life away
or darling son oppressd by ruffian force
fell breathless at his feet a mangled corse
from morn to eve impassive and serene
the man entranced would view the dreadful scene
these drugs so friendly to the joys of life
bright helen learnd from thones imperial wife
who swayd the sceptre where prolific nile
with various simples clothes the fattend soil
with wholesome herbage mixd the direful bane
of vegetable venom taints the plain
from paeon sprung their patrongod imparts
to all the pharian race his healing arts
the beverage now prepared to inspire the feast
the circle thus the beauteous queen addressed

throned in omnipotence supremest jove
tempers the fates of human race above
by the firm sanction of his sovereign will
alternate are decreed our good and ill
to feastful mirth be this white hour assignd
and sweet discourse the banquet of the mind
myself assisting in the social joy
will tell ulysses bold exploit in troy
sole witness of the deed i now declare
speak you  his wonders in the war

seamd oer with wounds which his own sabre gave
in the vile habit of a village slave
the foe deceived he passd the tented plain
in troy to mingle with the hostile train
in this attire secure from searching eyes
till happily piercing through the dark disguise
the chief i challenged he whose practised wit
knew all the serpent mazes of deceit
eludes my search but when his form i viewd
fresh from the bath with fragrant oils renewd
his limbs in military purple dressd
each brightening grace the genuine greek confessd
a previous pledge of sacred faith obtaind
till he the lines and argive fleet regaind
to keep his stay conceald the chief declared
the plans of war against the town prepared
exploring then the secrets of the state
he learnd what best might urge the dardan fate
and safe returning to the grecian host
sent many a shade to plutos dreary coast
loud grief resounded through the towers of troy
but my pleased bosom glowd with secret joy
for then with dire remorse and conscious shame
i viewd the effects of that disastrous flame
which kindled by the imperious queen of love
constraind me from my native realm to rove
and oft in bitterness of soul deplored
my absent daughter and my dearer lord
admired among the first of human race
for every gift of mind and manly grace

right well  your speech displays
the matchless merit of the chief you praise
heroes in various climes myself have found
for martial deeds and depth of thought renownd
but ithacus unrivalld in his claim
may boast a title to the loudest fame
in battle calm he guides the rapid storm
wise to resolve and patient to perform
what wondrous conduct in the chief appeard
when the vast fabric of the steed we reard
some demon anxious for the trojan doom
urged you with great deiphobus to come
to explore the fraud with guile opposed to guile
slowpacing thrice around the insidious pile
each noted leaders name you thrice invoke
your accent varying as their spouses spoke
the pleasing sounds each latent warrior warmd
but most tydides and my heart alarmd
to quit the steed we both impatient press
threatening to answer from the dark recess
unmoved the mind of ithacus remaind
and the vain ardours of our love restraind
but anticlus unable to control
spoke loud the language of his yearning soul
ulysses straight with indignation fired

firm to his lips his forceful hands applied
till on his tongue the fluttering murmurs died
meantime minerva from the fraudful horse
back to the court of priam bent your course

inclement fate 
frail is the boasted attribute of wise
the leader mingling with the vulgar host
is in the common mass of matter lost
but now let sleep the painful waste repair
of sad reflection and corroding care
he ceased the menial fair that round her wait
at helens beck prepare the room of state
beneath an ample portico they spread
the downy fleece to form the slumberous bed
and oer soft palls of purple grain unfold
rich tapestry stiff with interwoven gold
then through the illumined dome to balmy rest
the obsequious herald guides each princely guest
while to his regal bower the king ascends
and beauteous helen on her lord attends
soon as the morn in orient purple dressd
unbarrd the portal of the roseate east
the monarch rose magnificent to view
the imperial mantle oer his vest he threw
the glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast
a starry falchion lowdepending graced
claspd on his feet the embroidered sandals shine
and forth he moves majestic and divine
instant to young telemachus he pressd
and thus benevolent his speech addressed

say royal youth sincere of soul report
whit cause hath led you to the spartan court
do public or domestic care constrain
this toilsome voyage oer the surgy main

o highlyfavourd delegate of jove
 inflamed with filial love
and anxious hope to hear my parents doom
a suppliant to your royal court i come
our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race
with lawless riot and misrule disgrace
to pamperd insolence devoted fall
prime of the flock and choicest of the stall
for wild ambition wings their bold desire
and all to mount the imperial bed aspire
but prostrate i implore o king relate
the mournful series of my fathers fate
each known disaster of the man disclose
born by his mother to a world of woes
recite them nor in erring pity fear
to wound with storied grief the filial ear
if eer ulysses to reclaim your right
avowd his zeal in council or in fight
if phrygian camps the friendly toils attest
to the sires merit give the sons request

deep from his inmost soul atrides sighd
and thus indignant to the prince replied
heavens would a soft inglorious dastard train
an absent heros nuptial joys profane
so with her young amid the woodland shades
a timorous hind the lions court invades
leaves in the fatal lair the tender fawns
climbs the green cliff or feeds the flowery lawns
meantime returnd with dire remorseless sway
the monarchsavage rends the trembling prey
with equal fury and with equal fame
ulysses soon shall reassert his claim
o jove supreme whom gods and men revere
and thou to whom tis given to gild the sphere
with power congenial joind propitious aid
the chief adopted by the martial maid
such to our wish the warrior soon restore
as when contending on the lesbian shore
his prowess philomelidies confessd
and loudacclaiming greeks the victor blessd
then soon the invaders of his bed and throne
their love presumptuous shall with life atone
with patient ear o royal youth attend
the storied labour of thy fathers friend
fruitful of deeds the copious tale is long
but truth severe shall dictate to my tongue
learn what i heard the seaborn seer relate
whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate

long on the egyptian coast by calms confined
heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind
no vows had we preferrd nor victims slain
for this the gods each favouring gale restrain
jealous to see their high behests obeyd
severe if men the eternal rights evade
high oer a gulfy sea the pharian isle
fronts the deep roar of disemboguing nile
her distance from the shore the course begun
at dawn and ending with the setting sun
a galley measures when the stiffer gales
rise on the poop and fully stretch the sails
there anchord vessels safe in harbour lie
whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply

and now the twentieth sun descending laves
his glowing axle in the western waves
still with expanded sails we court in vain
propitious winds to waft us oer the main
and the pale mariner at once deplores
his drooping vigour and exhausted stores
when lo a bright cerulean form appears
proteus her sire divine with pity pressd
me sole the daughter of the deep addressd
what time with hunger pined my absent mates
roam the wide isle in search of rural cates
bait the barbd steel and from the fishy flood
appease the afflictive fierce desire of food

whoeer thou art 
thy conduct illdeserves the praise of wise
is death thy choice or misery thy boast
that here inglorious on a barren coast
thy brave associates droop a meagre train
with famine pale and ask thy care in vain
struck with the loud reproach i straight reply
whateer thy title in thy native sky
a goddess sure for more than moral grace
speaks thee descendant of ethereal race
deem not that here of choice my fleet remains
some heavenly power averse my stay constrains
o piteous of my fate vouchsafe to show

what power becalms the innavigable seas
what guilt provokes him and what vows appease

i ceased when affable the goddess cried
observe and in the truths i speak confide
the oracular seer frequents the pharian coast
from whose high bed my birth divine i boast
proteus a name tremendous oer the main
the delegate of neptunes watery reign
watch with insidious care his known abode
there fast in chains constrain the various god
who bound obedient to superior force
unerring will prescribe your destined course
if studious on your realms you then demand
their state since last you left your natal land
instant the god obsequious will disclose
bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes

she ceased and suppliant thus i made reply
o goddess on thy aid my hopes rely
dictate propitious to my duteous ear
what arts can captivate the changeful seer
for perilous the assay unheard the toil
to elude the prescience of a god by guile

thus to the goddess mild my suit i end
then she obedient to my rule attend
when through the zone of heaven the mounted sun
hath journeyed half and half remains to run
the seer while zephyrs curl the swelling deep
basks on the breezy shore in grateful sleep
his oozy limbs emerging from the wave
the phocas swift surround his rocky cave
frequent and full the consecrated train
of her whose azure trident awes the main
there wallowing warm the enormous herd exhales
an oily steam and taints the noontide gales
to that recess commodious for surprise
when purple light shall next suffuse the skies
with me repair and from thy warriorband
three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command
let their auxiliar force befriend the toil
for strong the god and perfected in guile
stretchd on the shelly shore he first surveys
the flouncing herd ascending from the seas
their number summd reposed in sleep profound
the scaly charge their guardian god surround
so with his battening flocks the careful swain
abides paviliond on the grassy plain
with powers united obstinately bold
invade him couchd amid the scaly fold
instant he wears elusive of the rape
the mimic force of every savage shape
or glides with liquid lapse a murmuring stream
or wrappd in flame he glows at every limb
yet still retentive with redoubled might
through each vain passive form constrain his flight
but when his native shape renamed he stands
patient of conquest and your cause demands
the cause that urged the bold attempt declare
and soothe the vanquishd with a victors prayer
the bands releasd implore the seer to say
what godhead interdicts the watery way
who straight propitious in prophetic strain
will teach you to repass the unmeasured main
she ceased and bounding from the shelfy shore
round the descending nymph the waves resounding roar

high wrappd in wonder of the future deed
with joy impetuous to the port i speed
the wants of nature with repast suffice
till night with grateful shade involved the skies
and shed ambrosial dews fast by the deep
along the tented shore in balmy sleep
our cares were lost when oer the eastern lawn
in saffron robes the daughter of the dawn
advanced her rosy steps before the bay
due ritual honours to the gods i pay
then seek the place the seaborn nymph assignd
with three associates of undaunted mind
arrived to form along the appointed strand
for each a bed she scoops the hilly sand
then from her azure cave the finny spoils
of four vast phocae takes to veil her wiles
beneath the finny spoils extended prone
hard toil the prophets piercing eye to shun
new from the corse the scaly frauds diffuse
unsavoury stench of oil and brackish ooze
but the bright seamaids gentle power implored
with nectard drops the sickening sense restored

thus till the sun had travelld half the skies
ambushd we lie and wait the bold emprise
when thronging quick to bask in open air
the flocks of ocean to the strand repair
couchd on the sunny sand the monsters sleep
then proteus mounting from the hoary deep
surveys his charge unknowing of deceit

pleased with the false review secure he lies
and leaden slumbers press his drooping eyes
rushing impetuous forth we straight prepare
a furious onset with the sound of war
and shouting seize the god our force to evade
his various arts he soon resumes in aid
a lion now he curls a surgy mane
sudden our hands a spotted pard restrain
then armd with tusks and lightning in his eyes
a boars obscener shape the god belies
on spiry volumes there a dragon rides
here from our strict embrace a stream he glides
at last sublime his stately growth he rears
a tree and welldissembled foliage wears
vain efforts with superior power compressd
me with reluctance thus the seer addressd
say son of atreus say what god inspired
this daring fraud and what the boon desired
i thus o thou whose certain eye foresees
the fixd event of fates remote decrees
after long woes and various toil endured
still on this desert isle my fleet is moord
unfriended of the gales allknowing say
what godhead interdicts the watery way
what vows repentant will the power appease
to speed a prosperous voyage oer the seas

to jove 
and all the offended synod of the skies
just hecatombs with due devotion slain
thy guilt absolved a prosperous voyage gain
to the firm sanction of thy fate attend
an exile thou nor cheering face of friend
nor sight of natal shore nor regal dome
shalt yet enjoy but still art doomd to roam
once more the nile who from the secret source
of joves high seat descends with sweepy force
must view his billows white beneath thy oar
and altars blaze along his sanguine shore
then will the gods with holy pomp adored
to thy long vows a safe return accord

he ceased heart wounded with afflictive pain
 o seer i cry
to the stern sanction of the offended sky
my prompt obedience bows but deign to say
what fate propitious or what dire dismay
sustain those peers the relics of our host
whom i with nestor on the phrygian coast
embracing left must i the warriors weep
whelmd in the bottom of the monstrous deep
or did the kind domestic friend deplore
the breathless heroes on their native shore

press not too far replied the god but cease
to know what known will violate thy peace
too curious of their doom with friendly woe
thy breast will heave and tears eternal flow
part live the rest a lamentable train
range the dark bounds of plutos dreary reign
two foremost in the roll of mars renownd
whose arms with conquest in thy cause were crownd
fell by disastrous fate by tempests tossd
a third lives wretched on a distant coast

by neptune rescued from minervas hate
on gyrae safe oilean ajax sate
his ship oerwhelmd but frowning on the floods
impious he roard defiance to the gods
to his own prowess all the glory gave
the power defrauding who vouchsafed to save
this heard the raging ruler of the main
his spear indignant for such high disdain
he launched dividing with his forky mace
the aërial summit from the marble base
the rock rushd seaward with impetuous roar
ingulfd and to the abyss the boaster bore

by junos guardian aid the watery vast
secure of storms your royal brother passd
till coasting nigh the cape where malen shrouds
her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds
a whirling gust tumultuous from the shore
across the deep his labouring vessel bore
in an illfated hour the coast he gaind
where late in regal pomp thyestes reigned
but when his hoary honours bowd to fate
ægysthus governd in paternal state
the surges now subside the tempest ends
from his tall ship the king of men descends
there fondly thinks the gods conclude his toil
far from his own domain salutes the soil
with rapture oft the verge of greece reviews
and the dear turf with tears of joy bedews
him thus exulting on the distant stand
a spy distinguishd from his airy stand
to bribe whose vigilance ægysthus told
a mighty sum of illpersuading gold
there watchd this guardian of his guilty fear
till the twelfth moon had wheeld her pale career
and now admonishd by his eye to court
with terror wingd conveys the dread report
of deathful arts expert his lord employs
the ministers of blood in dark surprise
and twenty youths in radiant mail incased
close ambushd nigh the spacious hall he placed
then bids prepare the hospitable treat
vain shows of love to veil his felon hate
to grace the victors welcome from the wars
a train of coursers and triumphal cars
magnificent he leads the royal guest
thoughtless of ill accepts the fraudful feast
the troop forthissuing from the dark recess
with homicidal rage the king oppress
so whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall
the sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall
the partners of his fame and toils at troy
around their lord a mighty ruin lie
mixd with the brave the base invaders bleed
ægysthus sole survives to boast the deed

he said chill horrors shook my shivering soul
rackd with convulsive pangs in dust i roll
and hate in madness of extreme despair
to view the sun or breathe the vital air
but when superior to the rage of woe
i stood restored and tears had ceased to flow
lenient of grief the pitying god began
forget the brother and resume the man
to fates supreme dispose the dead resign
that care be fates a speedy passage thine
still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplored
but lives a victim for thy vengeful sword
unless with filial rage orestes glow
and swift prevent the meditated blow
you timely will return a welcome guest
with him to share the sad funereal feast

he said new thoughts my beating heart employ
my gloomy soul receives a gleam of joy
fair hope revives and eager i addressd
the prescient godhead to reveal the rest
the doom decreed of those disastrous two
ive heard with pain but oh the tale pursue
what third brave son of mars the fates constrain
to roam the howling desert of the main
or in eternal shade of cold he lies
provoke new sorrows from these grateful eyes

that chief  his race derives
from ithaca and wondrous woes survives
laertes son girt with circumfluous tides
he still calamitous constraint abides
him in calypsos cave of late i viewd
when streaming grief his faded cheek bedowd
but vain his prayer his arts are vain to move
the enamourd goddess or elude her love
his vessel sunk and dear companions lost
he lives reluctant on a foreign coast
but oh beloved by heaven reserved to thee
a happier lot the smiling fates decree
free from that law beneath whose mortal sway
matter is changed and varying forms decay
elysium shall be thine the blissful plains
of utmost earth where rhadamanthus reigns
joys ever young unmixd with pain or fear
fill the wide circle of the eternal year
stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime
the fields are florid with unfading prime
from the bleak pole no winds inclement blow
mould the round hail or flake the fleecy snow
but from the breezy deep the blest inhale
the fragrant murmurs of the western gale
this grace peculiar will the gods afford
to thee the son of jove and beauteous helens lord

he ceased and plunging in the vast profound
beneath the god and whirling billows bound
then speeding back involved in various thought
my friends attending at the shore i sought
arrived the rage of hunger we control
till night with silent shade invests the pole
then lose the cares of life in pleasing rest
soon as the morn reveals the roseate east
with sails we wing the masts our anchors weigh
unmoor the fleet and rush into the sea
ranged on the banks beneath our equal oars
white curl the waves and the vexd ocean roars
then steering backward from the pharian isle
we gain the stream of jovedescended nile
there quit the ships and on the destined shore
with ritual hecatombs the gods adore
their wrath atoned to agamemnons name
a cenotaph i raise of deathless fame
these rites to piety and grief discharged
the friendly gods a springing gale enlarged
the fleet swift tilting oer the surges flew
till grecian cliffs appeard a blissful view

thy patient ear hath heard me long relate
a story fruitful of disastrous fate
and now young prince indulge my fond request
be sparta honoured with his royal guest
till from his eastern goal the joyous sun
his twelfth diurnal race begins to run
meantime my train the friendly gifts prepare
the sprightly coursers and a polishd car
with these a goblet of capacious mould
figured with art to dignify the gold
 shall prove
a pledge and monument of sacred love

my quick return 
damps the warm wishes of my raptured mind
did not my fate my needful haste constrain
charmd by your speech so graceful and humane
lost in delight the circling year would roll
while deep attention fixd my listening soul
but now to pyle permit my destined way
my loved associates chide my long delay
in dear remembrance of your royal grace
i take the present of the promised vase
the coursers for the champaign sports retain
that gift our barren rocks will render vain
horrid with cliffs our meagre land allows
thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse
but neither mead nor plain supplies to feed
the sprightly courser or indulge his speed
to seasurrounded realms the gods assign
small tract of fertile lawn the least to mine

his hand the king with tender passion pressd
and smiling thus the royal youth addressd
o early worth a soul so wise and young
proclaims you from the sage ulysses sprung
selected from my stores of matchless price
an urn shall recompense your prudent choice
by vulcans art the verge with gold enchased
a pledge the sceptred power of sidon gave
when to his realm i ploughd the orient wave

thus they alternate while with artful care
the menial train the regal feast prepare
the firstlings of the flock are doomd to die
rich fragrant wines the cheering bowl supply
a female band the gift of ceres bring
and the gilt roofs with genial triumph ring

meanwhile in ithaca the suitor powers
in active games divide their jovial hours
in areas varied with mosaic art
some whirl the disk and some the javelin dart
aside sequesterd from the vast resort
antinous sole spectator of the sport
with great eurymachus of worth confessd
and high descent superior to the rest
whom young noëmon lowly thus addressd

my ship equippd within the neighboring port
the prince departing for the pylian court
requested for his speed but courteous say
when steers he home or why this long delay
for elis i should sail with utmost speed
to import twelve mares which there luxurious feed
and twelve young mules a strong laborious race
new to the plow unpractised in the trace

unknowing of the course to pyle designd
a sudden horror seized on either mind
the prince in rural bower they fondly thought
numbering his flocks and herds not far remote
relate  devoid of guile
when spread the prince his sale for distant pyle
did chosen chiefs across the gulfy main
attend his voyage or domestic train
spontaneous did you speed his secret course
or was the vessel seized by fraud or force

with willing duty not reluctant mind
 the vessel was resignd
who in the balance with the great affairs
of courts presume to weigh their private cares
with him the peerage next in power to you
and mentor captain of the lordly crew
or some celestial in his reverend form
safe from the secret rock and adverse storm
pilots the course for when the glimmering ray
of yester dawn disclosed the tender day
mentor himself i saw and much admired
then ceased the youth and from the court retired

confounded and appalld the unfinishd game
the suitors quit and all to council came
antinous first the assembled peers addressd
rage sparkling in his eyes and burning in his breast

o shame to manhood shall one daring boy
the scheme of all our happiness destroy
fly unperceived seducing half the flower
of nobles and invite a foreign power
the ponderous engine raised to crush us all
recoiling on his head is sure to fall
instant prepare me on the neighbouring strand
with twenty chosen mates a vessel mannd
for ambushd close beneath the samian shore
his ship returning shall my spies explore
he soon his rashness shall with life atone
seek for his fathers fate but find his own

with vast applause the sentence all approve
then rise and to the feastful hall remove
swift to the queen the herald medon ran
who heard the consult of the dire divan
before her dome the royal matron stands
and thus the message of his haste demands

what will the suitors must my servanttrain
the allotted labours of the day refrain
for them to form some exquisite repast
heaven grant this festival may prove their last
or if they still must live from me remove
the double plague of luxury and love
forbear ye sons of insolence forbear
in riot to consume a wretched heir
in the young soul illustrious thought to raise
were ye not tutord with ulysses praise
have not your fathers oft my lord defined
gentle of speech beneficent of mind
some kings with arbitrary rage devour
or in their tyrantminions vest the power
ulysses let no partial favours fall
the peoples parent he protected all
but absent now perfidious and ingrate
his stores ye ravage and usurp his state

he thus o were the woes you speak the worst
they form a deed more odious and accursed
more dreadful than your boding soul divines
but pitying jove avert the dire designs
the darling object of your royal care
is marked to perish in a deathful snare
before he anchors in his native port
from pyle resailing and the spartan court
horrid to speak in ambush is decreed
the hope and heir of ithaca to bleed

sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes
the vital streams a chilling horror froze
the big round tear stands trembling in her eye
and on her tongue imperfect accents die
at length in tender language interwove
with sighs she thus expressed her anxious love
why rarely would my son his fate explore
ride the wild waves and quit the safer shore
did he with all the greatly wretched crave
a blank oblivion and untimely grave

tis not  to medon given
to know if some inhabitant of heaven
in his young breast the daring thought inspired
or if alone with filial duty fired
the winds and waves he tempts in early bloom
studious to learn his absent fathers doom

the sage retired unable to control
the mighty griefs that swell her labouring soul
rolling convulsive on the floor is seen
the piteous object of a prostrate queen
words to her dumb complaint a pause supplies
and breath to waste in unavailing cries
around their sovereign wept the menial fair
to whom she thus addressd her deep despair

behold a wretch whom all the gods consign
to woe did ever sorrows equal mine
long to my joys my dearest lord is lost
his countrys buckler and the grecian boast
now from my fond embrace by tempests torn
our other column of the state is borne
nor took a kind adieu nor sought consent
unkind confederates in his dire intent
ill suits it with your shows of duteous zeal
from me the purposed voyage to conceal
though at the solemn midnight hour he rose
why did you fear to trouble my repose
he either had obeyd my fond desire
or seen his mother pierced with grief expire
bid dolius quick attend the faithful slave
whom to my nuptial train icarius gave
to tend the fruit groves with incessant speed
he shall this violence of death decreed
to good laertes tell experienced age
may timely intercept the ruffian rage
convene the tribes the murderous plot reveal
and to their power to save his race appeal

then euryclea thus my dearest dread
though to the sword i bow this hoary head
or if a dungeon be the pain decreed
i own me conscious of the unpleasing deed
auxiliar to his flight my aid implored
with wine and viands i the vessel stored
a solemn oath imposed the secret seald
till the twelfth dawn the light of day reveald
dreading the effect of a fond mothers fear
he dared not violate your royal ear
but bathe and in imperial robes arrayd
pay due devotions to the martial maid
and rest affianced in her guardian aid
send not to good laertes nor engage
in toils of state the miseries of age
tis impious to surmise the powers divine
to ruin doom the jovedescended line
long shall the race of just arcesius reign
and isles remote enlarge his old domain

the queen her speech with calm attention hears
her eyes restrain the silverstreaming tears
she bathes and robed the sacred dome ascends
her pious speed a female train attends
the salted cakes in canisters are laid
and thus the queen invokes minervas aid

daughter divine of jove whose arm can wield
the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
if eer ulysses to thy fane preferrd
the best and choicest of his flock and herd
hear goddess hear by those oblations won
and for the pious sire preserve the son
his wishd return with happy power befriend
and on the suitors let thy wrath descend

she ceased shrill ecstasies of joy declare
the favouring goddess present to the prayer
the suitors heard and deemd the mirthful voice
a signal of her hymeneal choice
whilst one most jovial thus accosts the board

too late the queen selects a second lord
in evil hour the nuptial rite intends
when oer her son disastrous death impends
thus he unskilld of what the fates provide
but with severe rebuke antinous cried

these empty vaunts will make the voyage vain
alarm not with discourse the menial train
the great event with silent hope attend
our deeds alone our counsel must commend
his speech thus ended short he frowning rose
and twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose
down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides
where anchord in the bay the vessel rides
replete with mail and military store
in all her tackle trim to quit the shore
the desperate crew ascend unfurl the sails

then take repast till hesperus displayd
his golden circlet in the western shade

meantime the queen without reflection due
heartwounded to the bed of state withdrew
in her sad breast the princes fortunes roll
and hope and doubt alternate seize her soul
so when the woodmans toil her cave surrounds
and with the hunters cry the grove resounds
with grief and rage the motherlion stung
fearless herself yet trembles for her young
while pensive in the silent slumberous shade
sleeps gentle powers her drooping eyes invade
minerva lifelike on embodied air
impressd the form of iphthima the fair

as pallas willd along the sable skies
to calm the queen the phantom sister flies
swift on the regal dome descending right
the bolted valves are pervious to her flight
close to her head the pleasing vision stands
and thus performs minervas high commands

o why penelope this causeless fear
to render sleeps soft blessing unsincere
alike devote to sorrows dire extreme
the dayreflection and the midnightdream
thy son the gods propitious will restore
and bid thee cease his absence to deplore

to whom the queen 
o sister to my soul forever dear
why this first visit to reprove my fear
how in a realm so distant should you know
from what deep source my ceaseless sorrows flow
to all my hope my royal lord is lost
his countrys buckler and the grecian boast
and with consummate woe to weigh me down
the heir of all his honours and his crown
my darling son is fled an easy prey
to the fierce storms or men more fierce than they
who in a league of blood associates sworn
will intercept the unwary youths return

courage resume 
in the protecting care of heaven confide
on him attends the blue eyed martial maid
what earthly can implore a surer aid
me now the guardian goddess deigns to send
to bid thee patient his return attend

the queen replies if in the blest abodes
a goddess thou hast commerce with the gods
say breathes my lord the blissful realm of light
or lies he wrappd in everduring night

inquire not of his doom 
i speak not all the counsel of the skies
nor must indulge with vain discourse or long
the windy satisfaction of the tongue

swift through the valves the visionary fair
repassd and viewless mixd with common air
the queen awakes deliverd of her woes
with florid joy her heart dilating glows
the vision manifest of future fate
makes her with hope her sons arrival wait

meantime the suitors plough the watery plain
telemachus in thought already slain
when sight of lessening ithaca was lost
their sail directed for the samian coast
a small but verdant isle appeard in view
and asteris the advancing pilot knew
an ample port the rocks projected form
to break the rolling waves and ruffling storm
that safe recess they gain with happy speed
and in close ambush wait the murderous deed







the saffron morn with early blushes spread
now rose refulgent from tithonus bed
with newborn day to gladden mortal sight
and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light
then met the eternal synod of the sky
before the god who thunders from on high
supreme in might sublime in majesty
pallas to these deplores the unequal fates
of wise ulysses and his toils relates
her heros danger touchd the pitying power
the nymphs seducements and the magic bower
thus she began her plaint immortal jove
and you who fill the blissful seats above
let kings no more with gentle mercy sway
or bless a people willing to obey
but crush the nations with an iron rod
and every monarch be the scourge of god
if from your thoughts ulysses you remove
who ruled his subjects with a fathers love
sole in an isle encircled by the main
abandond banishd from his native reign
unblessd he sighs detained by lawless charms
and pressd unwilling in calypsos arms
nor friends are there nor vessels to convey
nor oars to cut the immeasurable way
and now fierce traitors studious to destroy
his only son their ambushd fraud employ
who pious following his great fathers fame
to sacred pylos and to sparta came

what words are these 
is not already in thy soul decreed
the chiefs return shall make the guilty bleed
what cannot wisdom do thou mayst restore
the son in safety to his native shore
while the fell foes who late in ambush lay
with fraud defeated measure back their way

then thus to hermes the command was given
hermes thou chosen messenger of heaven
go to the nymph be these our orders borne
tis joves decree ulysses shall return
the patient man shall view his old abodes
nor helped by mortal hand nor guiding gods
in twice ten days shall fertile scheria find
alone and floating to the wave and wind
the bold phæacians there whose haughty line
is mixed with gods half human half divine
the chief shall honour as some heavenly guest
and swift transport him to his place of rest
his vessels loaded with a plenteous store
of brass of vestures and resplendent ore

his friends his country he shall see though late
such is our sovereign will and such is fate

he spoke the god who mounts the winged winds
fast to his feet the golden pinions binds
that high through fields of air his flight sustain
oer the wide earth and oer the boundless main
he grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly
or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye
then shoots from heaven to high pierias steep
and stoops incumbent on the rolling deep
so watery fowl that seek their fishy food
with wings expanded oer the foaming flood
now sailing smooth the level surface sweep
now dip their pinions in the briny deep
thus oer the world of waters hermes flew
till now the distant island rose in view
then swift ascending from the azure wave
he took the path that winded to the cave
large was the grot in which the nymph he found

the cave was brightend with a rising blaze
cedar and frankincense an odorous pile
flamed on the hearth and wide perfumed the isle
while she with work and song the time divides
and through the loom the golden shuttle guides
without the grot a various sylvan scene
appeard around and groves of living green
poplars and alders ever quivering playd
and nodding cypress formd a fragrant shade
on whose high branches waving with the storm
the birds of broadest wing their mansions form
the chough the seamew the loquacious crow
and scream aloft and skim the deeps below
depending vines the shelving cavern screen
with purple clusters blushing through the green
four limpid fountains from the clefts distil
and every fountain pours a several rill
in mazy windings wandering down the hill
where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crownd
and glowing violets threw odours round
a scene where if a god should cast his sight
a god might gaze and wander with delight
joy touchd the messenger of heaven he stayd
entranced and all the blissful haunts surveyed
him entering in the cave calypso knew
for powers celestial to each others view
stand still confessd though distant far they lie
to habitants of earth or sea or sky
but sad ulysses by himself apart
pourd the big sorrows of his swelling heart
all on the lonely shore he sate to weep
and rolld his eyes around the restless deep
toward his loved coast he rolld his eyes in vain
till dimmd with rising grief they streamd again

now graceful seated on her shining throne
to hermes thus the nymph divine begun

god of the golden wand on what behest
arrivest thou here an unexpected guest
loved as thou art thy free injunctions lay
tis mine with joy and duty to obey
till now a stranger in a happy hour
approach and taste the dainties of my bower

thus having spoke the nymph the table spread

hermes the hospitable rite partook
divine refection then recruited spoke

what moves this journey from my native sky
a goddess asks nor can a god deny
hear then the truth by mighty joves command
unwilling have i trod this pleasing land
for who selfmoved with weary wing would sweep
such length of ocean and unmeasured deep
a world of waters far from all the ways
where men frequent or sacred altars blaze
but to joves will submission we must pay
what power so great to dare to disobey
a man he says a man resides with thee
of all his kind most worn with misery
the greeks 
at length embarking in a luckless hour
with conquest proud incensed minervas power
hence on the guilty race her vengeance hurld
with storms pursued them through the liquid world
there all his vessels sunk beneath the wave
there all his dear companions found their grave
saved from the jaws of death by heavens decree
the tempest drove him to these shores and thee
him jove now orders to his native lands
straight to dismiss so destiny commands
impatient fate his near return attends
and calls him to his country and his friends

een to her inmost soul the goddess shook
then thus her anguish and her passion broke
ungracious gods with spite and envy cursed
still to your own ethereal race the worst
ye envy mortal and immortal joy
and love the only sweet of life destroy
did ever goddess by her charms engage
a favourd mortal and not feel your rage
so when aurora sought orions love
her joys disturbed your blissful hours above
till in ortygia dians winged dart
had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart
so when the covert of the thriceeared field
saw stately ceres to her passion yield
scarce could iasion taste her heavenly charms
but joves swift lightning scorched him in her arms
and is it now my turn ye mighty powers
am i the envy of your blissful bowers
a man an outcast to the storm and wave
it was my crime to pity and to save
when he who thunders rent his bark in twain
and sunk his brave companions in the main
alone abandond in midocean tossed
the sport of winds and driven from every coast
hither this man of miseries i led
received the friendless and the hungry fed
nay promised  to bestow
immortal life exempt from age and woe
tis pastand jove decrees he shall remove
gods as we are we are but slaves to jove
go then he must 
but never never shall calypso send
to toils like these her husband and her friend
what ships have i what sailors to convey
what oars to cut the long laborious way
yet ill direct the safest means to go
that last advice is all i can bestow

to her the power who hears the charming rod
dismiss the man nor irritate the god
prevent the rage of him who reigns above
for what so dreadful as the wrath of jove
thus having said he cut the cleaving sky
and in a moment vanished from her eye
the nymph obedient to divine command
to seek ulysses paced along the sand
him pensive on the lonely beach she found
with streaming eyes in briny torrents drownd
and inly pining for his native shore
for now the soft enchantress pleased no more
for now reluctant and constrained by charms
absent he lay in her desiring arms
in slumber wore the heavy night away
on rocks and shores consumed the tedious day
there sate all desolate and sighed alone
with echoing sorrows made the mountains groan
and rolld his eyes oer all the restless main
till dimmed with rising grief they streamed again

here on his musing mood the goddess pressd
approaching soft and thus the chief addressd
unhappy man to wasting woes a prey
no more in sorrows languish life away
free as the winds i give thee now to rove
go fell the timber of yon lofty grove
and form a raft and build the rising ship
sublime to bear thee oer the gloomy deep
to store the vessel let the care be mine
with water from the rock and rosy wine
and lifesustaining bread and fair array
and prosperous gales to waft thee on the way
these if the gods with my desire comply

in peace shall land thee at thy native home

with sighs ulysses heard the words she spoke
then thus his melancholy silence broke
some other motive goddess sways thy mind

nor my return the end nor this the way
on a slight raft to pass the swelling sea
huge horrid vast where scarce in safety sails
the bestbuilt ship though jove inspires the gales
the bold proposal how shall i fulfil
dark as i am unconscious of thy will
swear then thou meanst not what my soul forebodes
swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods

him while he spoke with smiles calypso eyed
and gently graspd his hand and thus replied
this shows thee friend by old experience taught
and learnd in all the wiles of human thought
how prone to doubt how cautious are the wise
but hear o earth and hear ye sacred skies
and thou o styx whose formidable floods
glide through the shades and bind the attesting gods
no formd design no meditated end
lurks in the counsel of thy faithful friend
kind the persuasion and sincere my aim
the same my practice were my fate the same
heaven has not cursed me with a heart of steel
but given the sense to pity and to feel

thus having said the goddess marched before
he trod her footsteps in the sandy shore
at the cool cave arrived they took their state
he filled the throne where mercury had sate
for him the nymph a rich repast ordains
such as the mortal life of man sustains
before herself were placed the the cates divine
ambrosial banquet and celestial wine
their hunger satiate and their thirst repressd
thus spoke calypso to her godlike guest

ulysses 
o sprung from gods in wisdom more than man
is then thy home the passion of thy heart
thus wilt thou leave me are we thus to part
farewell and ever joyful mayst thou be
nor break the transport with one thought of me
but ah ulysses wert thou given to know
what fate yet dooms these still to undergo
thy heart might settle in this scene of ease
and een these slighted charms might learn to please
a willing goddess and immortal life
might banish from thy mind an absent wife
am i inferior to a mortal dame
less soft my feature less august my frame
or shall the daughters of mankind compare
their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair

alas for this 
against ulysses shall thy anger rise
loved and adored o goddess as thou art
forgive the weakness of a human heart
though well i see thy graces far above
the dear though mortal object of my love
of youth eternal well the difference know
and the short date of fading charms below
yet every day while absent thus i roam
i languish to return and die at home
whateer the gods shall destine me to bear
in the black ocean or the watery war
tis mine to master with a constant mind
inured to perils to the worst resignd
by seas by wars so many dangers run
still i can suffer their high will he done

thus while he spoke the beamy sun descends
and rising night her friendly shade extends
to the close grot the lonely pair remove
and slept delighted with the gifts of love
when rosy morning calld them from their rest
ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest
the nymphs fair head a veil transparent graced
her swelling loins a radiant zone embraced
with flowers of gold an under robe unbound
in snowy waves flowd glittering on the ground
forth issuing thus she gave him first to wield
a weighty axe with truest temper steeled
and doubleedged the handle smooth and plain
wrought of the clouded olives easy grain
and next a wedge to drive with sweepy sway
then to the neighboring forest led the way
on the lone islands utmost verge there stood
of poplars pine and firs a lofty wood
whose leafless summits to the skies aspire
scorchd by the sun or seared by heavenly fire
 these pointing out to view
the nymph just showd him and with tears withdrew

now toils the hero trees on trees oerthrown
fall crackling round him and the forests groan
sudden full twenty on the plain are strowd
and loppd and lightend of their branchy load
at equal angles these disposed to join
he smoothd and squared them by the rule and line

with those he pierced them and with clinchers bound
long and capacious as a shipwright forms
some barks broad bottom to outride the storms
so large he built the raft then ribbd it strong
from space to space and naild the planks along
these formd the sides the deck he fashiond last
then oer the vessel raised the taper mast
with crossing sailyards dancing in the wind
and to the helm the guiding rudder joind

thy loom calypso for the future sails
supplied the cloth capacious of the gales
with stays and cordage last he rigged the ship
and rolld on levers launchd her in the deep

four days were passd and now the work complete
shone the fifth morn when from her sacred seat
the nymph dismissd him 
and bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven
then filld two goatskins with her hands divine
with water one and one with sable wine
of every kind provisions heaved aboard
and the full decks with copious viands stored
the goddess last a gentle breeze supplies
to curl old ocean and to warm the skies

and now rejoicing in the prosperous gales
with beating heart ulysses spreads his sails
placed at the helm he sate and markd the skies
nor closed in sleep his everwatchful eyes
there viewd the pleiads and the northern team
and great orions more refulgent beam
to which around the axle of the sky
the bear revolving points his golden eye
who shines exalted on the ethereal plain
nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main
far on the left those radiant fires to keep
the nymph directed as he saild the deep
full seventeen nights he cut the foaming way
the distant land appeard the following day
then swelld to sight phæacias dusky coast
and woody mountains half in vapours lost
that lay before him indistinct and vast
like a broad shield amid the watery waste

but him thus voyaging the deeps below
from far on solymes aërial brow
the king of ocean saw and seeing burnd

the raging monarch shook his azure head
and thus in secret to his soul he said
heavens how uncertain are the powers on high
is then reversed the sentence of the sky
in one mans favour while a distant guest
i shared secure the æthiopian feast
behold how near phæacias land he draws
the land affixd by fates eternal laws
to end his toils is then our anger vain
no if this sceptre yet commands the main

he spoke and high the forky trident hurld
rolls clouds on clouds and stirs the watery world
at once the face of earth and sea deforms
swells all the winds and rouses all the storms
down rushed the night east west together roar
and south and north roll mountains to the shore
then shook the hero to despair resignd
and questiond thus his yet unconquerd mind

wretch that i am what farther fates attend
this life of toils and what my destined end
too well alas the island goddess knew
on the black sea what perils should ensue
new horrors now this destined head inclose
untilld is yet the measure of my woes
with what a cloud the brows of heaven are crownd
what raging winds what roaring waters round
tis jove himself the swelling tempest rears
death present death on every side appears
happy thrice happy who in battle slain
pressd in atrides cause the trojan plain
oh had i died before that wellfought wall
had some distinguishd day renownd my fall

all greece had paid me solemn funerals then
and spread my glory with the sons of men
a shameful fate now hides my hapless head
unwept unnoted and for ever dead

a mighty wave rushd oer him as he spoke
the raft is coverd and the mast is broke
swept from the deck and from the rudder torn
far on the swelling surge the chief was borne
while by the howling tempest rent in twain
flew sail and sailyards rattling oer the main
longpressd he heaved beneath the weighty wave
cloggd by the cumbrous vest calypso gave
at length emerging from his nostrils wide
and gushing mouth effused the briny tide
een then not mindless of his last retreat
he seized the raft and leapd into his seat
strong with the fear of death in rolling flood
now here now there impelld the floating wood
as when a heap of gatherd thorns is cast
now to now fro before the autumnal blast
together clung it rolls around the field
so rolld the float and so its texture held
and now the south and now the north bear sway
and now the east the foamy floods obey
and now the west wind whirls it oer the sea
the wandering chief with toils on toils oppressd
leucothea saw and pity touchd her breast

swift as a seamew springing from the flood
all radiant on the raft the goddess stood
then thus addressd him thou whom heaven decrees
to neptunes wrath stern tyrant of the seas
 not his rage and power
great as he is such virtue shall devour
what i suggest thy wisdom will perform
forsake thy float and leave it to the storm
strip off thy garments neptunes fury brave
with naked strength and plunge into the wave
to reach phæacia all thy nerves extend
there fate decrees thy miseries shall end
this heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind
and live give all thy terrors to the wind
soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain
return the gift and cast it in the main
observe my orders and with heed obey
cast it far off and turn thy eyes away

with that her hand the sacred veil bestows
then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose
a moment snatchd the shining form away
and all was covered with the curling sea

struck with amaze yet still to doubt inclined
he stands suspended and explores his mind
what shall i do unhappy me who knows
but other gods intend me other woes
whoeer thou art i shall not blindly join
thy pleaded reason but consult with mine
for scarce in ken appears that distant isle
thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil
thus then i judge while yet the planks sustain
the wild waves fury here i fixd remain
but when their texture to the tempest yields
i launch adventurous on the liquid fields
join to the help of gods the strength of man
and take this method since the best i can

while thus his thoughts an anxious council hold
the raging god a watery mountain rolld
like a black sheet the whelming billows spread
burst oer the float and thunderd on his head
planks beams disparted fly the scatterd wood
rolls diverse and in fragments strews the flood
so the rude boreas oer the field newshorn
tosses and drives the scatterd heaps of corn
and now a single beam the chief bestrides
there poised a while above the bounding tides
his limbs discumbers of the clinging vest
and binds the sacred cincture round his breast
then prone an ocean in a moment flung
stretchd wide his eager arms and shot the seas along
all naked now on heaving billows laid
stern neptune eyed him and contemptuous said

go learnd in woes and other foes essay
go wander helpless on the watery way
thus thus find out the destined shore and then
 mix with happier men
whateer thy fate the ills our wrath could raise
shall last rememberd in thy best of days

this said his seagreen steeds divide the foam
and reach high ægæ and the towery dome
now scarce withdrawn the fierce earthshaking power
joves daughter pallas watchd the favouring hour
back to their caves she bade the winds to fly
and hushd the blustering brethren of the sky
the drier blasts alone of boreas away
and bear him soft on broken waves away
with gentle force impelling to that shore
where fate has destined he shall toil no more
and now two nights and now two days were passd
since wide he wanderd on the watery waste
heaved on the surge with intermitting breath
and hourly panting in the arms of death
the third fair morn now blazed upon the main
then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain
the winds were hushd the billows scarcely curld
and a dead silence stilld the watery world
when lifted on a ridgy wave he spies
the land at distance and with sharpend eyes
as pious children joy with vast delight
when a loved sire revives before their sight

so joys ulysses at the appearing shore
and sees 
the rising forests and the tufted trees
and now as near approaching as the sound
of human voice the listening ear may wound
amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar
of murmuring surges breaking on the shore
nor peaceful port was there nor winding bay
to shield the vessel from the rolling sea
but cliffs and shaggy shores a dreadful sight
all rough with rocks with foamy billows white
fear seized his slackend limbs and beating heart
as thus he communed with his soul apart

ah me when oer a length of waters tossd
these eyes at last behold the unhopedfor coast
no port receives me from the angry main
but the loud deeps demand me back again
above sharp rocks forbid access around
roar the wild waves beneath is sea profound
no footing sure affords the faithless sand
to stem too rapid and too deep to stand
if here i enter my efforts are vain
dashd on the cliffs or heaved into the main
or round the island if my course i bend
where the ports open or the shores descend
back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep
and bury all my hopes beneath the deep
or some enormous whale the god may send

too well the turns of mortal chance i know
and hate relentless of my heavenly foe
while thus he thought a monstrous wave upbore
the chief and dashd him on the craggy shore
torn was his skin nor had the ribs been whole
but instant pallas enterd in his soul
close to the cliff with both his hands he clung
and stuck adherent and suspended hung
till the huge surge rolld off then backward sweep
the refluent tides and plunge him in the deep
as when the polypus from forth his cave
torn with full force reluctant beats the wave
his ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands
so the rough rock had shaggd ulysses hands
and now had perishd whelmd beneath the main
the unhappy man een fate had been in vain
but allsubduing pallas lent her power
and prudence saved him in the needful hour
beyond the beating surge his course he bore

with longing eyes observing to survey
some smooth ascent or safe sequesterd bay
between the parting rocks at length he spied
a failing stream with gentler waters glide
where to the seas the shelving shore declined
and formd a bay impervious to the wind
to this calm port the glad ulysses pressd
and haild the river and its god addressd

whoeer thou art before whose stream unknown
i bend a suppliant at thy watery throne
hear azure king nor let me fly in vain
to thee from neptune and the raging main
heaven hears and pities hapless men like me
for sacred even to gods is misery
let then thy waters give the weary rest
and save a suppliant and a man distressd

he prayd and straight the gentle stream subsides
detains the rushing current of his tides
before the wanderer smooths the watery way
and soft receives him from the rolling sea
that moment fainting as he touchd the shore
he droppd his sinewy arms his knees no more
performd their office or his weight upheld
his swoln heart heaved his bloated body swelld
from mouth and nose the briny torrent ran
and lost in lassitude lay all the man
deprived of voice of motion and of breath
the soul scarce waking in the arms of death
soon as warm life its wonted office found
the mindful chief leucotheas scarf unbound
observant of her word he turnd aside
his head and cast it on the rolling tide
behind him far upon the purple waves
the waters waft it and the nymph receives

now parting from the stream ulysses found
a mossy bank with pliant rushes crownd
the bank he pressd and gently kissd the ground
where on the flowery herb as soft he lay
thus to his soul the sage began to say

what will ye next ordain ye powers on high
and yet ah yet what fates are we to try
here by the stream if i the night outwear
thus spent already how shall nature bear
the dews descending and nocturnal air
or chilly vapours breathing from the flood
when morning risesif i take the wood
and in thick shelter of innumerous boughs
enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows
though fenced from cold and though my toil be passd
what savage beasts may wander in the waste
perhaps i yet may fall a bloody prey
to prowling bears or lions in the way

thus long debating in himself he stood
at length he took the passage to the wood
whose shady horrors on a rising brow
waved high and frownd upon the stream below
there grew two olives closest of the grove
with roots entwined the branches interwove
alike their leaves but not alike they smiled
with sisterfruits one fertile one was wild
nor here the suns meridian rays had power
nor wind sharppiercing nor the rushing shower
the verdant arch so close its texture kept
beneath this covert great ulysses crept
of gatherd leaves an ample bed he made

where three at least might winters cold defy
though boreas raged along the inclement sky
this store with joy the patient hero found
and sunk amidst them heapd the leaves around
as some poor peasant fated to reside
remote from neighbours in a forest wide
studious to save what human wants require
in embers heapd preserves the seeds of fire
hid in dry foliage thus ulysses lies
till pallas pourd soft slumbers on his eyes
and golden dreams 
lulld all his cares and banishd all his woes







while thus the weary wanderer sunk to rest
and peaceful slumbers calmed his anxious breast
the martial maid from heavens aërial height
swift to phæacia wingd her rapid flight
in elder times the soft phæacian train
in ease possessd the wide hyperian plain
till the cyclopean race in arms arose
a lawless nation of gigantic foes
then great nausithous from hyperia far
through seas retreating from the sounds of war
the recreant nation to fair scheria led
where never science reard her laurelld head
there round his tribes a strength of wall he raised
to heaven the glittering domes and temples blazed
just to his realms he parted grounds from grounds
and shared the lands and gave the lands their bounds
now in the silent grave the monarch lay
and wise alcinous held the legal sway

to his high palace through the fields of air
the goddess shot ulysses was her care
there as the night in silence rolld away
a heaven of charms divine nausicaa lay
through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze
two nymphs the portals guard each nymph a grace
light as the viewless air the warrior maid
glides through the valves and hovers round her head
a favourite virgins blooming form she took
from dymas sprung and thus the vision spoke

oh indolent to waste thy hours away
and sleepst thou careless of the bridal day
thy spousal ornament neglected lies
arise prepare the bridal train arise
a just applause the cares of dress impart
and give soft transport to a parents heart
haste to the limpid stream direct thy way
when the gay morn unveils her smiling ray
haste to the stream companion of thy care
lo i thy steps attend thy labours share
virgin awake the marriage hour is nigh
see from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh
the royal car at early dawn obtain
and order mules obedient to the rein
for rough the way and distant rolls the wave
where their fair vests phæacian virgins lave
in pomp ride forth for pomp becomes the great
and majesty derives a grace from state
then to the palaces of heaven she sails
incumbent on the wings of wafting gales
the seat of gods the regions mild of peace
full joy and calm eternity of ease
there no rude winds presume to shake the skies
no rains descend no snowy vapours rise
but on immortal thrones the blest repose
the firmament with living splendours glows
hither the goddess winged the aërial way
through heavens eternal gates that blazed with day

now from her rosy car aurora shed
the dawn and all the orient flamed with red
up rose the virgin with the morning light
obedient to the vision of the night
the queen she sought the queen her hours bestowed
in curious works the whirling spindle glowd
with crimson threads while busy damsels call
the snowy fleece or twist the purpled wool
meanwhile phæacias peers in council sate
from his high dome the king descends in state
then with a filial awe the royal maid
approachd him passing and submissive said

will my dread sire his ear regardful deign
and may his child the royal car obtain
say with my garments shall i bend my way
where through the vales the mazy waters stray
a dignity of dress adorns the great
and kings draw lustre from the robe of state
five sons thou hast three wait the bridal day
and spotless robes become the young and gay
so when with praise amid the dance they shine
by these my cares adornd that praise is mine

thus she but blushes illrestraind betray
her thoughts intentive on the bridal day
the conscious sire the dawning blush surveyd
and smiling thus bespoke the blooming maid
my child my darling joy the car receive
that and whateer our daughter asks we give
swift at the royal nod the attending train
the car prepare the mules incessant rein
the blooming virgin with despatchful cares
tunics and stoles and robes imperial bears
the queen assiduous to her train assigns
the sumptuous viands and the flavorous wines
the train prepare a cruse of curious mould
a cruse of fragrance formd of burnishd gold
odour divine whose soft refreshing streams
sleek the smooth skin and scent the snowy limbs

now mounting the gay seat the silken reins
shine in her hand along the sounding plains
swift fly the mules nor rode the nymph alone
around a bevy of bright damsels shone
they seek the cisterns where phæacian dames
wash their fair garments in the limpid streams
where gathering into depth from falling rills
the lucid wave a spacious bason fills
the mules unharnessd range beside the main
or crop the verdant herbage of the plain

then emulous the royal robes they lave
and plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave

then with a short repast relieve their toil
and oer their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil
and while the robes imbibe the solar ray
oer the green mead the sporting virgins play
 along the skies
tossd and retossd the ball incessant flies
they sport they feast nausicaa lifts her voice
and warbling sweet makes earth and heaven rejoice

as when oer erymanth diana roves
or wide täygetus resounding groves
a sylvan train the huntress queen surrounds
her rattling quiver from her shoulders sounds
fierce in the sport along the mountains brow
they bay the boar or chase the bounding roe
high oer the lawn with more majestic pace
above the nymphs she treads with stately grace
distinguishd excellence the goddess proves
exults latona as the virgin moves
with equal grace nausicaa trod the plain
and shone transcendent oer the beauteous train

meantime  or with keen hunger bold
spring oer the fence and dissipates the fold
no less a terror from the neighbouring groves
 ulysses moves
urged on by want and recent from the storms
the brackish ooze his manly grace deforms
wide oer the shore with many a piercing cry
to rocks to caves the frightened virgins fly
all but the nymph the nymph stood fixd alone
by pallas armd with boldness not her own
meantime in dubious thought the king awaits
and selfconsidering as he stands debates
distant his mournful story to declare
or prostrate at her knee address the prayer
but fearful to offend by wisdom swayd
at awful distance he accosts the maid

if from the skies a goddess or if earth
 boast thy glorious birth
to thee i bend if in that bright disguise
thou visit earth a daughter of the skies
hail dian hail the huntress of the groves
so shines majestic and so stately moves
so breathes an air divine but if thy race
be mortal and this earth thy native place
blest is the father from whose loins you sprung
blest is the mother at whose breast you hung
blest are the brethren who thy blood divide
to such a miracle of charms allied
joyful they see applauding princes gaze
when stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze
but blest oer all the youth with heavenly charms
who clasps the bright perfection in his arms
never i never viewd till this blest hour
such finishd grace i gaze and i adore
thus seems the palm with stately honours crownd
by phœbus altars thus oerlooks the ground
the pride of delos 
raptured i stood and as this hour amazed
with reverence at the lofty wonder gazed
raptured i stand for earth neer knew to bear
a plant so stately or a nymph so fair
awed from access i lift my suppliant hands
for misery o queen before thee stands
twice ten tempestuous nights i rolld resignd
to roaring billows and the warring wind
heaven bade the deep to spare but heaven my foe
spares only to inflict some mightier woe
inured to cares to death in all its forms
outcast i rove familiar with the storms
once more i view the face of human kind
oh let soft pity touch thy generous mind
unconscious of what air i breathe i stand
naked defenceless on a narrow land
propitious to my wants a vest supply
to guard the wretched from the inclement sky
so may the gods who heaven and earth control
crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul
on thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed
blest with a husband be thy bridal bed
blest be thy husband with a blooming race
and lasting union crown your blissful days
the gods when they supremely bless bestow
firm union on their favourites below
then envy grieves with inlypining hate
the good exult and heaven is in our state

to whom the nymph o stranger cease thy care
wise is thy soul but man is born to bear
jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales
and the good suffers while the bad prevails
bear with a soul resignd the will of jove
who breathes must mourn thy woes are from above
but since thou treadst our hospitable shore
tis mine to bid the wretched grieve no more
to clothe the naked and thy way to guide
know the phæacian tribes this land divide
from great alcinous royal loins i spring
a happy nation and a happy king

then to her maids why why ye coward train
these fears this flight ye fear and fly in vain
dread ye a foe dismiss that idle dread
tis death with hostile step these shores to tread
safe in the love of heaven an ocean flows
around our realm a barrier from the foes
tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve
cheer the sad heart nor let affliction grieve
by jove the stranger and the poor are sent
and what to those we give to jove is lent
then food supply and bathe his fainting limbs
where waving shades obscure the mazy streams

obedient to the call the chief they guide
to the calm current of the secret tide
close by the stream a royal dress they lay
a vest and robe with rich embroidery gay
then unguents in a vase of gold supply
that breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky

to them the king no longer i detain
your friendly care retire ye virgin train
retire while from my wearied limbs i lave
the foul pollution of the briny wave
ye gods since this worn frame refection knew
what scenes have i surveyed of dreadful view
but nymphs recede sage chastity denies
to raise the blush or pain the modest eyes

the nymphs withdrawn at once into the tide
active he bounds the flashing waves divide
oer all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse
and from his locks compress the weedy ooze
the balmy oil a fragrant shower be sheds
then dressed in pomp magnificently treads
the warriorgoddess gives his frame to shine
with majesty enlarged and air divine
back from his brows a length of hair unfurls
his hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls
as by some artist to whom vulcan gives
his skill divine a breathing statue lives
by pallas taught he frames the wondrous mould
and oer the silver pours the fusile gold
so pallas his heroic frame improves
with heavenly bloom and like a god he moves
a fragrance breathes around majestic grace
attends his steps the astonished virgins gaze
soft he reclines along the murmuring seas
inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze

the wondering nymph his glorious port surveyd
and to her damsels with amazement said

not without care divine the stranger treads
this land of joy his steps some godhead leads
would jove destroy him sure he had been driven
far from this realm the favourite isle of heaven
late a sad spectacle of woe he trod
the desert sands and now he looks a god
oh heaven in my connubial hour decree
this man my spouse or such a spouse as he
but haste the viands and the bowl provide
the maids the viands and the bowl supplied
eager he fed for keen his hunger raged
and with the generous vintage thirst assuaged

now on return her care nausicaa bends
the robes resumes the glittering car ascends
far blooming oer the field and as she pressd
the splendid seat the listening chief addressd

stranger arise the sun rolls down the day
lo to the palace i direct thy way
where in high state the nobles of the land
attend my royal sire a radiant band
but hear though wisdom in thy soul presides
speaks from thy tongue and every action guides
advance at distance while i pass the plain
where oer the furrows waves the golden grain
alone i reascendwith airy mounds
a strength of wall the guarded city bounds
the jutting land two ample bays divides
full through the narrow mouths descend the tides
the spacious basons arching rocks enclose
a sure defence from every storm that blows
close to the bay great neptunes fane adjoins
and near a forum flankd with marble shines
where the bold youth the numerous fleets to store
shape the broad sail or smooth the taper oar
for not the bow they bend nor boast the skill
to give the featherd arrow wings to kill
but the tall mast above the vessel rear
or teach the fluttering sail to float in air
they rush into the deep with eager joy
climb the steep surge and through the tempest fly
a proud unpolishd raceto me belongs
the care to shun the blast of slanderous tongues
lest malice prone the virtuous to defame
thus with wild censure taint my spotless name
what stranger this whom thus nausicaa leads
heavens with what graceful majesty he treads
perhaps a native of some distant shore
the future consort of her bridal hour
or rather some descendant of the skies
won by her prayer the aërial bridegroom flies
heaven on that hour its choicest influence shed
that gave a foreign spouse to crown her bed
all all the godlike worthies that adorn
this realm she flies phæacia is her scorn
and just the blame for female innocence
not only flies the guilt but shuns the offence
the unguarded virgin as unchaste i blame
and the least freedom with the sex is shame
till our consenting sires a spouse provide
and public nuptials justify the bride
but wouldst thou soon review thy native plain
attend and speedy thou shalt pass the main
nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crownd
to pallas sacred shades the holy ground
we bend our way a bubbling fount distills
a lucid lake and thence descends in rills
around the grove a mead with lively green
falls by degrees and forms a beauteous scene
here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours
and there the garden yields a waste of flowers
hence lies the town as far as to the ear
floats a strong shout along the waves of air
there wait embowerd while i ascend alone
to great alcinous on his royal throne
arrived advance impatient of delay
and to the lofty palace bend thy way
the lofty palace overlooks the town
from every dome by pomp superior known
a child may point the way with earnest gait
seek thou the queen along the rooms of state
her royal hand a wondrous work designs
around a circle of bright damsels shines
part twist the threads and part the wool dispose
while with the purple orb the spindle glows
high on a throne amid the scherian powers
my royal father shares the genial hours
but to the queen thy mournful tale disclose
with the prevailing eloquence of woes
so shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore
though mountains rise between and oceans roar

she added not but waving as she wheeld
the silver scourge it glitterd oer the field
with skill the virgin guides the embroiderd rein
slow rolls the car before the attending train
now whirling down the heavens the golden day
shot through the western clouds a dewy ray
the grove they reach where from the sacred shade
to pallas thus the pensive hero prayd

daughter of jove whose arms in thunder wield
the avenging bolt and shake the dreadful shield
forsook by thee in vain i sought thy aid
when booming billows closed above my bead
attend unconquerd maid accord my vows
bid the great hear and pitying heal my woes

this heard minerva but forbore to fly
 apparent from the sky
stern god who raged with vengeance unrestraind
till great ulysses haild his native land







the patient heavenly man thus suppliant prayd
while the slow mules draws on the imperial maid
through the proud street she moves the public gaze
the turning wheel before the palace stays
with ready love her brothers gathering round
received the vestures and the mules unbound
she seeks the bridal bower a matron there
the rising fire supplies with busy care
whose charms in youth her fathers heart inflamed
now worn with age eurymedusa named
the captive dame phæacian rovers bore
snatchd from epirus her sweet native shore
 and in her bloom bestowd
on good alcinous honord as a god
nurse of nausicaa from her infant years
and tender second to a mothers cares

now from the sacred thicket where he lay
to town ulysses took the winding way
propitious pallas to secure her care
around him spread a veil of thickend air
to shun the encounter of the vulgar crowd
insulting still inquisitive and loud
when near the famed phæacian walls he drew
the beauteous city opening to his view
his step a virgin met and stood before
a polishd urn the seeming virgin bore
and youthful smiled but in the low disguise
lay hid the goddess with the azure eyes

show me fair daughter 
the house of him who rules these happy lands
through many woes and wanderings do i come
to good alcinous hospitable dome
far from my native coast i rove alone
a wretched stranger and of all unknown

the goddess answerd father i obey
and point the wandering traveller his way
well known to me the palace you inquire
for fast beside it dwells my honourd sire
but silent march nor greet the common train
with question needless or inquiry vain
a race of ragged mariners are these
unpolishd men and boisterous as their seas
the native islanders alone their care
and hateful he who breathes a foreign air
these did the ruler of the deep ordain
to build proud navies and command the main
on canvas wings to cut the watery way
no bird so light no thought so swift as they

thus having spoke the unknown celestial leads
the footsteps of the deity he treads
and secret moves along the crowded space
unseen of all the rude phæacian race

the chief with wonder sees the extended streets
the spreading harbours and the riding fleets
he next their princes lofty domes admires
in separate islands crownd with rising spires
and deep entrenchments and high walls of stone
that gird the city like a marble zone
at length the kingly palacegates he viewd
there stoppd the goddess and her speech renewd

my task is done the mansion you inquire
appears before you enter and admire
highthroned and feasting there thou shalt behold
the sceptred rulers fear not but be bold
a decent boldness ever meets with friends
succeeds and even a stranger recommends
first to the queen prefer a suppliants claim
alcinous queen arete is her name
the same her parents and her power the same
for know from oceans god nausithous sprung
and peribæa beautiful and young

who now by neptunes amorous power compressd
produced a monarch that his people blessd
father and prince of the phæacian name
from him rhexenor and alcinous came
the first by phœbus hurtling arrows fired
new from his nuptials hapless youth expired
no son survived arete heird his state
and her alcinous chose his royal mate
with honours yet to womankind unknown
this queen he graces and divides the throne
in equal tenderness her sons conspire
and all the children emulate their sire
when through the streets she gracious deigns to move

the tongues of all with transport sound her praise
the eyes of all as on a goddess gaze
she feels the triumph of a generous breast
to heal divisions to relieve the oppressd
in virtue rich in blessing others blessd

to thee thy consort and this royal train
to all that share the blessings of your reign
a suppliant bends oh pity human woe
tis what the happy to the unhappy owe
a wretched exile to his country send
long worn with griefs and long without a friend
so may the gods your better days increase
and all your joys descend on all your race
so reign for ever on your countrys breast
your people blessing by your people blessd

then to the genial hearth he bowd his face
and humbled in the ashes took his place
silence ensued the eldest first began
echeneus sage a venerable man
whose welltaught mind the present age surpassd
and joind to that the experience of the last
fit words attended on his weighty sense
and mild persuasion flowd in eloquence

oh sight  dishonest and unjust
a guest a stranger seated in the dust
to raise the lowly suppliant from the ground
befits a monarch lo the peers around
but wait thy word the gentle guest to grace
and seat him fair in some distinguishd place
let first the herald due libation pay
to jove who guides the wanderer on his way
then set the genial banquet in his view
and give the strangerguest a strangers due

his sage advice the listening king obeys
he stretchd his hand the prudent chief to raise
and from his seat laodamas removed

there next his side the godlike hero sate
with stars of silver shone the bed of state
the golden ewer a beauteous handmaid brings
replenishd from the cool translucent springs
whose polishd vase with copious streams supplies
a silver layer of capacious size
the table next in regal order spread
the glittering canisters are heapd with bread
viands of various kinds invite the taste
of choicest sort and savour rich repast
thus feasting high alcinous gave the sign
and bade the herald pour the rosy wine
let all around the due libation pay
to jove who guides the wanderer on his way

he said pontonous heard the kings command
the circling goblet moves from hand to hand
each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man
alcinous then with aspect mild began

princes and peers attend while we impart
to you the thoughts of no inhuman heart
now pleased and satiate from the social rite
repair we to the blessings of the night
but with the rising day assembled here
let all the elders of the land appear
pious observe our hospitable laws
and heaven propitiate in the strangers cause
then joind in council proper means explore
safe to transport him to the wishedfor shore

meantime nor harm nor anguish let him bear
this interval heaven trusts him to our care
but to his native land our charge resignd
heavens is his life to come and all the woes behind
then must he suffer what the fates ordain
for fate has wove the thread of life with pain
and twins een from the birth are misery and man
but if descended from the olympian bower
gracious approach us some immortal power
if in that form thou comest a guest divine
some high event the conscious gods design
as yet unbid they never graced our feast
the solemn sacrifice calld down the guest
then manifest of heaven the vision stood
and to our eyes familiar was the god
oft with some favourd traveller they stray
and shine before him all the desert way
with social intercourse and face to face
the friends and guardians of our pious race
so near approach we their celestial kind
by justice truth and probity of mind
as our dire neighbours of cyclopean birth
match in fierce wrong the giantsons of earth

let no such thought  possess the royal mind
alas a mortal like thyself am i
no glorious native of yon azure sky
in form ah how unlike their heavenly kind
how more inferior in the gifts of mind
alas a mortal most oppressd of those
whom fate has loaded with a weight of woes
by a sad train of miseries alone
distinguishd long and second now to none
by heavens high will compelld from shore to shore
with heavens high will prepared to suffer more
what histories of toil could i declare
but still longwearied nature wants repair
spent with fatigue and shrunk with pining fast
my craving bowels still require repast
howeer the noble suffering mind may grieve
its load of anguish and disdain to live
necessity demands our daily bread
hunger is insolent and will be fed
but finish oh ye peers what you propose
and let the morrows dawn conclude my woes
pleased will i suffer all the gods ordain
to see my soil my son my friends again
that view vouchsafed let instant death surprise
with everduring shade these happy eyes

the assembled peers with general praise approved
his pleaded reason and the suit he moved
each drinks a full oblivion of his cares
and to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs
ulysses in the regal walls alone
remaind beside him on a splendid throne
divine arete and alcinous shone
the queen on nearer view the guest surveyd
robd in the garments her own hands had made
not without wonder seen then thus began
her words addressing to the godlike man

camest thou hither wondrous stranger say
from lands remote and oer a length of sea
tell then whence art thou whence that princely air
and robes like these so recent and so fair

hard is the task o princess you impose

the long the mournful series to relate
of all my sorrows sent by heaven and fate
yet what you ask attend an island lies
beyond these tracts and under other skies
ogygia named in oceans watery arms
where dwells calypso dreadful in her charms
remote from gods or men she holds her reign
amid the terrors of a rolling main
me only me the hand of fortune bore
unblest to tread that interdicted shore
when jove tremendous in the sable deeps
launchd his red lightning at our scattered ships
then all my fleet and all my followers lost
sole on a plank on boiling surges tossd
heaven drove my wreck the ogygian isle to find
full nine days floating to the wave and wind
met by the goddess there with open arms
she bribed my stay with more than human charms
nay promised vainly promised to bestow
immortal life exempt from age and woe
but all her blandishments successless prove
to banish from my breast my countrys love
i stay reluctant seven continued years
and water her ambrosial couch with tears
the eighth she voluntary moves to part
or urged by jove or her own changeful heart
a raft was formed to cross the surging sea
herself supplied the stores and rich array
and gave the gales to waft me on my way
in seventeen days appeard your pleasing coast
and woody mountains half in vapours lost
joy touched my soul my soul was joyd in vain
for angry neptune roused the raging main
the wild winds whistle and the billows roar
the splitting raft the furious tempest tore
and storms vindictive intercept the shore
soon as their rage subsides the seas i brave
with naked force and shoot along the wave
to reach this isle but there my hopes were lost
the surge impelld me on a craggy coast
i chose the safer sea and chanced to find
a rivers mouth impervious to the wind
and clear of rocks i fainted by the flood
then took the shelter of the neighbouring wood
twas night and covered in the foliage deep
jove plunged my senses in the death of sleep
all night i slept oblivious of my pain
aurora dawned and phœbus shined in vain
nor till oblique he sloped his evening ray
had somnus dried the balmy dews away
then female voices from the shore i heard
a maid amidst them goddesslike appeard
to her i sued she pitied my distress
like thee in beauty nor in virtue less
who from such youth could hope considerate care
in youth and beauty wisdom is but rare
she gave me life relieved with just supplies
my wants and lent these robes that strike your eyes
this is the truth and oh ye powers on high
forbid that want should sink me to a lie

to this the king our daughter but expressd
her cares imperfect to our godlike guest
suppliant to her since first he chose to pray
why not herself did she conduct the way
and with her handmaids to our court convey

hero and king 
nor blame her faultless nor suspect of pride
she bade me follow in the attendant train
but fear and reverence did my steps detain
lest rash suspicion might alarm thy mind
mans of a jealous and mistaken kind

far from my soul  the gods efface
all wrath illgrounded and suspicion base
whateer is honest stranger i approve
and would to phœbus pallas and to jove
such as thou art thy thought and mine were one
nor thou unwilling to be called my son
in such alliance couldst thou wish to join
a palace stored with treasures should be thine
but if reluctant who shall force thy stay
jove bids to set the stranger on his way
and ships shall wait thee with the morning ray
till then let slumber cross thy careful eyes
the wakeful mariners shall watch the skies
and seize the moment when the breezes rise
then gently waft thee to the pleasing shore
where thy soul rests and labour is no more
far as euboea though thy country lay
our ships with ease transport thee in a day
thither of old earths giant son to view
on wings of wind with rhadamanth they flew
this land from whence their morning course begun
saw them returning with the setting sun
your eyes shall witness and confirm my tale
our youth how dexterous and how fleet our sail
when justly timed with equal sweep they row
and ocean whitens in long tracks below

thus he no word the experienced man replies
but thus to heaven 
o jove o father what the king accords
do thou make perfect sacred be his words
wide oer the world alcinous glory shine
let fame be his and ah my country mine

meantime arete for the hour of rest
ordains the fleecy couch and covering vest
bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare
and the thick carpets spread with busy care
with torches blazing in their hands they passd
and finishd all their queens command with haste
then gave the signal to the willing guest
he rose with pleasure and retired to rest
there soft extended to the murmuring sound
of the high porch ulysses sleeps profound
within released from cares alcinous lies
and fast beside were closed aretes eyes




book viii


alcinous calls a council in which it is resolved to transport ulysses
into his country after which splendid entertainments are made where
the celebrated musician and poet demodocus plays and sings to the
guests they next proceed to the games the race the wrestling
discus c where ulysses casts a prodigious length to the admiration
of all the spectators they return again to the banquet and demodocus
sings the loves of mars and venus ulysses after a compliment to the
poet desires him to sing the introduction of the wooden horse into
troy which subject provoking his tears alcinous inquires of his guest
his name parentage and fortunes


now fair aurora lifts her golden ray
and all the ruddy orient flames with day
alcinous and the chief with dawning light
rose instant from the slumbers of the night
then to the councilseat they bend their way
and fill the shining thrones along the bay

meanwhile minerva in her guardian care
shoots from the starry vault through fields of air
in form a herald of the king she flies
from peer to peer and thus incessant cries

nobles and chiefs who rule phæacias states
the king in council your attendance waits
a prince of grace divine your aid implores
oer unknown seas arrived from unknown shores

she spoke and sudden with tumultuous sounds
of thronging multitudes the shore rebounds
at once the seats they fill and every eye
glazed as before some brother of the sky
pallas with grace divine his form improves
more high he treads and more enlarged he moves
she sheds celestial bloom regard to draw
and gives a dignity of mien to awe
with strength the future prize of fame to play
and gather all the honours of the day

then from his glittering throne alcinous rose
attend  while we our will disclose
your present aid this godlike stranger craves
tossd by rude tempest through a war of waves
perhaps from realms that view the rising day
or nations subject to the western ray
then grant what here all sons of woe obtain

be chosen youth prepared expert to try
the vast profound and bid the vessel fly
launch the tall back and order every oar
then in our court indulge the genial hour
instant you sailors to this task attend
swift to the palace all ye peers ascend
let none to strangers honours due disclaim
be there demodocus the bard of fame
taught by the gods to please when high he sings
the vocal lay responsive to the strings

thus spoke the prince the attending peers obey
in state they move alcinous heads the way
swift to demodocus the herald flies
at once the sailors to their charge arise
they launch the vessel and unfurl the sails
and stretch the swelling canvas to the gales
then to the palace move a gathering throng
youth and white age tumultuous pour along
now all accesses to the dome are filld
eight boars the choicest of the herd are killd
two beeves twelve fatlings from the flock they bring
to crown the feast so wills the bounteous king
the herald now arrives and guides along
the sacred master of celestial song
dear to the muse who gave his days to flow
with mighty blessings mixd with mighty woe
with clouds of darkness quenchd his visual ray
but gave him skill to raise the lofty lay
high on a radiant throne sublime in state
encircled by huge multitudes he sate
with silver shone the throne his lyre well strung
to rapturous sounds at hand poutonous hung
before his seat a polishd table shines
and a full goblet foams with generous wines
his food a herald bore and now they fed
and now the rage of craving hunger fled

then fired by all the muse aloud he sings
the mighty deeds of demigods and kings
from that fierce wrath the noble song arose
that made ulysses and achilles foes
how oer the feast they doom the fall of troy
the stern debate atrides hears with joy
for heaven foretold the contest when he trod
the marble threshold of the delphic god
curious to learn the counsels of the sky
ere yet he loosed the rage of war on troy

touchd at the song ulysses straight resignd
to soft affliction all his manly mind
before his eyes the purple vest he drew
industrious to conceal the falling dew
but when the music paused he ceased to shed
the flowing tear and raised his drooping head
and lifting to the gods a goblet crownd
he pourd a pure libation to the ground

transported with the song the listening train
again with loud applause demand the strain
again ulysses veild his pensive head
again unmannd a shower of sorrows shed
conceald he wept the king observed alone
the silent tear and heard the secret groan
then to the bard aloudo cease to sing
dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string
enough the feast has pleased enough the power
of heavenly song has crownd the genial hour
incessant in the games your strength display
contest ye brave the honours of the day
that pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim
in distant regions the phæacian fame
none wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway
or swifter in the race devour the way
none in the leap spring with so strong a bound
or firmer in the wrestling press the ground

thus spoke the king the attending peers obey
in state they move alcinous lends the way
his golden lyre demodocus unstrung
high on a column in the palace hung
and guided by a heralds guardian cares
majestic to the lists of fame repairs

now swarms the populace a countless throng
youth and hoar age and man drives man along
the games begin ambitious of the prize
acroneus thoon and eretmeus rise
the prize ocyalus and prymneus claim
anchialus and ponteus chiefs of fame
there proreus nautes eratreus appear
and famed amphialus polyneus heir
euryalus like mars terrific rose
when clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes
naubolides with grace unequalld shone
or equalld by laodamas alone
with these came forth ambasineus the strong
and three brave sons from great alcinous sprung

ranged in a line the ready racers stand
start from the goal and vanish oer the strand
swift as on wings of winds upborne they fly
and drifts of rising dust involve the sky
before the rest what space the hinds allow
between the mule and ox from plough to plough
clytonius sprung he wingd the rapid way
and bore the unrivalld honours of the day
with fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join
the conquest great euryalus is thine
amphialus sprung forward with a bound
superior in the leap a length of ground
from elatreus strong arm the discus flies
and sings with unmatchd force along the skies
and laodam whirls high with dreadful sway
the gloves of death victorious in the fray

while thus the peerage in the games contends
in act to speak laodamas ascends

o friends  the stranger seems well skilld
to try the illustrious labours of the field
i deem him brave then grant the brave mans claim
invite the hero to his share of fame
what nervous arms he boasts how firm his tread
his limbs how turnd how broad his shoulders spread
by age unbrokebut allconsuming care
destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare
dire is the ocean dread in all its forms
man must decay when man contends with storms

well hast thou spoke 
thine is the guest invite him thou to rise
swift as the word advancing from the crowd
he made obeisance and thus spoke aloud

vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display
his manly worth and share the glorious day
father arise for thee thy port proclaims
expert to conquer in the solemn games
to fame arise for what more fame can yield
than the swift race or conflict of the field
steal from corroding care one transient day
to glory give the space thou hast to stay
short is the time and lo een now the gales
call thee aboard and stretch the swelling sails

to whom with sighs ulysses gave reply
ah why the illsuiting pastime must i try
to gloomy care my thoughts alone are free
ill the gay sports with troubled hearts agree
sad from my natal hour my days have ran
a muchafflicted muchenduring man
who suppliant to the king and peers implores
a speedy voyage to his native shore

wide wanders laodam thy erring tongue
the sports of glory to the brave belong
 he bears no claim
among the great unlike the sons of fame
a wandering merchant he frequents the main
some mean seafarer in pursuit of gain
studious of freight in naval trade well skilld
but dreads the athletic labours of the field

incensed ulysses with a frown replies
o forward to proclaim thy soul unwise
with partial hands the gods their gifts dispense
some greatly think some speak with manly sense
here heaven an elegance of form denies
but wisdom the defect of form supplies
this man with energy of thought controls
and steals with modest violence our souls
he speaks reservedly but he speaks with force
nor can one word be changed but for a worse
in public more than mortal he appears
and as he moves the praising crowd reveres
while others beauteous as the etherial kind
the nobler portion went a knowing mind
in outward show heaven gives thee to excel
but heaven denies the praise of thinking well
ill bear the brave a rude ungovernd tongue
and youth my generous soul resents the wrong
skilld in heroic exercise i claim
a post of honour with the sons of fame
such was my boast while vigour crownd my days
now care surrounds me and my force decays
inured a melancholy part to bear
in scenes of death by tempest and by war
yet thus by woes impaird no more i waive
to prove the heroslander stings the brave

then gliding forward with a furious bound
he wrenchd a rocky fragment from the ground
by far more ponderous and more huge by far
than what phæacias sons discharged in air
fierce from his arm the enormous load he flings
sonorous through the shaded air it sings
couchd to the earth tempestuous as it flies
the crowd gaze upward while it cleaves the skies
beyond all marks with many a giddy round
downrushing it upturns a hill of ground

that instant pallas bursting from a cloud
fixd a distinguishd mark and cried aloud

een he who sightless wants his visual ray
may by his touch alone award the day
thy signal throw transcends the utmost bound
of every champion by a length of ground
securely bid the strongest of the train
arise to throw the strongest throws in vain

she spoke and momentary mounts the sky
the friendly voice ulysses hears with joy
then thus aloud 
rise ye phæacians try your force 
if with this throw the strongest caster vie
still further still i bid the discus fly
stand forth ye champions who the gauntlet wield
or ye the swiftest racers of the field
stand forth ye wrestlers who these pastimes grace
i wield the gauntlet and i run the race
in such heroic games i yield to none
or yield to brave laodamas alone
shall i with brave laodamas contend
a friend is sacred and i style him friend
ungenerous were the man and base of heart
who takes the kind and pays the ungrateful part
chiefly the man in foreign realms confined
base to his friend to his own interest blind
all all your heroes i this day defy
give me a man that we our might may try
expert in every art i boast the skill
to give the featherd arrow wings to kill
should a whole host at once discharge the bow
my wellaimd shaft with death prevents the foe
alone superior in the field of troy
great philoctetes taught the shaft to fly
from all the sons of earth unrivalld praise
i justly claim but yield to better days
to those famed days when great alcides rose
and eurytus who bade the gods be foes

in fighting fields as far the spear i throw
as flies an arrow from the welldrawn bow
sole in the race the contest i decline
stiff are my weary joints and i resign
by storms and hunger worn age well may fail
when storms and hunger doth at once assail

abashd the numbers hear the godlike man
till great alcinous mildly thus began

well hast thou spoke and well thy generous tongue
with decent pride refutes a public wrong
warm are thy words but warm without offence
fear only fools secure in men of sense
thy worth is known then hear our countrys claim
and bear to heroes our heroic fame
in distant realms our glorious deeds display
repeat them frequent in the genial day
when blest with ease thy woes and wanderings end
teach them thy consort bid thy sons attend
how loved of jove he crownd our sires with praise
how we their offspring dignify our race

let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield
or boast the glories of the athletic field
we in the course unrivalld speed display
or through cerulean billows plough the way
to dress to dance to sing our sole delight
the feast or bath by day and love by night
rise then ye skilld in measures let him bear
your fame to men that breathe a distant air
and faithful say to you the powers belong
to race to sail to dance to chant the song

but herald to the palace swift repair
and the soft lyre to grace our pastimes bear

swift at the word obedient to the king
the herald flies the tuneful lyre to bring
up rose nine seniors chosen to survey
the future games the judges of the day
with instant care they mark a spacious round
and level for the dance the allotted ground
the herald bears the lyre intent to play
the bard advancing meditates the lay
skilld in the dance tall youths a blooming band
graceful before the heavenly minstrel stand
light bounding from the earth at once they rise
their feet halfviewless quiver in the skies
ulysses gazed astonishd to survey
the glancing splendours as their sandals play
meantime the bard alternate to the strings
the loves of mars and cytherea sings
how the stern god enamourd with her charms
claspd the gay panting goddess in his arms
by bribes seduced and how the sun whose eye
views the broad heavens disclosed the lawless joy
stung to the soul indignant through the skies
to his black forge vindictive vulcan flies
arrived his sinewy arms incessant place
the eternal anvil on the massy base
a wondrous net he labours to betray
the wanton lovers as entwined they lay
indissolubly strong then instant bears
to his immortal dome the finishd snares
above below around with art dispread
the sure inclosure folds the genial bed
whose texture even the search of gods deceives
thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves
then as withdrawing from the starry bowers
he feigns a journey to the lemnian shores
his favourite isle observant mars descries
his wishd recess and to the goddess flies
he glows he burns the fairhaird queen of love
descends smooth gliding from the courts of jove
gay blooming in full charms her hand he pressd
with eager joy and with a sigh addressd

come my beloved and taste the soft delights
come to repose the genial bed invites
thy absent spouse neglectful of thy charms
prefers his barbarous sintians to thy arms

then nothing loth the enamourd fair he led
and sunk transported on the conscious bed
down rushd the toils inwrapping as they lay
the careless lovers in their wanton play
in vain they strive the entangling snares deny
 the power to fly
warnd by the god who sheds the golden day
stern vulcan homeward treads the starry way
arrived he sees he grieves with rage he burns
full horribly he roars his voice all heaven returns

o jove  o all ye powers above
see the lewd dalliance of the queen of love
me awkward me she scorns and yields her charms
to that fair lecher the strong god of arms
if i am lame that stain my natal hour
by fate imposed such me my parent bore
why was i born see how the wanton lies
oh sight tormenting to a husbands eyes
but yet i trust this once een mars would fly
his fairones armshe thinks her once too nigh
but there remain ye guilty in my power
till jove refunds his shameless daughters dower
too dear i prized a fair enchanting face
beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace

meanwhile the gods the dome of vulcan throng
apollo comes and neptune comes along
with these gay hermes trod the starry plain
but modesty withheld the goddess train
all heaven beholds imprisond as they lie
and unextinguishd laughter shakes the sky
then mutual thus they spoke behold on wrong
swift vengeance waits and art subdues the strong
dwells there a god on all the olympian brow
more swift than mars and more than vulcan slow
yet vulcan conquers and the god of arms
must pay the penalty for lawless charms

thus serious they but he who gilds the skies
the gay apollo thus to hermes cries
wouldst thou enchaind like mars o hermes lie
and bear the shame like mars to share the joy

o envied shame 
and thrice the chains and thrice more firmly bind
gaze all ye gods and every goddess gaze
yet eager would i bless the sweet disgrace

loud laugh the rest een neptune laughs aloud
yet sues importunate to loose the god
and free  o vulcan free from shame
thy captives i ensure the penal claim

will neptune  the faithless trust
he suffers who gives surety for the unjust
but say if that lewd scandal of the sky
to liberty restored perfidious fly
say wilt thou bear the mulct he instant cries
the mulct i bear if mars perfidious flies

to whom appeased no more i urge delay
when neptune sues my part is to obey
then to the snares his force the god applies
they burst and mars to thrace indignant flies
to the soft cyprian shores the goddess moves
to visit paphos and her blooming groves
where to the power an hundred altars rise
and breathing odours scent the balmy skies
concealed she bathes in consecrated bowers
the graces unguents shed ambrosial showers
unguents that charm the gods she last assumes
her wondrous robes and full the goddess blooms

thus sung the bard ulysses hears with joy
and loud applauses read the vaulted sky

then to the sports his sons the king commands
each blooming youth before the monarch stands
in dance unmatchd a wondrous ball is brought

this youth with strength enormous bids it fly
and bending backward whirls it to the sky
his brother springing with an active bound
at distance intercepts it from the ground
the ball dismissed in dance they skim the strand
turn and return and scarce imprint the sand
the assembly gazes with astonished eyes
and sends in shouts applauses to the skies

then thus ulysses happy king whose name
the brightest shines in all the rolls of fame
in subjects happy with surprise i gaze
thy praise was just their skill transcends thy praise

pleasd with his peoples fame the monarch hears
and thus benevolent accosts the peers
since wisdoms sacred guidance he pursues
give to the strangerguest a strangers dues
twelve princes in our realm dominion share
oer whom supreme imperial power i bear
bring gold a pledge of love a talent bring
a vest a robe and imitate your king
be swift to give that he this night may share
the social feast of joy with joy sincere
and thou euryalus redeem thy wrong
a generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue

the assenting peers obedient to the king
in haste their heralds send the gifts to bring
then thus euryalus o prince whose sway
rules this blessd realm repentant i obey
be his this sword whose blade of brass displays
a ruddy gleam whose hilt a silver blaze
whose ivory sheath inwrought with curious pride
adds graceful terror to the wearers side

he said and to his hand the sword consignd
and if  my words affect thy mind
far from thy mind those words ye whirlwinds bear
and scatter them ye storms in empty air
crown o ye heavens with joy his peaceful hours
and grant him to his spouse and native shores

and blest be thou my friend 
crown him with every joy ye favouring skies
to thy calm hours continued peace afford
and never never mayst thou want this sword

he said and oer his shoulder flung the blade
now oer the earth ascends the evening shade
the precious gifts the illustrious heralds bear
and to the court the embodied peers repair
before the queen alcinous sons unfold
the vests the robes and heaps of shining gold
then to the radiant thrones they move in state
aloft the king in pomp imperial sate

thence to the queen o partner of our reign
o sole beloved command thy menial train
a polishd chest and stately robes to bear
and healing waters for the bath prepare
that bathed our guest may bid his sorrows cease
hear the sweet song and taste the feast in peace
a bowl that flames with gold of wondrous frame
ourself we give memorial of our name
to raise in offerings to almighty jove
and every god that treads the courts above

instant the queen observant of the king
commands her train a spacious vase to bring
the spacious vase with ample streams suffice
heap the high wood and bid the flames arise
the flames climb round it with a fierce embrace
the fuming waters bubble oer the blaze
herself the chest prepares in order rolld
the robes the vests are ranged and heaps of gold
and adding a rich dress inwrought with art
a gift expressive of her bounteous heart
thus spoke to ithacus to guard with bands
insolvable these gifts thy care demands
lest in thy slumbers on the watery main
the hand of rapine make our bounty vain

then bending with full force around he rolld
a labyrinth of bands in fold on fold
closed with circaean art a train attends
around the bath the bath the king ascends

where happy as the gods that range the sky
he feasted every sense with every joy
he bathes the damsels with officious toil
shed sweets shed unguents in a shower of oil
then oer his limbs a gorgeous robe he spreads
and to the feast magnificently treads
full where the dome its shining valves expands
nausicaa blooming as a goddess stands
with wondering eyes the hero she surveyd
and graceful thus began the royal maid

hail godlike stranger and when heaven restores
to thy fond wish thy longexpected shores
this ever grateful in remembrance bear
to me thou owest to me the vital air

o royal maid 
whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns
so may dread jove 
restore me safe through weary wanderings tossd
to my dear countrys everpleasing coast
as while the spirit in this bosom glows
to thee my goddess i address my vows
my life thy gift i boast he said and sate
fast by alcinous on a throne of state

now each partakes the feast the wine prepares
portions the food and each his portion shares
the bard a herald guides the gazing throng
pay low obeisance as he moves along
beneath a sculpturd arch he sits enthroned
the peers encircling form an awful round
then from the chine ulysses carves with art
delicious food an honorary part
this let the master of the lyre receive
a pledge of love tis all a wretch can give
lives there a man beneath the spacious skies
who sacred honours to the bard denies
the muse the bard inspires exalts his mind
the muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind

the herald to his hand the charge conveys
not fond of flattery nor unpleased with praise

when now the rage of hunger was allayd
thus to the lyrist wise ulysses said
o more than man thy soul the muse inspires
or phœbus animates with all his fires
for who by phœbus uninformd could know
the woe of greece and sing so well the woe
just to the tale as present at the fray
or taught the labours of the dreadful day
the song recalls past horrors to my eyes
and bids proud ilion from her ashes rise
once more harmonious strike the sounding string
the epaean fabric framed by pallas sing
how stern ulysses furious to destroy
with latent heroes sackd imperial troy
if faithful thou record the tale of fame
the god himself inspires thy breast with flame
and mine shall be the task henceforth to raise
in every land thy monument of praise

full of the god he raised his lofty strain
how the greeks rushd tumultuous to the main
how blazing tents illumined half the skies
while from the shores the winged navy flies
how een in ilions walls in deathful bands
came the stern greeks by troys assisting hands
all troy upheaved the steed of differing mind
various the trojans counselld part consignd
the monster to the sword part sentence gave
to plunge it headlong in the whelming wave
the unwise award to lodge it in the towers
an offering sacred to the immortal powers
the unwise prevail they lodge it in the walls
and by the gods decree proud ilion falls
destruction enters in the treacherous wood
and vengeful slaughter fierce for human blood

he sung the greeks sternissuing from the steed
how ilion burns how all her fathers bleed
how to thy dome deiphobus ascends
the spartan king how ithacus attends
 and how with dire alarms
he fightssubdues for pallas strings his arms

thus while he sung ulysses griefs renew
tears bathe his cheeks and tears the ground bedew
as some fond matron views in mortal fight
her husband falling in his countrys right
frantic through clashing swords she runs she flies
as ghastly pale he groans and faints and dies
close to his breast she grovels on the ground
and bathes with floods of tears the gaping wound
she cries she shrieks the fierce insulting foe
relentless mocks her violence of woe
to chains condemnd as wildly she deplores
a widow and a slave on foreign shores

so from the sluices of ulysses eyes
fast fell the tears and sighs succeeded sighs
conceald he grieved the king observed alone
the silent tear and heard the secret groan
then to the bard aloud o cease to sing
dumb be thy voice and mute the tuneful string
to every note his tears responsive flow
and his great heart heaves with tumultuous woe
thy lay too deeply moves then cease the lay
and oer the banquet every heart be gay
this social right demands for him the sails
floating in air invite the impelling gales
his are the gifts of love the wise and good
receive the stranger as a brothers blood

but friend discover faithful what i crave
artful concealment ill becomes the brave
say what thy birth and what the name you bore
imposed by parents in the natal hour

say from what city from what regions tossd
and what inhabitants those regions boast
so shalt thou instant reach the realm assignd
in wondrous ships selfmoved instinct with mind
no helm secures their course no pilot guides
like man intelligent they plough the tides
conscious of every coast and every bay
that lies beneath the suns allseeing ray
though clouds and darkness veil the encumberd sky
fearless through darkness and through clouds they fly
though tempests rage though rolls the swelling main
the seas may roll the tempests rage in vain
een the stern god that oer the waves presides
safe as they pass and safe repass the tides
with fury burns while careless they convey
promiscuous every guest to every bay
these ears have heard my royal sire disclose
a dreadful story big with future woes
how neptune raged and how by his command
firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand
a monument of wrath how mound on mound
should bury these proud towers beneath the ground
but this the gods may frustrate or fulfil
as suits the purpose of the eternal will
but say through what waste regions hast thou strayd
what customs noted and what coasts surveyd
possessd by wild barbarians fierce in arms
or men whose bosom tender pity warms
say why the fate of troy awaked thy cares
why heaved thy bosom and why flowed thy tears
just are the ways of heaven from heaven proceed
the woes of man heaven doomd the greeks to bleed
a theme of future song say then if slain
some dearloved brother pressd the phrygian plain
or bled some friend who bore a brothers part
and claimd by merit not by blood the heart





then thus ulysses thou whom first in sway
as first in virtue these thy realms obey
how sweet the products of a peaceful reign
the heaventaught poet and enchanting strain
the wellfilled palace the perpetual feast
a land rejoicing and a people blessd
how goodly seems it ever to employ
mans social days in union and in joy
the plenteous hoard highheapd with cates divine
and oer the foaming bowl the laughing wine

amid these joys why seeks thy mind to know
the unhappy series of a wanderers woe
rememberance sad whose image to review
alas i must open all my wounds anew
and oh what first what last shall i relate
of woes unnumbered sent by heaven and fate

know first the man 
who hopes thee monarch for his future guest
behold ulysses no ignoble name
earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame

my native soil is ithaca the fair
where high neritus waves his woods in air
dulichium same and zaccynthus crownd
with shady mountains spread their isles around

low lies our isle yet blessd in fruitful stores
strong are her sons though rocky are her shores
and none ah none no lovely to my sight
of all the lands that heaven oerspreads with light
in vain calypso long constrained my stay
with sweet reluctant amorous delay
with all her charms as vainly circe strove
and added magic to secure my love
in pomps or joys the palace or the grot
my countrys image never was forgot
my absent parents rose before my sight
and distant lay contentment and delight

hear then the woes which mighty jove ordaind
to wait my passage from the trojan land
the winds from ilion to the cicons shore
beneath cold ismarus our vessels bore
we boldly landed on the hostile place
and sackd the city and destroyd the race
their wives made captive their possessions shared
and every soldier found a like reward
i then advised to fly not so the rest
who stayd to revel and prolong the feast
the fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay
and bowls flow round and riot wastes the day
meantime the cicons to their holds retired
call on the cicons with new fury fired
with early morn the gatherd country swarms
and all the continent is bright with arms
thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers
oerspread the land when spring descends in showers
all expert soldiers skilld on foot to dare
or from the bounding courser urge the war
now fortune changes 
our hour was come to taste our share of pain
close at the ships the bloody fight began
wounded they wound and man expires on man
long as the morning sun increasing bright
oer heavens pure azure spreads the glowing light
promiscuous death the form of war confounds
each adverse battle gored with equal wounds
but when his evening wheels oerhung the main
then conquest crownd the fierce ciconian train
six brave companions from each ship we lost
the rest escape in haste and quit the coast
with sails outspread we fly the unequal strife
sad for their loss but joyful of our life
yet as we fled our fellows rites we paid
and thrice we calld on each unhappy shade

meanwhile the god whose hand the thunder forms
drives clouds on clouds and blackens heaven with storms
wide oer the waste the rage of boreas sweeps
and night rushd headlong on the shaded deeps
now here now there the giddy ships are borne
and all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn
we furld the sail we plied the labouring oar
took down our masts and rowd our ships to shore
two tedious days and two long nights we lay
oerwatchd and batterd in the naked bay
but the third morning when aurora brings
we rear the masts we spread the canvas wings
refreshd and careless on the deck reclined
we sit and trust the pilot and the wind
then to my native country had i saild
but the cape doubled adverse winds prevaild
strong was the tide which by the northern blast
impelld our vessels on cythera cast
nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore
far in wide ocean and from sight of shore
the tenth we touchd by various errors tossd
the land of lotus and the flowery coast
we climbd the beach and springs of water found
then spread our hasty banquet on the ground
three men were sent deputed from the crew
 the dubious coast to view
and learn what habitants possessd the place
they went and found a hospitable race
not prone to ill nor strange to foreign guest
they eat they drink and nature gives the feast
the trees around them all their food produce
lotus the name divine nectareous juice
 which whose tastes
insatiate riots in the sweet repasts
nor other home nor other care intends
but quits his house his country and his friends
the three we sent from off the enchanting ground
we draggd reluctant and by force we bound
the rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore
or the charm tasted had returnd no more
now placed in order on their banks they sweep
the seas smooth face and cleave the hoary deep
with heavy hearts we labour through the tide
to coasts unknown and oceans yet untried

the land of cyclops first a savage kind
nor tamed by manners nor by laws confined
untaught to plant to turn the glebe and sow
they all their products to free nature owe
the soil untilld a ready harvest yields
with wheat and barley wave the golden fields
spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour
and jove descends in each prolific shower
by these no statues and no rights are known
no council held no monarch fills the throne
but high on hills or airy cliffs they dwell
or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell
each rules his race his neighbour not his care
heedless of others to his own severe

opposed to the cyclopean coast there lay
an isle whose hill their subject fields survey
its name lachaea crownd with many a grove
where savage goats through pathless thickets rove
no needy mortals here with hunger bold
or wretched hunters through the wintry cold
pursue their flight but leave them safe to bound
from hill to hill oer all the desert ground
nor knows the soil to feed the fleecy care
or feels the labours of the crooked share
but uninhabited untilld unsown
it lies and breeds the bleating goat alone
for there no vessel with vermilion prore
or bark of traffic glides from shore to shore
the rugged race of savages unskilld
the seas to traverse or the ships to build
gaze on the coast nor cultivate the soil
unlearnd in all the industrious art of toil
yet here all products and all plants abound
sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground
fields waving high with heavy crops are seen
and vines that flourish in eternal green
refreshing meads along the murmuring main
and fountains streaming down the fruitful plain

a port there is inclosed on either side
where ships may rest unanchord and untied
till the glad mariners incline to sail
and the sea whitens with the rising gale
high at the head from out the cavernd rock
in living rills a gushing fountain broke
around it and above for ever green
the busy alders formd a shady scene
hither some favouring god beyond our thought
through all surrounding shade our navy brought
for gloomy night descended on the main
nor glimmerd phoebe in the ethereal plain
but all unseen the clouded island lay
and all unseen the surge and rolling sea
till safe we anchord in the shelterd bay
our sails we gatherd cast our cables oer
and slept secure along the sandy shore
soon as again the rosy morning shone
reveald the landscape and the scene unknown
with wonder seized we view the pleasing ground
and walk delighted and expatiate round
roused by the woodland nymphs at early dawn
the mountain goats came bounding oer the lawn
in haste our fellows to the ships repair
for arms and weapons of the sylvan war
straight in three squadrons all our crew we part
and bend the bow or wing the missile dart
the bounteous gods afford a copious prey
and nine fat goats each vessel bears away
the royal bark had ten our ships complete
we thus supplied 

here till the setting sun rolld down the light
we sat indulging in the genial rite
nor wines were wanting those from ample jars
we draind the prize of our ciconian wars
the land of cyclops lay in prospect near
the voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear
and from their mountains rising smokes appear
now sunk the sun and darkness coverd oer
the face of things along the seabeat shore
satiate we slept but when the sacred dawn
arising glitterd oer the dewy lawn
i calld my fellows and these words addressd
my dear associates here indulge your rest
while with my single ship adventurous i
go forth the manners of yon men to try
whether a race unjust of barbarous might
rude and unconscious of a strangers right
or such who harbour pity in their breast
revere the gods and succour the distressd

this said i climbd my vessels lofty side
my train obeyd me and the ship untied
in order seated on their banks they sweep
neptunes smooth face and cleave the yielding deep
when to the nearest verge of land we drew
fast by the sea a lonely cave we view
high and with darkening laurels covered oer
where sheep and goats lay slumbering round the shore
near this a fence of marble from the rock
brown with oerarching pine and spreading oak
a giant shepherd here his flock maintains
far from the rest and solitary reigns
in shelter thick of horrid shade reclined
and gloomy mischiefs labour in his mind
a form enormous far unlike the race
of human birth in stature or in face
as some lone mountains monstrous growth he stood
crownd with rough thickets and a nodding wood
i left my vessel at the point of land
and close to guard it gave our crew command
with only twelve the boldest and the best
i seek the adventure and forsake the rest
then took a goatskin filld with precious wine
the gift of maron of evantheus line

in sacred shade his honourd mansion stood
amidst apollos consecrated wood
him and his house heaven moved my mind to save
and costly presents in return he gave
seven golden talents to perfection wrought
a silver bowl that held a copious draught
and twelve large vessels of unmingled wine
mellifluous undecaying and divine
which now some ages from his race conceald
the hoary sire in gratitude reveald
such was the wine to quench whose fervent steam
scarce twenty measures from the living stream
to cool one cup sufficed the goblet crownd
breathed aromatic fragrances around
of this an ample vase we heaved aboard
and brought another with provisions stored
my soul foreboded i should find the bower
of some fell monster fierce with barbarous power
some rustic wretch who lived in heavens despite
contemning laws and trampling on the right
the cave we found but vacant all within

but round the grot we gaze and all we view
in order ranged our admiration drew
the bending shelves with loads of cheeses pressd
the folded flocks each separate from the rest

the cavern echoes with responsive cries
capacious chargers all around were laid
full pails and vessels of the milking trade
with fresh provisions hence our fleet to store
my friends advise me and to quit the shore
or drive a flock of sheep and goats away
consult our safety and put off to sea
their wholesome counsel rashly i declined
curious to view the man of monstrous kind
and try what social rites a savage lends
dire rites alas and fatal to my friends

then first a fire we kindle and prepare
for his return with sacrifice and prayer
the loaden shelves afford us full repast
we sit expecting lo he comes at last
near half a forest on his back he bore
and cast the ponderous burden at the door
it thunderd as it fell we trembled then
and sought the deep recesses of the den
new driven before him through the arching rock
came tumbling heaps on heaps the unnumberd flock
bigudderd ewes and goats of female kind

then heaved on high a rocks enormous weight
to the caves mouth he rolld and closed the gate

he next betakes him to his evening cares
and sitting down to milk his flocks prepares
of half their udders eases first the dams
then to the mothers teat submits the lambs
half the white stream to hardening cheese be pressd
and high in wickerbaskets heapd the rest
reserved in bowls supplied his nightly feast
his labour done he fired the pile that gave
a sudden blaze and lighted all the cave
we stand discoverd by the rising fires
askance the giant glares and thus inquires

what are ye guests on what adventure say
thus far ye wander through the watery way
pirates perhaps who seek through seas unknown
the lives of others and expose your own

his voice like thunder through the cavern sounds
my bold companions thrilling fear confounds
appalld at sight of more than mortal man
at length with heart recoverd i began

from troys famed fields sad wanderers oer the main
behold the relics of the grecian train
through various seas by various perils tossd
and forced by storms unwilling on your coast
far from our destined course and native land
such was our fate and such high joves command
nor what we are befits us to disclaim
atrides friends 
who taught proud troy and all her sons to bow
victors of late but humble suppliants now
low at thy knee thy succour we implore
respect us human and relieve us poor
at least some hospitable gift bestow
tis what the happy to the unhappy owe
tis what the gods require those gods revere
the poor and stranger are their constant care
to jove their cause and their revenge belongs
he wanders with them and he feels their wrongs

fools that ye are 
or strangers distant far from our abodes
to bid me reverence or regard the gods
know then we cyclops are a race above
those airbred people and their goatnursed jove
and learn our power proceeds with thee and thine
not as he wills but as ourselves incline
but answer the good ship that brought ye oer
where lies she anchord near or off the shore

thus he his meditated fraud i find

and cautious thus against a dreadful rock
fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke
scarce with these few i scaped of all my train
whom angry neptune whelmd beneath the main
the scattered wreck the winds blew back again

he answerd with his deed his bloody hand
snatchd two unhappy of my martial band
and dashd like dogs against the stony floor
the pavement swims with brains and mingled gore
torn limb from limb he spreads his horrid feast
and fierce devours it like a mountain beast
he sucks the marrow and the blood he drains
nor entrails flesh nor solid bone remains
we see the death from which we cannot move
and humbled groan beneath the hand of jove
his ample maw with human carnage filld
a milky deluge next the giant swilld
then stretchd in length oer half the cavernd rock
lay senseless and supine amidst the flock
to seize the time and with a sudden wound
to fix the slumbering monster to the ground
my soul impels me and in act i stand
to draw the sword but wisdom held my hand
a deed so rash had finished all our fate
no mortal forces from the lofty gate
could roll the rock in hopeless grief we lay
and sigh expecting the return of day
now did the rosyfingered morn arise
and shed her sacred light along the skies
he wakes he lights the fire he milks the dams
and to the mothers teats submits the lambs
the task thus finishd of his morning hours
two more he snatches murders and devours
then pleased and whistling drives his flock before
removes the rocky mountain from the door
and shuts again with equal ease disposed
as a light quivers lid is oped and closed
his giant voice the echoing region fills
his flocks obedient spread oer all the hills

thus left behind even in the last despair
i thought devised and pallas heard my prayer
revenge and doubt and caution workd my breast
but this of many counsels seemd the best
the monsters club within the cave i spied
a tree of stateliest growth and yet undried
green from the wood of height and bulk so vast
the largest ship might claim it for a mast
this shortend of its top i gave my train
a fathoms length to shape it and to plane
the narrower end i sharpend to a spire
whose point we hardend with the force of fire
and hid it in the dust that strewd the cave
then to my few companions bold and brave
proposed who first the venturous deed should try
in the broad orbit of his monstrous eye
to plunge the brand and twirl the pointed wood
when slumber next should tame the man of blood
just as i wished the lots were cast on four
myself the fifth we stand and wait the hour
he comes with evening all his fleecy flock
before him march and pour into the rock
not one or male or female stayed behind

then heaving high the stones unwieldy weight
he rolld it on the cave and closed the gate
first down he sits to milk the woolly dams
and then permits their udder to the lambs
next seized two wretches more and headlong cast
braind on the rock his second dire repast
i then approachd him reeking with their gore
and held the brimming goblet foaming oer
cyclop since human flesh has been thy feast
now drain this goblet potent to digest
know hence what treasures in our ship we lost
and what rich liquors other climates boast
we to thy shore the precious freight shall bear
if home thou send us and vouchsafe to spare
but oh thus furious thirsting thus for gore
the sons of men shall neer approach thy shore
and never shalt thou taste this nectar more

he heard he took and pouring down his throat
delighted swilld the large luxurious draught
more give me more  the boon be thine
whoeer thou art that bearst celestial wine
declare thy name not mortal is this juice
such as the unblessd cyclopaean climes produce

but this descended from the blessd abodes
a rill of nectar streaming from the gods

he said and greedy grasped the heady bowl
thrice drained and poured the deluge on his soul
his sense lay covered with the dozy fume
while thus my fraudful speech i reassume
thy promised boon o cyclop now i claim
and plead my title noman is my name
by that distinguishd from my tender years
tis what my parents call me and my peers

the giant then our promisd grace receive
the hospitable boon we mean to give
when all thy wretched crew have felt my power
noman shall be the last i will devour

he said then nodding with the fumes of wine
droopd his huge head and snoring lay supine
his neck obliquely oer his shoulders hung
pressd with the weight of sleep that tames the strong
there belchd the mingled streams of wine and blood
and human flesh his indigested food
sudden i stir the embers and inspire
with animating breath the seeds of fire
each drooping spirit with bold words repair
and urged my train the dreadful deed to dare
the stake now glowd beneath the burning bed
 and sparkled fiery red
then forth the vengeful instrument i bring
with beating hearts my fellows form a ring
urged my some present god they swift let fall
the pointed torment on his visual ball
myself above them from a rising ground
guide the sharp stake and twirl it round and round
as when a shipwright stands his workmen oer
who ply the wimble some huge beam to bore
urged on all hands it nimbly spins about
the grain deeppiercing till it scoops it out
in his broad eye he whirls the fiery wood
from the pierced pupil spouts the boiling blood
singed are his brows the scorching lids grow black
the jelly bubbles and the fibres crack
and as when armourers temper in the ford
the keenedged poleaxe or the shining sword
the redhot metal hisses in the lake
thus in his eyeball hissd the plunging stake
he sends a dreadful groan the rocks around
through all their inmost winding caves resound
scared we recoiled forth with frantic hand
he tore and dashd on earth and gory brand
then calls the cyclops all that round him dwell
with voice like thunder and a direful yell
from all their dens the oneeyed race repair
from rifted rocks and mountains bleak in air
all haste assembled at his wellknown roar
inquire the cause and crowd the cavern door

what hurts thee polypheme what strange affright
thus breaks our slumbers and disturbs the night
does any mortal in the unguarded hour
of sleep oppress thee or by fraud or power
or thieves insidious thy fair flock surprise
thus they the cyclop from his den replies

friends noman kills me noman in the hour
of sleep oppresses me with fraudful power
if no man hurt thee but the hand divine
inflict disease it fits thee to resign
to jove or to thy father neptune pray
the brethren cried and instant strode away
joy touchd my secret soul and conscious heart
pleased with the effect of conduct and of art
meantime the cyclop raging with his wound
spreads his wide arms and searches round and round
at last the stone removing from the gate
with hands extended in the midst he sate
and searchd each passing sheep and felt it oer
secure to seize us ere we reachd the door

but secret i revolved the deep design
twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought
each scheme i turnd and sharpend every thought
this way and that i cast to save my friends
till one resolve my varying counsel ends

strong were the rams with native purple fair
well fed and largest of the fleecy care
these three and three with osier bands we tied

the midmost bore a man the outward two
secured each side so bound we all the crew
one ram remaind the leader of the flock
in his deep fleece my grasping hands i lock
and fast beneath in wooly curls inwove
there cling implicit and confide in jove
when rosy morning glimmerd oer the dales
he drove to pasture all the lusty males
the ewes still folded with distended thighs
unmilkd lay bleating in distressful cries
but heedless of those cares with anguish stung
he felt their fleeces as they passd along
 and let them safely go
all unsuspecting of their freight below

the master ram at last approachd the gate
charged with his wool and with ulysses fate
him while he passd the monster blind bespoke
what makes my ram the lag of all the flock
first thou wert wont to crop the flowery mead
first to the field and rivers bank to lead
and first with stately step at evening hour
thy fleecy fellows usher to their bower
now far the last with pensive pace and slow
thou movest as conscious of thy masters woe
seest thou these lids that now unfold in vain

oh didst thou feel for thy afflicted lord
and would but fate the power of speech afford
soon mightst thou tell me where in secret here
the dastard lurks all trembling with his fear
swung round and round and dashd from rock to rock
his battered brains should on the pavement smoke
no ease no pleasure my sad heart receives
while such a monster as vile noman lives

the giant spoke and through the hollow rock
dismissd the ram the father of the flock
no sooner freed and through the inclosure passd
first i release myself my fellows last
fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before
and reach our vessel on the winding shore
with joy the sailors view their friends returnd
and hail us living whom as dead they mournd
big tears of transport stand in every eye
i check their fondness and command to fly
aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep
and snatch their oars and rush into the deep

now off at sea and from the shallows clear
as far as human voice could reach the ear
with taunts the distant giant i accost
hear me o cyclop hear ungracious host
twas on no coward no ignoble slave
thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave
but one the vengeance fated from above
doomd to inflict the instrument of jove
thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands
the god the god revenges by my hands

these words the cyclops burning rage provoke
from the tall hill he rends a pointed rock
high oer the billows flew the massy load
and near the ship came thundering on the flood
it almost brushd the helm and fell before
the whole sea shook and refluent beat the shore
the strong concussion on the heaving tide
rolld back the vessel to the islands side
again i shoved her off our fate to fly
each nerve we stretch and every oar we ply
just scaped impending death when now again
we twice as far had furrowd back the main
once more i raise my voice my friends afraid
with mild entreaties my design dissuade
what boots the godless giant to provoke
whose arm may sink us at a single stroke
already when the dreadful rock he threw
old ocean shook and back his surges flew
the sounding voice directs his aim again
the rock oerwhelms us and we scaped in vain

but i of mind elate and scorning fear
thus with new taunts insult the monsters ear
cyclop if any pitying thy disgrace
ask who disfigured thus that eyeless face
say twas ulysses twas his deed declare
laertes son of ithaca the fair
ulysses far in fighting fields renownd
before whose arm troy tumbled to the ground

the astonished savage with a roar replies
oh heavens oh faith of ancient prophecies
this telemus eurymedes foretold

long since he menaced such was fates command
and named ulysses as the destined hand
i deemd some godlike giant to behold
or lofty hero haughty brave and bold
not this weak pigmy wretch of mean design
who not by strength subdued me but by wine
but come accept our gifts and join to pray
great neptunes blessing on the watery way
for his i am and i the lineage own
the immortal father no less boasts the son
his power can heal me and relight my eye
and only his of all the gods on high
oh could this arm 
from that vast bulk dislodge thy bloody mind
and send thee howling to the realms of night
as sure as neptune cannot give thee sight
thus i while raging he repeats his cries
with hands uplifted to the starry skies
hear me o neptune thou whose arms are hurld
from shore to shore and gird the solid world
if thine i am nor thou my birth disown
and if the unhappy cyclop be thy son
let not ulysses breathe his native air
laertes son of ithaca the fair
if to review his country be his fate
be it through toils and sufferings long and late
his lost companions let him first deplore
some vessel not his own transport him oer
and when at home from foreign sufferings freed
more near and deep domestic woes succeed
with imprecations thus he filld the air
and angry neptune heard the unrighteous prayer
a larger rock then heaving from the plain
he whirld it round it sung across the main
it fell and brushd the stern the billows roar
shake at the weight and refluent beat the shore
with all our force we kept aloof to sea
and gaind the island where our vessels lay
our sight the whole collected navy cheerd
who waiting long by turns had hoped and feard
there disembarking on the green sea side
we land our cattle and the spoil divide
of these due shares to every sailor fall
the master ram was voted mine by all
and him 
with pious mind to heaven i consecrate
but the great god whose thunder rends the skies
averse beholds the smoking sacrifice
and sees me wandering still from coast to coast
and all my vessels all my people lost
while thoughtless we indulge the genial rite
as plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite
till evening phœbus rolld away the light
stretchd on the shore in careless ease we rest
till ruddy morning purpled oer the east
then from their anchors all our ships unbind
and mount the decks and call the willing wind
now ranged in order on our banks we sweep
with hasty strokes the hoarseresounding deep
blind to the future pensive with our fears
glad for the living for the dead in tears






at length we reachd æoliass seagirt shore
where great hippotades the sceptre bore
a floating isle highraised by toil divine
strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine
six blooming youths in private grandeur bred
and six fair daughters graced the royal bed
these sons their sisters wed and all remain
their parents pride and pleasure of their reign
all day they feast all day the bowls flow round
and joy and music through the isle resound
at night each pair on splendid carpets lay
and crownd with love the pleasures of the day
this happy port affords our wandering fleet
a months reception and a safe retreat
full oft the monarch urged me to relate
the fall of ilion and the grecian fate
full oft i told at length for parting moved
the king with mighty gifts my suit approved
the adverse winds in leathern bags he braced
compressd their force and lockd each struggling blast
for him the mighty sire of gods assignd
the tempests lord the tyrant of the wind
his word alone the listening storms obey
to smooth the deep or swell the foamy sea
these in my hollow ship the monarch hung
securely fetterd by a silver thong
but zephyrus exempt with friendly gales
he charged to fill and guide the swelling sails
rare gift but o what gift to fools avails

nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar
the tenth presents our welcome native shore
the hills display the beacons friendly light
and rising mountains gain upon our sight
then first my eyes by watchful toils oppressd
complied to take the balmy gifts of rest
then first my hands did from the rudder part

when lo on board a fond debate arose
what rare device those vessels might inclose
what sum what prize from æolus i brought
whilst to his neighbour each expressd his thought

say whence ye gods contending nations strive
who most shall please who most our hero give
long have his coffers groand with trojan spoils
whilst we the wretched partners of his toils
reproachd by want our fruitless labours mourn
and only rich in barren fame return
now æolus ye see augments his store
but come my friends these mystic gifts explore
they said and  the thongs unbound
the gushing tempest sweeps the ocean round
snatchd in the whirl the hurried navy flew
the ocean widend and the shores withdrew
roused from my fatal sleep i long debate
if still to live or desperate plunge to fate
thus doubting prostrate on the deck i lay
till all the coward thoughts of death gave way

meanwhile our vessels plough the liquid plain
and soon the known aeolian coast regain
our groan the rocks remurmurd to the main
we leapd on shore and with a scanty feast
our thirst and hunger hastily repressd
that done two chosen heralds straight attend
our second progress to my royal friend
and him amidst his jovial sons we found
the banquet steaming and the goblets crownd
there humbly stoopd with conscious shame and awe
nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw
but soon his sons their wellknown guest descried
and starting from their couches loudly cried
ulysses here what demon couldst thou meet
to thwart thy passage and repel thy fleet
wast thou not furnishd by our choicest care
for greece for home and all thy soul held dear
thus they in silence long my fate i mournd
at length these words with accents low returnd
me lockd in sleep my faithless crew bereft
of all the blessing of your godlike gift
but grant oh grant our loss we may retrieve
a favour you and you alone can give

thus i with art to move their pity tried
and touchd the youths but their stern sire replied
vile wretch begone this instant i command
thy fleet accursed to leave our hallowd land
his baneful suit pollutes these blessd abodes
whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods

thus fierce he said we sighing went our way
and with desponding hearts put off to sea
the sailors spent with toils their folly mourn
but mourn in vain no prospect of return
six days and nights a doubtful course we steer
the next proud lamos stately towers appear
and laestrygonias gates arise distinct in air
the shepherd quitting here at night the plain
calls to succeed his cares the watchful swain
but he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear
and adds the herdsmans to the shepherds care
so near the pastures and so short the way
his double toils may claim a double pay
and join the labours of the night and day

within a long recess a bay there lies
edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies
the jutting shores that swell on either side
contract its mouth and break the rushing tide
our eager sailors seize the fair retreat
and bound within the port their crowded fleet
for here retired the sinking billows sleep
and smiling calmness silverd oer the deep
i only in the bay refused to moor
and fixd without my halsers to the shore

from thence we climbd a point whose airy brow
commands the prospect of the plains below
no tracks of beasts or signs of men we found
but smoky volumes rolling from the ground
two with our herald thither we command
with speed to learn what men possessd the land
they went and kept the wheels smoothbeaten road
which to the city drew the mountain wood
when lo they met beside a crystal spring
the daughter of antiphates the king
she to artacias silver streams came down

the damsel they approach and askd what race
the people were who monarch of the place
with joy the maid the unwary strangers heard
and showd them where the royal dome appeard
they went but as they entering saw the queen
of size enormous and terrific mien

a sudden horror struck their aching sight
swift at her call her husband scourd away
to wreak his hunger on the destined prey
one for his food the raging glutton slew
but two rushd out and to the navy flew

balkd of his prey the yelling monster flies
and fills the city with his hideous cries
a ghastly band of giants hear the roar
and pouring down the mountains crowd the shore
fragments they rend from off the craggy brow
and dash the ruins on the ships below
the crackling vessels burst hoarse groans arise
and mingled horrors echo to the skies
the men like fish they struck upon the flood
and crammd their filthy throats with human food
whilst thus their fury rages at the bay
my sword our cables cut i calld to weigh
and charged my men as they from fate would fly
each nerve to strain each bending oar to ply
the sailors catch the word their oars they seize
and sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas
clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies
whilst in the port each wretch encumberd dies
with earnest haste my frighted sailors press
while kindling transports glowd at our success
but the sad fate that did our friends destroy
coold every breast and dampd the rising joy

now droppd our anchors in the ææan bay
where circe dwelt the daughter of the day
her mother perse of old oceans strain
thus from the sun descended and the main

goddess the queen to whom the powers belong
of dreadful magic and commanding song
some god directing to this peaceful bay
silent we came and melancholy lay
spent and oerwatchd two days and nights rolld on
and now the third succeeding morning shone
i climbd a cliff with spear and sword in hand
whose ridge oerlookd a shady length of land
to learn if aught of mortal works appear
or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear
from the high point i markd in distant view
a stream of curling smoke ascending blue
and spiry tops the tufted trees above
of circes palace bosomd in the grove

thither to haste the region to explore
was first my thought but speeding back to shore
i deemd it best to visit first my crew
and send our spies the dubious coast to view
as down the hill i solitary go
some power divine who pities human woe
sent a tall stag descending from the wood
to cool his fervour in the crystal flood
luxuriant on the waveworn bank he lay
stretchd forth and panting in the sunny ray
i launchd my spear and with a sudden wound
transpierced his back and fixd him to the ground
he falls and mourns his fate with human cries
through the wide wound the vital spirit flies
i drew and casting on the rivers side
the bloody spear his gatherd feet i tied
with twining osiers which the bank supplied
an ell in length the pliant wisp i weaved
and the huge body on my shoulders heaved
then leaning on my spear with both my hands
upbore my load and pressd the sinking sands
with weighty steps till at the ship i threw
the welcome burden and bespoke my crew

cheer up my friends it is not yet our fate
to glide with ghosts through plutos gloomy gate
food in the desert land behold is given
live and enjoy the providence of heaven

the joyful crew survey his mighty size
and on the future banquet feast their eyes
as huge in length extended lay the beast
then wash their hands and hasten to the feast
there till the setting sun rolld down the light
they sate indulging in the genial rite
when evening rose and darkness coverd oer
the face of things we slept along the shore
but when the rosy morning warmd the east
my men i summond and these words addressd
followers and friends attend what i propose
ye sad companions of ulysses woes
we know not here what land before us lies
or to what quarter now we turn our eyes
or where the sun shall set or where shall rise
here let us think 
if any counsel any hope remain
alas from yonder promontorys brow
i viewd the coast a region flat and low
an isle encircled with the boundless flood
a length of thickets and entangled wood
some smoke i saw amid the forest rise
and all around it only seas and skies

with broken hearts my sad companions stood
mindful of cyclops and his human food
and horrid laestrygons the men of blood
presaging tears apace began to rain
but tears in mortal miseries are vain
in equal parts i straight divide my band
and name a chief each party to command
i led the one and of the other side
appointed brave eurylochus the guide
then in the brazen helm the lots we throw
and fortune casts eurylochus to go
he marchd with twice eleven in his train
pensive they march and pensive we remain

the palace in a woody vale they found
high raised of stone a shaded space around
where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam
 familiar to the dome
with gentle blandishment our men they meet
and wag their tails and fawning lick their feet
as from some feast a man returning late
his faithful dogs all meet him at the gate
rejoicing round some morsel to receive

domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near
they gaze with wonder not unmixd with fear
now on the threshold of the dome they stood
and heard a voice resounding through the wood
placed at her loom within the goddess sung
the vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung
oer the fair web the rising figures shine
immortal labour worthy hands divine
polites to the rest the question moved


what voice celestial chanting to the loom
 echoes from the room
say shall we seek access with that they call
and wide unfold the portals of the hall

the goddess rising asks her guests to stay
who blindly follow where she leads the way
eurylochus alone of all the band
suspecting fraud more prudently remaind
on thrones around with downy coverings graced
with semblance fair the unhappy men she placed
milk newly pressd the sacred flour of wheat
and honey fresh and pramnian wines the treat
but venomd was the bread and mixd the bowl
with drugs of force to darken all the soul
soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost
and drank oblivion of their native coast
instant her circling wand the goddess waves
to hogs transforms them and the sty receives
no more was seen the human form divine
head face and members bristle into swine
still cursed with sense their minds remain alone
and their own voice affrights them when they groan
meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows
the mast and acorn brutal food and strows
the fruits and cornel as their feast around
now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground

eurylochus with pensive steps and slow
aghast returns the messenger of woe
and bitter fate to speak he made essay
in vain essayd nor would his tongue obey
his swelling heart denied the words their way
but speaking tears the want of words supply
and the full soul bursts copious from his eye
affrighted anxious for our fellows fates
we press to hear what sadly he relates

we went ulysses 
through the lone thicket and the desert land
a palace in a woody vale we found
brown with dark forests and with shades around
a voice celestial echoed through the dome
or nymph or goddess chanting to the loom
access we sought nor was access denied
radiant she came the portals opend wide
the goddess mild invites the guests to stay
they blindly follow where she leads the way
i only wait behind of all the train
i waited long and eyed the doors in vain
the rest are vanishd none repassd the gate
and not a man appears to tell their fate

i heard and instant oer my shoulder flung
the belt in which my weighty falchion hung
 then seized the bended bow
and bade him guide the way resolved to go
he prostrate falling with both hands embraced
my knees and weeping thus his suit addressd

o king beloved of jove thy servant spare
and ah thyself the rash attempt forbear
never alas thou never shalt return
or see the wretched for whose loss we mourn
with what remains from certain ruin fly
and save the few not fated yet to die

i answerd stern inglorious then remain
here feast and loiter and desert thy train
alone unfriended will i tempt my way
the laws of fate compel and i obey
this said and scornful turning from the shore
my haughty step i stalkd the valley oer
till now approaching nigh the magic bower
where dwelt the enchantress skilld in herbs of power
a form divine forth issued from the wood

in human semblance on his bloomy face
youth smiled celestial with each opening grace
he seized my hand and gracious thus began
ah whither roamst thou muchenduring man
o blind to fate what led thy steps to rove
the horrid mazes of this magic grove
each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies
all lost their form and habitants of sties
thinkst thou by wit to model their escape
sooner shalt thou a stranger to thy shape
fall prone their equal first thy danger know
then take the antidote the gods bestow
the plant i give through all the direful bower
shall guard thee and avert the evil hour
now hear her wicked arts before thy eyes
the bowl shall sparkle and the banquet rise
take this nor from the faithless feast abstain
for temperd drugs and poison shall be vain
soon as she strikes her wand and gives the word
draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword
and menace death those menaces shall move
her alterd mind to blandishment and love
nor shun the blessing profferd to thy arms
ascend her bed and taste celestial charms
so shall thy tedious toils a respite find
and thy lost friends return to human kind
but swear her first by those dread oaths that tie
the powers below the blessed in the sky
lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant
or magic bind thee cold and impotent

thus while he spoke the sovereign plant he drew
where on the allbearing earth unmarkd it grew
and showd its nature and its wondrous power
black was the root but milky white the flower
moly the name to mortals hard to find
but all is easy to the ethereal kind
this hermes gave then gliding off the glade
shot to olympus from the woodland shade
while full of thought revolving fates to come
i speed my passage to the enchanted dome
arrived before the lofty gates i stayd
the lofty gates the goddess wide displayd
she leads before and to the feast invites
i follow sadly to the magic rites
radiant with starry studs a silver seat
received my limbs a footstool eased my feet
she mixd the potion fraudulent of soul
the poison mantled in the golden bowl
i took and quaffd it confident in heaven
then waved the wand and then the word was given
hence to thy fellows 
go be a beasti heard and yet was man

then sudden whirling like a waving flame
my beamy falchion i assault the dame
struck with unusual fear she trembling cries
she faints she falls she lifts her weeping eyes

what art thou say from whence from whom you came
o more than human tell thy race thy name
amazing strength these poisons to sustain
not mortal thou nor mortal is thy brain
or art thou he the man to come 
the man from troy who wanderd ocean round
the man for wisdoms various arts renownd
ulysses oh thy threatening fury cease
sheathe thy bright sword and join our hands in peace
let mutual joys our mutual trust combine
and love and loveborn confidence be thine

and how dread circe 
can love and loveborn confidence be mine
beneath thy charms when my companions groan
transformd to beasts with accents not their own
o thou of fraudful heart shall i be led
to share thy feastrites or ascend thy bed
that all unarmd thy vengeance may have vent
and magic bind me cold and impotent
celestial as thou art yet stand denied
or swear that oath by which the gods are tied
swear in thy soul no latent frauds remain
swear by the vow which never can be vain

the goddess swore then seized my hand and led
to the sweet transports of the genial bed
ministrant to the queen with busy care
four faithful handmaids the soft rites prepare
nymphs sprung from fountains or from shady woods
or the fair offspring of the sacred floods
one oer the couches painted carpets threw
whose purple lustre glowd against the view
white linen lay beneath another placed
the silver stands with golden flaskets graced
with dulcet beverage this the beaker crownd
fair in the midst with gilded cups around
that in the tripod oer the kindled pile
the water pours the bubbling waters boil
an ample vase receives the smoking wave
and in the bath prepared my limbs i lave
reviving sweets repair the minds decay
and take the painful sense of toil away
a vest and tunic oer me next she threw
fresh from the bath and dropping balmy dew
then led and placed me on the sovereign seat
with carpets spread a footstool at my feet
the golden ewer a nymph obsequious brings
replenishd from the cool translucent springs
with copious water the bright vase supplies
a silver laver of capacious size
i washd the table in fair order spread
they heap the glittering canisters with bread
viands of various kinds allure the taste
of choicest sort and savour rich repast
circe in vain invites the feast to share
absent i ponder and absorbd in care
while scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast
the queen beheld me and these words addressd

why sits ulysses silent and apart
some hoard of grief close harbourd at his heart
untouchd before thee stand the cates divine
and unregarded laughs the rosy wine
can yet a doubt or any dread remain
when sworn that oath which never can be vain

i answered goddess human is my breast
by justice swayd by tender pity pressd
ill fits it me whose friends are sunk to beasts
to quaff thy bowls or riot in thy feasts
me wouldst thou please for them thy cares employ
and them to me restore and me to joy

with that she parted in her potent hand
she bore the virtue of the magic wand
then hastening to the sties set wide the door
urged forth and drove the bristly herd before
unwieldy out they rushd with general cry
enormous beasts dishonest to the eye
now touchd by countercharms they change again
and stand majestic and recalld to men
those hairs of late that bristled every part
fall off miraculous effect of art
till all the form in full proportion rise
more young more large more graceful to my eyes
they saw they knew me and with eager pace
clung to their master in a long embrace
sad pleasing sight with tears each eye ran oer
and sobs of joy reechoed through the bower
een circe wept her adamantine heart
felt pity enter and sustaind her part

son of laertes 
oh muchenduring much experienced man
haste to thy vessel on the seabeat shore
unload thy treasures and the galley moor
then bring thy friends secure from future harms
and in our grottoes stow thy spoils and arms

she said obedient to her high command
i quit the place and hasten to the strand
my sad companions on the beach i found
their wistful eyes in floods of sorrow drownd

as from fresh pastures and the dewy field

the lowing herds return around them throng
with leaps and bounds their late imprisond young
rush to their mothers with unruly joy
and echoing hills return the tender cry
so round me pressd exulting at my sight
with cries and agonies of wild delight
the weeping sailors nor less fierce their joy
than if returnd to ithaca from troy
ah master ever honourd ever dear

what other joy can equal thy return
not that loved country for whose sight we mourn
the soil that nursed us and that gave us breath
but ah relate our lost companions death

i answerd cheerful haste your galley moor
and bring our treasures and our arms ashore
those in yon hollow caverns let us lay
then rise and follow where i lead the way
your fellows live believe your eyes and come
to taste the joys of circes sacred dome

with ready speed the joyful crew obey
alone eurylochus persuades their stay

whither  ah whither will ye run
seek ye to meet those evils ye should shun
will you the terrors of the dome explore
in swine to grovel or in lions roar
or wolflike howl away the midnight hour
in dreadful watch around the magic bower
remember cyclops and his bloody deed
the leaders rashness made the soldiers bleed

i heard incensed and first resolved to speed
my flying falchion at the rebels head
dear as he was by ties of kindred bound
this hand had stretchd him breathless on the ground
but all at once my interposing train
for mercy pleaded nor could plead in vain
leave here the man who dares his prince desert
leave to repentance and his own sad heart
to guard the ship seek we the sacred shades
of circes palace where ulysses leads

this with one voice declared the rising train
left the black vessel by the murmuring main
shame touchd eurylochus alterd breast
he feard my threats and followd with the rest

meanwhile the goddess with indulgent cares
and social joys the late transformd repairs
the bath the feast their fainting soul renews
rich in refulgent robes and dropping balmy dews
brightening with joy their eager eyes behold
each others face and each his story told
then gushing tears the narrative confound
and with their sobs the vaulted roof resound
when hushd their passion thus the goddess cries
ulysses taught by labours to be wise
let this short memory of grief suffice
to me are known the various woes ye bore
in storms by sea in perils on the shore
forget whatever was in fortunes power
and share the pleasures of this genial hour
such be your mind as ere ye left your coast
or learnd to sorrow for a country lost
exiles and wanderers now whereer ye go
too faithful memory renews your woe
the cause removed habitual griefs remain
and the soul saddens by the use of pain

her kind entreaty moved the general breast
tired with long toil we willing sunk to rest
we plied the banquet and the bowl we crownd
till the full circle of the year came round
but when the seasons following in their train
brought back the months the days and hours again
as from a lethargy at once they rise
and urge their chief with animating cries

is this ulysses our inglorious lot
and is the name of ithaca forgot
shall never the dear land in prospect rise
or the loved palace glitter in our eyes
melting i heard yet till the suns decline
prolongd the feast and quaffd the rosy wine
but when the shades came on at evening hour
and all lay slumbering in the dusky bower
i came a suppliant to fair circes bed
the tender moment seized and thus i said
be mindful goddess of thy promise made
must sad ulysses ever be delayd
around their lord my sad companions mourn
each breast beats homeward anxious to return
if but a moment parted from thy eyes
their tears flow round me and my heart complies

go then  ah go yet think not i
not circe but the fates your wish deny
ah hope not yet to breathe thy native air
far other journey first demands thy care
to tread the uncomfortable paths beneath
and view the realms of darkness and of death
there seek the theban bard deprived of sight
within irradiate with prophetic light
to whom persephone entire and whole
gave to retain the unseparated soul
the rest are forms of empty ether made
impassive semblance and a flitting shade

struck at the word my very heart was dead
pensive i sate my tears bedewd the bed
to hate the light and life my soul begun
and saw that all was grief beneath the sun
composed at length the gushing tears suppressd
and my tossd limbs now wearied into rest
how shall i tread  ah circe say
the dark descent and who shall guide the way
can living eyes behold the realms below
what bark to waft me and what wind to blow

thy fated road 
divine ulysses ask no mortal guide
rear but the mast the spacious sail display
the northern winds shall wing thee on thy way
soon shalt thou reach old oceans utmost ends
where to the main the shelving shore descends
the barren trees of proserpines black woods
poplars and willows trembling oer the floods
there fix thy vessel in the lonely bay
and enter there the kingdoms void of day
where phlegethons loud torrents rushing down
hiss in the flaming gulf of acheron
and where slow rolling from the stygian bed
cocytus lamentable waters spread
where the dark rock oerhangs the infernal lake
and mingling streams eternal murmurs make
first draw thy falchion and on every side
trench the black earth a cubit long and wide
to all the shades around libations pour
and oer the ingredients strew the hallowd flour
new wine and milk with honey temperd bring
and living water from the crystal spring
then the wan shades and feeble ghosts implore
with promised offerings on thy native shore
a barren cow the stateliest of the isle
and heapd with various wealth a blazing pile
these to the rest but to the seer must bleed
a sable ram the pride of all thy breed
these solemn vows and holy offerings paid
to all the phantom nations of the dead
be next thy care the sable sheep to place
full oer the pit and hellward turn their face
but from the infernal rite thine eye withdraw
and back to ocean glance with reverend awe
sudden shall skim along the dusky glades
thin airy shoals and visionary shades
then give command the sacrifice to haste
let the flayd victims in the flame be cast
and sacred vows and mystic song applied
to grisly pluto and his gloomy bride
wide oer the pool thy falchion waved around
shall drive the spectres from unbidden ground
the sacred draught shall all the dead forbear
till awful from the shades arise the seer
let him oraculous the end the way
the turns of all thy future fate display
thy pilgrimage to come and remnant of thy day

so speaking from the ruddy orient shone
the morn conspicuous on her golden throne
the goddess with a radiant tunic dressd
my limbs and oer me cast a silken vest
long flowing robes of purest white array
the nymph that added lustre to the day
a tiar wreathd her head with many a fold
her waist was circled with a zone of gold
forth issuing then from place to place i flew
rouse man by man and animate my crew
rise rise my mates tis circe gives command
our journey calls us haste and quit the land
all rise and follow yet depart not all
for fate decreed one wretched man to fall

a youth there was elpenor was he named
not much for sense nor much for courage famed
the youngest of our band a vulgar soul
born but to banquet and to drain the bowl
he hot and careless on a turrets height
with sleep repaird the long debauch of night
the sudden tumult stirred him where he lay
and down he hastend but forgot the way
full headlong from the roof the sleeper fell
and snappd the spinal joint and waked in hell

the rest crowd round me with an eager look
i met them with a sigh and thus bespoke
already friends ye think your toils are oer
your hopes already touch your native shore
alas far otherwise the nymph declares
far other journey first demands our cares
to tread the uncomfortable paths beneath
the dreary realms of darkness and of death
to seek tiresias awful shade below
and thence our fortunes and our fates to know

my sad companions heard in deep despair
frantic they tore their manly growth of hair
to earth they fell the tears began to rain
but tears in mortal miseries are vain
sadly they fared along the seabeat shore
still heaved their hearts and still their eyes ran oer
the ready victims at our bark we found
the sable ewe and ram together bound
for swift as thought the goddess had been there
and thence had glided viewless as the air
the paths of gods what mortal can survey
who eyes their motion who shall trace their way







now to the shores we bend a mournful train
climb the tall bark and launch into the main
at once the mast we rear at once unbind
the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
then pale and pensive stand with cares oppressd
and solemn horror saddens every breast
a freshening breeze the magic power supplied
while the wingd vessel flew along the tide
our oars we shippd all day the swelling sails
full from the guiding pilot catchd the gales

now sunk the sun from his aërial height
and oer the shaded billows rushd the night
when lo we reachd old oceans utmost bounds
where rocks control his waves with everduring mounds

there in a lonely land and gloomy cells
the dusky nation of cimmeria dwells
the sun neer views the uncomfortable seats
when radiant he advances or retreats
unhappy race whom endless night invades
clouds the dull air and wraps them round in shades

the ship we moor on these obscure abodes
disbark the sheep an offering to the gods
and hellward bending oer the beach descry
the doleful passage to the infernal sky
the victims vowd to each tartarian power
eurylochus and perimedes bore

here opend hell all hell i here implored
and from the scabbard drew the shining sword
and trenching the black earth on every side
a cavern formd a cubit long and wide
new wine with honeytemperd milk we bring
then living waters from the crystal spring
oer these was strewd the consecrated flour
and on the surface shone the holy store

now the wan shades we hail the infernal gods
to speed our course and waft us oer the floods
so shall a barren heifer from the stall
beneath the knife upon your altars fall
so in our palace at our safe return
rich with unnumberd gifts the pile shall burn
so shall a ram the largest of the breed
black as these regions to tiresias bleed

thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid
to all the phantomnations of the dead
then died the sheep a purple torrent flowd
and all the caverns smoked with streaming blood
when lo appeard along the dusky coasts
thin airy shoals of visionary ghosts
fair pensive youths and soft enamourd maids
and witherd elders pale and wrinkled shades
ghastly with wounds the forms of warriors slain
stalkd with majestic port a martial train
these and a thousand more swarmd oer the ground
and all the dire assembly shriekd around
astonishd at the sight aghast i stood
and a cold fear ran shivering through my blood
straight i command the sacrifice to haste
straight the flayd victims to the flames are cast
and mutterd vows and mystic song applied
to grisly pluto and his gloomy bride

now swift i waved my falchion oer the blood
back started the pale throngs and trembling stood
round the black trench the gore untasted flows
till awful from the shades tiresias rose

there wandering through the gloom i first surveyd
new to the realms of death elpenors shade
his cold remains all naked to the sky
on distant shores unwept unburied lie
sad at the sight i stand deep fixd in woe
and ere i spoke the tears began to flow

o say what angry power elpenor led
to glide in shades and wander with the dead
how could thy soul by realms and seas disjoind
outfly the nimble sail and leave the lagging wind

the ghost replied to hell my doom i owe
demons accursed dire ministers of woe
my feet through wine unfaithful to their weight
betrayd me tumbling from a towery height
staggering i reeld and as i reeld i fell
luxd the neckjointmy soul descends to hell
but lend me aid i now conjure thee lend
by the soft tie and sacred name of friend
by thy fond consort by thy fathers cares
by loved telemachus blooming years
for well i know that soon the heavenly powers
will give thee back today and circes shores
there pious on my cold remains attend
there call to mind thy poor departed friend
the tribute of a tear is all i crave
and the possession of a peaceful grave
but if unheard in vain compassion plead
revere the gods the gods avenge the dead
a tomb along the watery margin raise
the tomb with manly arms and trophies grace
to show posterity elpenor was
there high in air memorial of my name
fix the smooth oar and bid me live to fame

to whom with tears these rites o mournful shade
due to thy ghost shall to thy ghost be paid

still as i spoke the phantom seemd to moan
tear followd tear and groan succeeded groan
but as my waving sword the blood surrounds
the shade withdrew and mutterd empty sounds

there as the wondrous visions i surveyd
all pale ascends my royal mothers shade
a queen to troy she saw our legions pass
now a thin form is all anticlea was
struck at the sight i melt with filial woe
and down my cheek the pious sorrows flow
yet as i shook my falchion oer the blood
regardless of her son the parent stood

when lo the mighty theban i behold
to guide his steps he bore a staff of gold
awful he trod majestic was his look
and from his holy lips these accents broke

why mortal wanderest thou from cheerful day
to tread the downward melancholy way
what angry gods to these dark regions led
thee yet alive companion of the dead
but sheathe thy poniard while my tongue relates
heavens steadfast purpose and thy future fates

while yet he spoke the prophet i obeyd
and in the scabbard plunged the glittering blade
eager he quaffd the gore and then expressd
dark things to come the counsels of his breast

weary of light ulysses here explores
a prosperous voyage to his native shores
but knowby me unerring fates disclose
new trains of dangers and new scenes of woes
i see i see thy bark by neptune tossd
for injured cyclops and his eyeball lost
yet to thy woes the gods decree an end
if heaven thou please and how to please attend
where on trinacrian rocks the ocean roars
graze numerous herds along the verdant shores
though hunger press yet fly the dangerous prey
the herds are sacred to the god of day
who all surveys with his extensive eye
above below on earth and in the sky
rob not the god and so propitious gales
attend thy voyage and impel thy sails
but if his herds ye seize beneath the waves
i see thy friends oerwhelmd in liquid graves
the direful wreck ulysses scarce survives
ulysses at his country scarce arrives
strangers thy guides nor there thy labours end
new foes arise domestic ills attend
there foul adulterers to thy bride resort
and lordly gluttons riot in thy court
but vengeance hastes amain these eyes behold
the deathful scene princes on princes rolld
that done a people far from sea explore
who neer knew salt or heard the billows roar
or saw gay vessel stem the watery plain
a painted wonder flying on the main
bear on thy back an oar with strange amaze
a shepherd meeting thee the oar surveys
and names a van there fix it on the plain
to calm the god that holds the watery reign
a threefold offering to his altar bring
a bull a ram a boar and hail the ocean king
but home returnd to each ethereal power
slay the due victim in the genial hour
so peaceful shalt thou end thy blissful days
and steal thyself from life by slow decays
unknown to pain in age resign thy breath
when late stern neptune points the shaft with death
to the dark grave retiring as to rest
thy people blessing by thy people blessd

unerring truths o man my lips relate
this is thy life to come and this is fate

to whom unmoved if this the gods prepare
what heaven ordains the wise with courage bear
but say why yonder on the lonely strands
unmindful of her son anticlea stands
why to the ground she bends her downcast eye
why is she silent while her son is nigh
the latent cause o sacred seer reveal

nor this  will i conceal
know to the spectres that thy beverage taste
the scenes of life recur and actions past
they seald with truth return the sure reply
the rest repelld a train oblivious fly

the phantomprophet ceased and sunk from sight
to the black palace of eternal night

still in the dark abodes of death i stood
when near anticlea moved and drank the blood
straight all the mother in her soul awakes
and owning her ulysses thus she speaks
comest thou my son alive to realms beneath
the dolesome realms of darkness and of death
comest thou alive from pure ethereal day
dire is the region dismal is the way
here lakes profound there floods oppose their waves
there the wide sea with all his billows raves
or 
comest thou a wanderer from the phrygian shores
or say since honour calld thee to the field
hast thou thy ithaca thy bride beheld

source of my life i cried from earth i fly
to seek tiresias in the nether sky
to learn my doom for tossd from woe to woe
in every land ulysses finds a foe
nor have these eyes beheld my native shores
since in the dust proud troy submits her towers

but when thy soul from her sweet mansion fled
say what distemper gave thee to the dead
has lifes fair lamp declined by slow decays
or swift expired it in a sudden blaze
say if my sire good old laertes lives
if yet telemachus my son survives
say by his rule is my dominion awed
or crushd by traitors with an iron rod
say if my spouse maintains her royal trust
though tempted chaste and obstinately just
or if no more her absent lord she wails
but the false woman oer the wife prevails

thus i and thus the parentshade returns
thee ever thee thy faithful consort mourns
whether the night descends or day prevails
thee she by night and thee by day bewails
thee in telemachus thy realm obeys
in sacred groves celestial rites he pays
and shares the banquet in superior state
graced with such honours as become the great
thy sire in solitude foments his care
the court is joyless for thou art not there
no costly carpets raise his hoary head
no rich embroidery shines to grace his bed
even when keen winter freezes in the skies
rankd with his slaves on earth the monarch lies
deep are his sighs his visage pale his dress
the garb of woe and habit of distress
and when the autumn takes his annual round
the leafy honours scattering on the ground
regardless of his years abroad he lies
his bed the leaves his canopy the skies
thus cares on cares his painful days consume
and bow his age with sorrow to the tomb

for thee my son i wept my life away
for thee through hells eternal dungeons stray
nor came my fate by lingering pains and slow
nor bent the silvershafted queen her bow
no dire disease bereaved me of my breath
thou thou my son wert my disease and death
unkindly with my love my son conspired
for thee i lived for absent thee expired

thrice in my arms i strove her shade to bind
thrice through my arms she slippd like empty wind
or dreams the vain illusions of the mind
wild with despair i shed a copious tide
of flowing tears and thus with sighs replied

fliest thou loved shade while i thus fondly mourn
turn to my arms to my embraces turn
is it ye powers that smile at human harms
too great a bliss to weep within her arms
or has hells queen an empty image sent
that wretched i might een my joys lament

o son of woe the pensive shade rejoind
o most inured to grief of all mankind
tis not the queen of hell who thee deceives
all all are such when life the body leaves
no more the substance of the man remains
nor bounds the blood along the purple veins
these the funereal flames in atoms bear
to wander with the wind in empty air
while the impassive soul reluctant flies
like a vain dream to these infernal skies
but from the dark dominions speed the way
and climb the steep ascent to upper day
to thy chaste bride the wondrous story tell
the woes the horrors and the laws of hell

thus while she spoke in swarms hells empress brings
daughters and wives of heroes and of kings
thick and more thick they gather round the blood
ghost thronged on ghost  stood
dauntless my sword i seize the airy crew
swift as it flashd along the gloom withdrew
then shade to shade in mutual forms succeeds
her race recounts and their illustrious deeds

tyro began whom great salmoneus bred
the royal partner of famed cretheus bed
for fair enipeus as from fruitful urns
he pours his watery store the virgin burns
smooth flows the gentle stream with wanton pride
and in soft mazes rolls a silver tide
as on his banks the maid enamourd roves
the monarch of the deep beholds and loves
in her enipeus form and borrowd charms
the amorous god descends into her arms
around a spacious arch of waves he throws
and high in air the liquid mountain rose
thus in surrounding floods conceald he proves
the pleasing transport and completes his loves
then softly sighing he the fair addressd
and as he spoke her tender hand he pressd
hail happy nymph no vulgar births are owed
to the prolific raptures of a god
lo when nine times the moon renews her horn
two brother heroes shall from thee be born
thy early care the future worthies claim
to point them to the arduous paths of fame
but in thy breast the important truth conceal
nor dare the secret of a god reveal
for know thou neptune viewst and at my nod
earth trembles and the waves confess their god

he added not but mounting spurnd the plain
then plunged into the chambers of the main

now in the times full process forth she brings
joves dread vicegerents in two future kings
oer proud iolcos pelias stretchd his reign
and godlike neleus ruled the pylian plain
then fruitful to her cretheus royal bed
she gallant pheres and famed aeson bred
from the same fountain amythaon rose
pleased with the din of scar and noble shout of foes

there moved antiope with haughty charms
who blessd the almighty thunderer in her arms
hence sprung amphion hence brave zethus came
founders of thebes and men of mighty name
though bold in open field they yet surround
the town with walls and mound inject on mound
here ramparts stood there towers rose high in air
and here through seven wide portals rushd the war

there with soft step the fair alcmena trod
who bore alcides to the thundering god
and megara who charmd the son of jove
and softend his stern soul to tender love

sullen and sour with discontented mien
jocasta frownd the incestuous theban queen
with her own son she joind in nuptial bands
though fathers blood imbrued his murderous hands
the gods and men the dire offence detest
the gods with all their furies rend his breast
in lofty thebes he wore the imperial crown
a pompous wretch accursed upon a throne
the wife selfmurderd from a beam depends
and her foul soul to blackest hell descends
thence to her son the choicest plagues she brings
and the fiends haunt him with a thousand stings

and now the beauteous chloris i descry
a lovely shade amphions youngest joy
with gifts unnumberd neleus sought her arms
nor paid too dearly for unequalld charms
great in orchomenos in pylos great
he swayd the sceptre with imperial state
three gallant sons the joyful monarch told
sage nestor periclimenus the bold
and chromius last but of the softer race
one nymph alone a myracle of grace
kings on their thrones for lovely pero burn
the sire denies and kings rejected mourn
to him alone the beauteous prize he yields
whose arm should ravish from phylacian fields
the herds of iphyclus detaind in wrong
wild furious herds unconquerably strong
this dares a seer but nought the seer prevails
in beautys cause illustriously he fails
twelve moons the foe the captive youth detains
in painful dungeons and coercive chains
the foe at last from durance where he lay
his heart revering give him back to day
won by prophetic knowledge to fulfil
the steadfast purpose of the almighty will

with graceful port advancing now i spied
leda the fair the godlike tyndars bride
hence pollux sprung who wields the furious sway
the deathful gauntlet matchless in the fray
and castor glorious on the embattled plain
curbs the proud steeds reluctant to the rein
by turns they visit this ethereal sky
and live alternate and alternate die
in hell beneath on earth in heaven above
reign the twingods the favourite sons of jove

there ephimedia trod the gloomy plain
who charmd the monarch of the boundless main
hence ephialtes hence stern otus sprung
more fierce than giants more than giants strong
the earth oerburdend groand beneath their weight
none but orion eer surpassed their height
the wondrous youths had scarce nine winters told
when high in air tremendous to behold
nine ells aloft they reard their towering head
and full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread
proud of their strength and more than mortal size
the gods they challenge and affect the skies
heaved on olympus tottering ossa stood
on ossa pelion nods with all his wood
such were they youths had they to manhood grown
almighty jove had trembled on his throne
but ere the harvest of the beard began
to bristle on the chin and promise man
his shafts apollo aimd at once they sound
and stretch the giant monsters oer the ground

there mournful phaedra with sad procris moves
both beauteous shades both hapless in their loves
and near them walkd with solemn pace and slow
sad adriadne partner of their woe
the royal minos ariadne bred
she theseus loved from crete with theseus fled
swift to the dian isle the hero flies
and towards his athens bears the lovely prize
there bacchus with fierce rage diana fires
the goddess aims her shaft the nymph expires

there clymene and mera i behold
there eriphyle weeps who loosely sold
her lord her honour for the lust of gold
but should i all recount the night would fail
unequal to the melancholy tale
and allcomposing rest my nature craves
here in the court or yonder on the waves
in you i trust and in the heavenly powers
to land ulysses on his native shores

he ceased but left so charming on their ear
his voice that listening still they seemd to hear
till rising up arete silence broke
stretchd out her snowy hand and thus she spoke

what wondrous man heaven sends us in our guest
through all his woes the hero shines confessd
his comely port his ample frame express
a manly air majestic in distress
he as my guest is my peculiar care
you share the pleasure then in bounty share
to worth in misery a reverence pay
and with a generous hand reward his stay
for since kind heaven with wealth our realm has blessd
give it to heaven by aiding the distressd

then sage echeneus whose grave reverend brow
the hand of time had silvered oer with snow
mature in wisdom rose your words 
demand obedience for your words are wise
but let our king direct the glorious way
to generous acts our part is to obey

while life informs these limbs 
well to deserve be all my cares employed
but here this night the royal guest detain
till the sun flames along the ethereal plain
be it my task to send with ample stores
the stranger from our hospitable shores
tread you my steps tis mine to lead the race
the first in glory as the first in place

to whom the prince this night with joy i stay
o monarch great in virtue as in sway
if thou the circling year my stay control
to raise a bounty noble as thy soul
the circling year i wait with ampler stores
and fitter pomp to hail my native shores
then by my realms due homage would be paid
for wealthy kings are loyally obeyed

o king for such thou art and sure thy blood
through veins  of royal fathers flowd
unlike those vagrants who on falsehood live
skilld in smooth tales and artful to deceive
thy better soul abhors the liars part
wise is thy voice and noble is thy heart
thy words like music every breast control
steal through the ear and win upon the soul
soft as some song divine thy story flows
nor better could the muse record thy woes

but say upon the dark and dismal coast
sawst thou the worthies of the grecian host
the godlike leaders who in battle slain
fell before troy and nobly pressd the plain
and lo a length of night behind remains
the evening stars still mount the ethereal plains
thy tale with raptures i could hear thee tell
thy woes on earth the wondrous scenes in hell
till in the vault of heaven the stars decay
and the sky reddens with the rising day

o worthy of the power the gods assignd
 a king in mind
since yet the early hour of night allows
time for discourse and time for soft repose
if scenes of misery can entertain
woes i unfold of woes a dismal train
prepare to hear of murder and of blood
of godlike heroes who uninjured stood
amidst a war of spears in foreign lands
yet bled at home and bled by female hands

now summond proserpine to hells black hall
the heroine shades they vanishd at her call
when lo advanced the forms of heroes slain
by stern aegysthus a majestic train
and high above the rest atrides pressd the plain
he quaffd the gore and straight his soldier knew
and from his eyes pourd down the tender dew
his arms he stretchd his arms the touch deceive
nor in the fond embrace embraces give
his substance vanishd and his strength decayd
now all atrides is an empty shade

moved at the sight i for a apace resignd
to soft affliction all my manly mind
at last with tears o what relentless doom
imperial phantom bowd thee to the tomb
say while the sea and while the tempest raves
has fate oppressd thee in the roaring waves
or nobly seized thee in the dire alarms
of war and slaughter and the clash of arms

the ghost returns o chief of human kind
for active courage and a patient mind
nor while the sea nor while the tempest raves
has fate oppressd me on the roaring waves
nor nobly seized me in the dire alarms
of war and slaughter and the clash of arms
stabbd by a murderous hand atrides died
a foul adulterer and a faithless bride
een in my mirth and at the friendly feast
oer the full bowl the traitor stabbd his guest
thus by the gory arm of slaughter falls
the stately ox and bleeds within the stalls
but not with me the direful murder ends
these these expired their crime they were my friends
thick as the boars which some luxurious lord
kills for the feast to crown the nuptial board
when war has thunderd with its loudest storms
death thou hast seen in all her ghastly forms
in duel met her on the listed ground
when hand to hand they wound return for wound
but never have the eyes astonishd viewd
so vile a deed so dire a scene of blood
een in the flow of joy when now the bowl
glows in our veins and opens every soul
we groan we faint with blood the doom is dyed
and oer the pavement floats the dreadful tide
her breast all gore with lamentable cries
the bleeding innocent cassandra dies
then though pale death froze cold in every vein
my sword i strive to wield but strive in vain
nor did my traitress wife these eyelids close
or decently in death my limbs compose
o woman woman when to ill thy mind
is bent all hell contains no fouler fiend
and such was mine who basely plunged her sword
through the fond bosom where she reignd adored
alas i hoped the toils of war oercome
to meet soft quiet and repose at home
delusive hope o wife thy deeds disgrace
the perjured sex and blacken all the race
and should posterity one virtuous find
name clytemnestra they will curse the kind

oh injured shade  what mighty woes
to thy imperial race from woman rose
by woman here thou treadst this mournful strand
and greece by woman lies a desert land

warnd by my ills beware 
nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise
when earnest to explore thy secret breast
unfold some trifle but conceal the rest
but in thy consort cease to fear a foe
for thee she feels sincerity of woe
when troy first bled beneath the grecian arms
she shone unrivalld with a blaze of charms
thy infant son her fragrant bosom pressd
hung at her knee or wantond at her breast
but now the years a numerous train have ran
the blooming boy is ripend into man
thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire
the sire shall bless his son the son his sire
but my orestes never met these eyes
without one look the murderd father dies
then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn
een to thy queen disguised unknown return
for since of womankind so few are just
think all are false nor een the faithful trust

but say resides my son in royal port
in rich orchomenos or spartas court
or say in pyle for yet he views the light
nor glides a phantom through the realms of night

then i thy suit is vain nor can i say
if yet he breathes in realms of cheerful day
or pale or wan beholds these nether skies
truth i revere for wisdom never lies

thus in a tide of tears our sorrows flow
and add new horror to the realms of woe
till side by side along the dreary coast
advanced achilles and patroclus ghost
a friendly pair near these the pylian strayd
and towering ajax an illustrious shade
war was his joy and pleased with loud alarms
none but pelides brighter shone in arms

through the thick gloom his friend achilles knew
and as he speaks the tears descend in dew

comest thou alive to view the stygian bounds
where the wan spectres walk eternal rounds
nor fearst the dark and dismal waste to tread
throngd with pale ghosts familiar with the dead

to whom with sighs i pass these dreadful gates
to seek the theban and consult the fates
for still distressd i rove from coast to coast
lost to my friends and to my country lost
but sure the eye of time beholds no name
so blessd as thine in all the rolls of fame
alive we haild thee with our guardian gods
and dead thou rulest a king in these abodes

talk not of ruling in this dolorous gloom
nor think vain words  can ease my doom
rather id choose laboriously to bear
a weight of woes and breathe the vital air
a slave to some poor hind that toils for bread
than reign the sceptred monarch of the dead
but say if in my steps my son proceeds
and emulates his godlike fathers deeds
if at the clash of arms and shout of foes
swells his bold heart his bosom nobly glows
say if my sire the reverend peleus reigns
great in his phthia and his throne maintains
or weak and old my youthful arm demands
to fix the sceptre steadfast in his hands
o might the lamp of life rekindled burn
and death release me from the silent urn
this arm that thunderd oer the phrygian plain
and swelld the ground with mountains of the slain
should vindicate my injured fathers fame
crush the proud rebel and assert his claim

illustrious shade  of peleus fates
no circumstance the voice of fame relates
but hear with pleased attention the renown
the wars and wisdom of thy gallant son
with me from scyros to the field of fame
radiant in arms the blooming hero came
when greece assembled all her hundred states
to ripen counsels and decide debates
heavens how he charmd us with a flow of sense
and won the heart with manly eloquence
he first was seen of all the peers to rise
the third in wisdom where they all were wise
but when to try the fortune of the day
host moved toward host in terrible array
before the van impatient for the fight
with martial port he strode and stern delight
heaps strewd on heaps beneath his falchion groand
and monuments of dead deformd the ground
the time would fail should i in order tell
what foes were vanquishd and what numbers fell
how lost through love eurypylus was slain
and round him bled his bold cetaean train
to troy no hero came of nobler line
or if of nobler memnon it was thine

when ilion in the horse received her doom
and unseen armies ambushd in its womb
greece gave her latent warriors to my care
twas mine on troy to pour the imprisond war
then when the boldest bosom beat with fear
when the stern eyes of heroes droppd a tear
fierce in his look his ardent valour glowd
flushd in his cheek or sallied in his blood
indignant in the dark recess he stands
pants for the battle and the war demands
his voice breathed death and with a martial air
he graspd his sword and shook his glittering spear
and when the gods our arms with conquest crownd
when troys proud bulwarks smoked upon the ground
greece to reward her soldiers gallant toils
heapd high his navy with unnumberd spoils

thus great in glory from the din of war
safe he returnd without one hostile scar
though spears in iron tempests raind around
yet innocent they playd and guiltless of a wound

while yet i spoke the shade with transport glowd
rose in his majesty and nobler trod
with haughty stalk he sought the distant glades
of warrior kings and joind the illustrious shades

now without number ghost by ghost arose
all wailing with unutterable woes
alone apart in discontented mood
a gloomy shade the sullen ajax stood
for ever sad with proud disdain he pined
and the lost arms for ever stung his mind
though to the contest thetis gave the laws
and pallas by the trojans judged the cause
o why was i victorious in the strife
o dear bought honour with so brave a life
with him the strength of war the soldiers pride
our second hope to great achilles died
touchd at the sight from tears i scarce refrain
and tender sorrow thrills in every vein
pensive and sad i stand at length accost
with accents mild the inexorable ghost
still burns thy rage and can brave souls resent
een after death relent great shade relent
perish those arms which by the gods decree
accursed our army with the loss of thee
with thee we fall greece wept thy hapless fates
and shook astonishd through her hundred states
not more when great achilles pressd the ground
and breathed his manly spirit through the wound
o deem thy fall not owed to mans decree
jove hated greece and punishd greece in thee
turn then oh peaceful turn thy wrath control
and calm the raging tempest of thy soul

while yet i speak the shade disdains to stay
in silence turns and sullen stalks away

touchd at his sour retreat through deepest night
through hells black bounds i had pursued his flight
and forced the stubborn spectre to reply
but wondrous visions drew my curious eye
high on a throne tremendous to behold
stern minos waves a mace of burnishd gold
around ten thousand thousand spectres stand
through the wide dome of dis a trembling band
still as they plead the fatal lots he rolls
absolves the just and dooms the guilty souls

the huge orion of portentous size
swift through the gloom a gianthunter flies
a ponderous mace of brass with direful sway
aloft he whirls to crush the savage prey
stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell
now grisly forms shoot oer the lawns of hell

there tityus large and long in fetters bound
oerspreads nine acres of infernal ground
two ravenous vultures furious for their food
scream oer the fiend and riot in his blood
incessant gore the liver in his breast
the immortal liver grows and gives the immortal feast
for as oer panopes enamelld plains
latona journeyd to the pythian fanes
with haughty love the audacious monster strove
to force the goddess and to rival jove

there tantalus along the stygian bounds
pours out deep groans 
een in the circling floods refreshment craves
and pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves
when to the water he his lip applies
back from his lip the treacherous water flies
above beneath around his hapless head
trees of all kinds delicious fruitage spread
there figs skydyed a purple hue disclose
green looks the olive the pomegranate glows
there dangling pears exalting scents unfold
and yellow apples ripen into gold
the fruit he strives to seize but blasts arise
toss it on high and whirl it to the skies

i turnd my eye and as i turnd surveyd
a mournful vision the sisyphian shade
with many a weary step and many a groan
up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone
the huge round stone resulting with a bound
thunders impetuous down and smokes along the ground
again the restless orb his toil renews
dust mounts in clouds and sweat descends in dews

now i the strength of hercules behold
a towering spectre of gigantic mould
a shadowy form for high in heavens abodes
himself resides a god among the gods
there in the bright assemblies of the skies
he nectar quaffs and hebe crowns his joys
here hovering ghosts like fowl his shade surround
and clang their pinions with terrific sound
gloomy as night he stands in act to throw
the aërial arrow from the twanging bow
around his breast a wondrous zone is rolld
where woodland monsters grin in fretted gold
there sullen lions sternly seem to roar
the bear to growl to foam the tusky boar
there war and havoc and destruction stood
and vengeful murder red with human blood
thus terribly adorned the figures shine
inimitably wrought with skill divine
the mighty good advanced with awful look
and turning his grim visage sternly spoke

o exercise in grief by arts refined
o taught to bear the wrongs of base mankind
such such was i still tossd from care to care
while in your world i drew the vital air
een i who from the lord of thunders rose
bore toils and dangers and a weight of woes
to a base monarch still a slave confined

down to these worlds i trod the dismal way
and draggd the threemouthd dog to upper day
een hell i conquerd through the friendly aid
of maias offspring and the martial maid

thus he nor deignd for our reply to stay
but turning stalkd with giantstrides away

curious to view the kings of ancient days
the mighty dead that live in endless praise
resolved i stand and haply had surveyd
the godlike theseus and pirithous shade
but swarms of spectres rose from deepest hell
with bloodless visage and with hideous yell
they scream they shriek and groans and dismal sounds
stun my scared ears and pierce hells utmost bounds
no more my heart the dismal din sustains
and my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins
lest gorgon rising from the infernal lakes
with horrors armd and curls of hissing snakes
should fix me stiffend at the monstrous sight
a stony image in eternal night
straight from the direful coast to purer air
i speed my flight and to my mates repair
my mates ascend the ship they strike their oars
the mountains lessen and retreat the shores
swift oer the waves we fly the freshening gales
sing through the shrouds and stretch the swelling sails






thus oer the rolling surge the vessel flies
till from the waves the ææan hills arise
here the gay morn resides in radiant bowers
here keeps her revels with the dancing hours
here phœbus rising in the ethereal way
through heavens bright portals pours the beamy day
at once we fix our halsers on the land
at once descend and press the desert sand
there worn and wasted lose our cares in sleep
to the hoarse murmurs of the rolling deep

soon as the morn restored the day we paid
sepulchral honours to elpenors shade
now by the axe the rushing forest bends
and the huge pile along the shore ascends
around we stand a melancholy train
and a loud groan reechoes from the main
fierce oer the pyre by fanning breezes spread
the hungry flames devour the silent dead
a rising tomb the silent dead to grace
fast by the roarings of the main we place
the rising tomb a lofty column bore
and high above it rose the tapering oar

meantime the goddess our return surveyd
from the pale ghosts and hells tremendous shade
swift she descends a train of nymphs divine
bear the rich viands and the generous wine
in act to speak the power of magic stands
and graceful thus accosts the listening bands

o sons of woe decreed by adverse fates
alive to pass through hells eternal gates
all soon or late are doomd that path to tread
more wretched you twice numberd with the dead
this day adjourn your cares exalt your souls
indulge the taste and drain the sparkling bowls
and when the morn unveils her saffron ray
spread your broad sails and plough the liquid way
lo i this night your faithful guide explain
your woes by land your dangers on the main

the goddess spoke in feasts we waste the day
till phœbus downward plunged his burning ray
then sable night ascends and balmy rest
seals every eye and calms the troubled breast
then curious she commands me to relate
the dreadful scenes of plutos dreary state
she sat in silence while the tale i tell
the wondrous visions and the laws of hell

then thus the lot of man the gods dispose
these ills are past now hear thy future woes
o prince attend some favouring power be kind
and print the important story on thy mind

next where the sirens dwell you plough the seas
their song is death and makes destruction please
unblest the man whom music wins to stay
nigh the cursed shore and listen to the lay
no more that wretch shall view the joys of life
his blooming offspring or his beauteous wife
in verdant meads they sport and wide around
lie human bones that whiten all the ground
the ground polluted floats with human gore
and human carnage taints the dreadful shore
fly swift the dangerous coast let every ear
be stoppd against the song tis death to hear
firm to the mast with chains thyself be bound
nor trust thy virtue to the enchanting sound
if mad with transport freedom thou demand
be every fetter straind and added band to band

these seas oerpassd be wise but i refrain
to mark distinct thy voyage oer the main
new horrors rise let prudence be thy guide
and guard thy various passage through the tide

high oer the main two rocks exalt their brow
the boiling billows thundering roll below
through the vast waves the dreadful wonders move
hence named erratic by the gods above
no bird of air no dove of swiftest wing
that bears ambrosia to the ethereal king
shuns the dire rocks in vain she cuts the skies
the dire rocks meet and crush her as she flies
not the fleet bark when prosperous breezes play
ploughs oer that roaring surge its desperate way
oerwhelmd it sinks while round a smoke expires
and the waves flashing seem to burn with fires
scarce the famed argo passd these raging floods
the sacred argo filld with demigods
een she had sunk but joves imperial bride
wingd her fleet sail and pushd her oer the tide

high in the air the rock its summit shrouds
in brooding tempests and in rolling clouds
loud storms around and mists eternal rise
beat its bleak brow and intercept the skies
when all the broad expansion bright with day
glows with the autumnal or the summer ray
the summer and the autumn glow in vain
the sky for ever lowers for ever clouds remain
impervious to the step of man it stands
though borne by twenty feet though armd with twenty hands
smooth as the polish of the mirror rise
the slippery sides and shoot into the skies
full in the centre of this rock displayd
a yawning cavern casts a dreadful shade
nor the fleet arrow from the twanging bow
sent with full force could reach the depth below
wide to the west the horrid gulf extends
and the dire passage down to hell descends
o fly the dreadful sight expand thy sails
ply the strong oar and catch the nimble gales
here scylla bellows from the dire abodes
tremendous pest abhorrd by man and gods
hideous her voice and with less terrors roar
the whelps of lions in the midnight hour
twelve feet deformd and foul the fiend dispreads
six horrid necks she rears and six terrific heads
her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth
jaggy they stand the gaping den of death
her parts obscene the raging billows hide
her bosom terribly oerlooks the tide
when stung with hunger she embroils the flood
the seadog and the dolphin are her food
she makes the huge leviathan her prey
and all the monsters of the watery way
the swiftest racer of the azure plain
here fills her sails and spreads her oars in vain
fell scylla rises in her fury roars
at once six mouths expands at once six men devours

close by a rock of less enormous height
breaks the wild waves and forms a dangerous strait
full on its crown a figs green branches rise
and shoot a leafy forest to the skies
beneath charybdis holds her boisterous reign
midst roaring whirlpools and absorbs the main
thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside
thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide
oh if thy vessel plough the direful waves
when seas retreating roar within her caves
ye perish all though he who rules the main
lends his strong aid his aid he lends in vain
ah shun the horrid gulf by scylla fly
tis better six to lose than all to die

i then o nymph propitious to my prayer
goddess divine my guardian power declare
is the foul fiend from human vengeance freed
or if i rise in arms can scylla bleed

then she o worn by toils o broke in fight
still are new toils and war thy dire delight
will martial flames for ever fire thy mind
and never never be to heaven resignd
how vain thy efforts to avenge the wrong
deathless the pest impenetrably strong
furious and fell tremendous to behold
een with a look she withers all the bold
she mocks the weak attempts of human might
oh fly her rage thy conquest is thy flight
if but to seize thy arms thou make delay
again thy fury vindicates her prey
her six mouths yawn and six are snatchd away
from her foul wound crataeis gave to air
this dreadful pest to her direct thy prayer
to curb the monster in her dire abodes
and guard thee through the tumult of the floods
thence to trinacrias shore you bend your way
where graze thy herds illustrious source of day
seven herds seven flocks enrich the sacred plains
each herd each flock full fifty heads contains
the wondrous kind a length of age survey
by breed increase not nor by death decay
two sister goddesses possess the plain
the constant guardian of the woolly train
lampetie fair and phaethusa young
from phœbus and the bright neæra sprung
here watchful oer the flocks in shady bowers
and flowery meads they waste the joyous hours
rob not the gods and so propitious gales
attend thy voyage and impel thy sails
but if thy impious hands the flocks destroy
the gods the gods avenge it and ye die
tis thine alone 
through tedious toils to view thy native coast

she ceased and now arose the morning ray
swift to her dome the goddess held her way
then to my mates i measured back the plain
climbd the tall bark and rushd into the main
then bending to the stroke their oars they drew
to their broad breasts and swift the galley flew
up sprung a brisker breeze with freshening gales
the friendly goddess stretchd the swelling sails
we drop our oars at ease the pilot guides
the vessel light along the level glides
when rising sad and slow with pensive look
thus to the melancholy train i spoke

o friends oh ever partners of my woes
attend while i what heaven foredooms disclose
hear all fate hangs oer all on you it lies
to live or perish to be safe be wise

in flowery meads the sportive sirens play
touch the soft lyre and tune the vocal lay
me me alone with fetters firmly bound
the gods allow to hear the dangerous sound
hear and obey if freedom i demand
be every fetter straind be added band to band

while yet i speak the winged galley flies
and lo the siren shores like mists arise
sunk were at once the winds the air above
and waves below at once forgot to move
some demon calmd the air and smoothd the deep
hushd the loud winds and charmd the waves to sleep
now every sail we furl each oar we ply
lashd by the stroke the frothy waters fly
the ductile wax with busy hands i mould
and cleft in fragments and the fragments rolld
the aërial region now grew warm with day
the wax dissolved beneath the burning ray
then every ear i barrd against the strain
and from access of frenzy lockd the brain
now round the masts my mates the fetters rolld
and bound me limb by limb with fold on fold
then bending to the stroke the active train
plunge all at once their oars and cleave the main

while to the shore the rapid vessel flies
our swift approach the siren choir descries
celestial music warbles from their tongue
and thus the sweet deluders tune the song

oh stay o pride of greece ulysses stay
oh cease thy course and listen to our lay
blest is the man ordaind our voice to hear
the song instructs the soul and charms the ear
approach thy soul shall into raptures rise
approach and learn new wisdom from the wise
we know whateer the kings of mighty name
achieved at ilion in the field of fame
whateer beneath the suns bright journey lies
oh stay and learn new wisdom from the wise

thus the sweet charmers warbled oer the main
my soul takes wing to meet the heavenly strain
i give the sign and struggle to be free
swift row my mates and shoot along the sea
new chains they add and rapid urge the way
till dying off the distant sounds decay
then scudding swiftly from the dangerous ground
the deafend ear unlockd the chains unbound

now all at once tremendous scenes unfold
thunderd the deeps the smoky billows rolld
tumultuous waves embroil the bellowing flood
all trembling deafend and aghast we stood
no more the vessel ploughd the dreadful wave
fear seized the mighty and unnerved the brave
each droppd his oar but swift from man to man
with looks serene i turnd and thus began
o friends o often tried in adverse storms
with ills familiar in more dreadful forms
deep in the dire cyclopean den you lay
yet safe returndulysses led the way
learn courage hence and in my care confide
lo still the same ulysses is your guide
attend my words your oars incessant ply
strain every nerve and bid the vessel fly
if from yon jostling rocks and wavy war
jove safety grants he grants it to your care
and thou whose guiding hand directs our way
pilot attentive listen and obey
bear wide thy course nor plough those angry waves
where rolls yon smoke yon tumbling ocean raves
steer by the higher rock lest whirld around
we sink beneath the circling eddy drownd
while yet i speak at once their oars they seize
stretch to the stroke and brush the working seas
cautious the name of scylla i suppressd
that dreadful sound had chilld the boldest breast

meantime forgetful of the voice divine
all dreadful bright my limbs in armour shine
high on the deck i take my dangerous stand
two glittering javelins lighten in my hand
prepared to whirl the whizzing spear i stay
till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey
around the dungeon studious to behold
the hideous pest my labouring eyes i rolld
in vain the dismal dungeon dark as night
veils the dire monster and confounds the sight

now through the rocks appalld with deep dismay
we bend our course and stem the desperate way
dire scylla there a scene of horror forms
and here charybdis fills the deep with storms
when the tide rushes from her rumbling caves
the rough rock roars tumultuous boil the waves
they toss they foam a wild confusion raise
like waters bubbling oer the fiery blaze
eternal mists obscure the aërial plain
and high above the rock she spouts the main
when in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides
she drains the ocean with the refluent tides
the rock rebellows with a thundering sound
deep wondrous deep below appears the ground

struck with despair with trembling hearts we viewd
the yawning dungeon and the tumbling flood
when lo fierce scylla stoopd to seize her prey
stretchd her dire jaws and swept six men away
chiefs of renown loudechoing shrieks arise
i turn and view them quivering in the skies
they call and aid with outstretchd arms implore
in vain they call those arms are stretchd no more
as from some rock that overhangs the flood
the silent fisher casts the insidious food
with fraudful care he waits the finny prize
and sudden lifts it quivering to the skies
so the foul monster lifts her prey on high
so pant the wretches struggling in the sky
in the wide dungeon she devours her food
and the flesh trembles while she churns the blood
worn as i am with griefs with care decayd
never i never scene so dire surveyd
my shivering blood congeald forgot to flow
aghast i stood a monument of woe

now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies
and the hoarse din like distant thunder dies
to sols bright isle our voyage we pursue
and now the glittering mountains rise to view
there sacred to the radiant god of day
graze the fair herds the flocks promiscuous stray
then suddenly was heard along the main
to low the ox to bleat the woolly train
straight to my anxious thoughts the sound conveyd
the words of circe and the theban shade
warnd by their awful voice these shores to shun
with cautious fears oppressd i thus begun

o friends o ever exercised in care
hear heavens commands and reverence what ye hear
to fly these shores the prescient theban shade
and circe warn oh be their voice obeyd
some mighty woe relentless heaven forebodes
fly these dire regions and revere the gods

while yet i spoke a sudden sorrow ran
through every breast and spread from man to man
till wrathful thus eurylochus began

o cruel thou some fury sure has steeld
that stubborn soul by toil untaught to yield
from sleep debarrd we sink from woes to woes
and cruel enviest thou a short repose
still must we restless rove new seas explore
the sun descending and so near the shore
and lo the night begins her gloomy reign
and doubles all the terrors of the main
oft in the dead of night loud winds arise
lash the wild surge and bluster in the skies
oh should the fierce southwest his rage display
and toss with rising storms the watery way
though gods descend from heavens aërial plain
to lend us aid the gods descend in vain
then while the night displays her awful shade
sweet time of slumber be the night obeyd
haste ye to land and when the morning ray
sheds her bright beam pursue the destined way
a sudden joy in every bosom rose
so willd some demon minister of woes

to whom with grief o swift to be undone
constraind i act what wisdom bids me shun
but yonder herbs and yonder flocks forbear
attest the heavens and call the gods to hear
content an innocent repast display
by circe given and fly the dangerous prey

thus i and while to shore the vessel flies
with hands uplifted they attest the skies
then where a fountains gurgling waters play
they rush to land and end in feasts the day
they feed they quaff and now 
sigh for their friends devourd and mourn the dead
nor cease the tears till each in slumber shares
a sweet forgetfulness of human cares
now far the night advanced her gloomy reign
and setting stars rolld down the azure plain
when at the voice of jove wild whirlwinds rise
and clouds and double darkness veil the skies
the moon the stars the bright ethereal host
seem as extinct and all their splendours lost
the furious tempest roars with dreadful sound
air thunders rolls the ocean groans the ground
all night it raged when morning rose to land
we hauld our bark and moord it on the strand
where in a beauteous grottos cool recess
dance the green nereids of the neighbouring seas

there while the wild winds whistled oer the main
thus careful i addressd the listening train

o friends be wise nor dare the flocks destroy
of these fair pastures if ye touch ye die
warnd by the high command of heaven be awed
holy the flocks and dreadful is the god
that god who spreads the radiant beams of light
and views wide earth and heavens unmeasured height

and now the moon had run her monthly round
the southeast blustering with a dreadful sound
unhurt the beeves untouchd the woolly train
low through the grove or touch the flowery plain
then faild our food then fish we make our prey
or fowl that screaming haunt the watery way
till now from sea or flood no succour found
famine and meagre want besieged us round
pensive and pale from grove to grove i strayd
from the loud storms to find a sylvan shade
there oer my hands the living wave i pour
and heaven and heavens immortal thrones implore
to calm the roarings of the stormy main
and guide me peaceful to my realms again
then oer my eyes the gods soft slumbers shed
while thus eurylochus arising said

o friends a thousand ways frail mortals lead
to the cold tomb and dreadful all to tread
but dreadful most when by a slow decay
pale hunger wastes the manly strength away
why cease ye then to implore the powers above
and offer hecatombs to thundering jove
why seize ye not yon beeves and fleecy prey
arise unanimous arise and slay
and if the gods ordain a safe return
to phœbus shrines shall rise and altars burn
but should the powers that oer mankind preside
decree to plunge us in the whelming tide
better to rush at once to shades below
than linger life away and nourish woe

thus he the beeves around securely stray
when swift to ruin they invade the prey
they seize they killbut for the rite divine
the barley faild and for libations wine
swift from the oak they strip the shady pride
and verdant leaves the flowery cake supplied

with prayer they now address the ethereal train
slay the selected beeves and flay the slain
the thighs with fat involved divide with art
strewd oer with morsels cut from every part
water instead of wine is brought in urns
and pourd profanely as the victim burns
the thighs thus offerd and the entrails dressd
they roast the fragments and prepare the feast

twas then soft slumber fled my troubled brain
back to the bark i speed along the main
when lo an odour from the feast exhales
spreads oer the coast and scents the tainted gales
a chilly fear congeald my vital blood
and thus obtesting heaven i mournd aloud

o sire of men and gods immortal jove
o all ye blissful powers that reign above
why were my cares beguiled in short repose
o fatal slumber paid with lasting woes
a deed so dreadful all the gods alarms
vengeance is on the wing and heaven in arms

meantime lampetie mounts the aërial way
and kindles into rage the god of day

vengeance ye powers  and then whose hand
aims the red bolt and hurls the writhen brand
slain are those herds which i with pride survey
when through the ports of heaven i pour the day
or deep in ocean plunge the burning ray
vengeance ye gods or i the skies forego
and bear the lamp of heaven to shades below

to whom the thundering power o source of day
whose radiant lamp adorns the azure way
still may thy beams through heavens bright portal rise
the joy of earth the glory of the skies
lo my red arm i bare my thunders guide
to dash the offenders in the whelming tide

to fair calypso from the bright abodes
hermes conveyd these counsels of the gods

meantime from man to man my tongue exclaims
my wrath is kindled and my soul in flames
in vain i view performd the direful deed
beeves slain in heaps along the ocean bleed

now heaven gave signs of wrath along the ground
crept the raw hides and with a bellowing sound
roard the dead limbs the burning entrails groand
six guilty days my wretched mates employ
in impious feasting and unhallowed joy
the seventh arose and now the sire of gods
reind the rough storms and calmd the tossing floods
with speed the bark we climb the spacious sails
loosed from the yards invite the impelling gales
past sight of shore along the surge we bound
and all above is sky and ocean all around
when lo a murky cloud the thunderer forms
full oer our heads and blackens heaven with storms
night dwells oer all the deep and now outflies
the gloomy west and whistles in the skies
the mountainbillows roar the furious blast
howls oer the shroud and rends it from the mast
the mast gives way and crackling as it bends
tears up the deck then all at once descends
the pilot by the tumbling ruin slain
dashd from the helm falls headlong in the main
then jove in anger bids his thunders roll
and forky lightnings flash from pole to pole
fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims
red with uncommon wrath and wrappd in flames
full on the bark it fell now high now low
tossd and retossd it reeld beneath the blow
at once into the main the crew it shook
sulphurous odours rose and smouldering smoke
like fowl that haunt the floods they sink they rise
now lost now seen with shrieks and dreadful cries
and strive to gain the bark but jove denies
firm at the helm i stand when fierce the main
rushd with dire noise and dashd the sides in twain
again impetuous drove the furious blast
snappd the strong helm and bore to sea the mast
firm to the mast with cords the helm i bind
and ride aloft to providence resignd
through tumbling billows and a war of wind
now sunk the west and now a southern breeze
more dreadful than the tempest lashd the seas
for on the rocks it bore where scylla raves
and dire charybdis rolls her thundering waves
all night i drove and at the dawn of day
fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way
just when the sea within her gulfs subsides
and in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides
swift from the float i vaulted with a bound
the lofty figtree seized and clung around
so to the beam the bat tenacious clings
and pendent round it clasps his leather wings
high in the air the tree its boughs displayd
and oer the dungeon cast a dreadful shade
all unsustaind between the wave and sky
beneath my feet the whirling billows fly
what time the judge forsakes the noisy bar
to take repast and stills the wordy war
charybdis rumbling from her inmost caves
the mast refunded on her refluent waves
swift from the tree the floating mass to gain
sudden i droppd amidst the flashing main
once more undaunted on the ruin rode
and oard with labouring arms along the flood
unseen i passd by scyllas dire abodes
so jove decreed 
then nine long days i plowd the calmer seas
heaved by the surge and wafted by the breeze
weary and wet the ogygian shores i gain
when the tenth sun descended to the main
there in calypsos everfragrant bowers
refreshd i lay and joy beguiled the hours
my following fates to thee o king are known
and the bright partner of thy royal throne
enough in misery can words avail
and what so tedious as a twicetold tale







he ceased but left so pleasing on their ear
his voice that listening still they seemd to hear
a pause of silence hushd the shady rooms
the grateful conference then the king resumes

whatever toils the great ulysses passd
beneath this happy roof they end at last
no longer now from shore to shore to roam
smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home
but hear me princes whom these walls inclose
for whom my chanter sings and goblet flows
with wine unmixd 
though labourd gold and many a dazzling vest
lie heapd already for our godlike guest
without new treasures let him not remove
large and expressive of the public love
each peer a tripod each a vase bestow
a general tribute which the state shall owe

this sentence pleased then all their steps addressd
to separate mansions and retired to rest

now did the rosyfingerd morn arise
and shed her sacred light along the skies
down to the haven and the ships in haste
they bore the treasures and in safety placed
the king himself the vases ranged with care
then bade his followers to the feast prepare
a victim ox beneath the sacred hand
of great alcinous falls and stains the sand
to jove the eternal 
the flames ascend till evening they prolong
the rites more sacred made by heavenly song
for in the midst with public honours graced
thy lyre divine demodocus was placed
all but ulysses heard with fixd delight
he sate and eyed the sun and wishd the night
slow seemd the sun to move the hours to roll
his native home deepimaged in his soul
as the tired ploughman spent with stubborn toil
whose oxen long have torn the furrowd soil
sees with delight the suns declining ray
when home with feeble knees he bends his way
to late repast 
so to ulysses welcome set the sun
then instant to alcinous and the rest
 he turnd and thus addressd

o thou the first in merit and command
and you the peers and princes of the land
may every joy be yours nor this the least
when due libation shall have crownd the feast
safe to my home to send your happy guest
complete are now the bounties you have given
be all those bounties but confirmd by heaven
so may i find when all my wanderings cease
my consort blameless and my friends in peace
on you be every bliss and every day
in homefelt joys delighted roll away
yourselves your wives your longdescending race
may every god enrich with every grace
sure fixd on virtue may your nation stand
and public evil never touch the land

his words well weighd the general voice approved
benign and instant his dismission moved
the monarch to pontonus gave the sign
to fill the goblet high with rosy wine
great jove the father first  implore
then send the stranger to his native shore

the luscious wine the obedient herald brought
around the mansion flowd the purple draught
each from his seat to each immortal pours
whom glory circles in the olympian bowers
ulysses sole with air majestic stands
the bowl presenting to aretes hands
then thus o queen farewell be still possessd
of dear remembrance blessing still and blessd
till age and death shall gently call thee hence

farewell and joys successive ever spring
to thee to thine the people and the king

thus he then parting prints the sandy shore
to the fair port a herald marchd before
sent by alcinous of aretes train
three chosen maids attend him to the main
this does a tunic and white vest convey
a various casket that of rich inlay
and bread and wine the third the cheerful mates
safe in the hollow poop dispose the cates
upon the deck soft painted robes they spread
with linen coverd for the heros bed
he climbed the lofty stern then gently pressd
the swelling couch and lay composed to rest

now placed in order the phæacian train
their cables loose and launch into the main
at once they bend and strike their equal oars
and leave the sinking hills and lessening shores
while on the deck the chief in silence lies
and pleasing slumbers steal upon his eyes
as fiery coursers in the rapid race
urged by fierce drivers through the dusty space
toss their high heads and scour along the plain
so mounts the bounding vessel oer the main
back to the stern the parted billows flow
and the black ocean foams and roars below

thus with spread sails the winged galley flies
less swift an eagle cuts the liquid skies
divine ulysses was her sacred load
a man in wisdom equal to a god
much danger long and mighty toils he bore
in storms by sea and combats on the shore
all which soft sleep now banishd from his breast
wrappd in a pleasing deep and deathlike rest

but when the morningstar with early ray
flamed in the front of heaven and promised day
like distant clouds the mariner descries
fair ithacas emerging hills arise
far from the town a spacious port appears
sacred to phorcys power whose name it bears
two craggy rocks projecting to the main
the roaring winds tempestuous rage restrain
within the waves in softer murmurs glide
and ships secure without their halsers ride
high at the head a branching olive grows
and crowns the pointed cliffs with shady boughs
beneath a gloomy grottos cool recess
delights the nereids of the neighbouring seas
where bowls and urns were formd of living stone
and massy beams in native marble shone
on which the labours of the nymphs were rolld
their webs divine of purple mixd with gold
within the cave the clustering bees attend
their waxen works or from the roof depend
perpetual waters oer the pavement glide
two marble doors unfold on either side
sacred the south by which the gods descend
but mortals enter at the northern end

thither they bent and hauld their ship to land

ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore
and gently placed him on the rocky shore
his treasures next alcinous gifts they laid
in the wild olives unfrequented shade
secure from theft then launchd the bark again
resumed their oars and measured back the main
nor yet forgot old oceans dread supreme
the vengeance vowd for eyeless polypheme
before the throne of mighty jove he stood
and sought the secret counsels of the god

shall then no more o sire of gods be mine
the rights and honours of a power divine
scornd een by man and 
by soft phæacians my degenerate race
against yon destined head in vain i swore
and menaced vengeance ere he reachd his shore
to reach his natal shore was thy decree
mild i obeyd for who shall war with thee
behold him landed careless and asleep
from all the eluded dangers of the deep
lo where he lies amidst a shining store
of brass rich garments and refulgent ore
and bears triumphant to his native isle
a prize more worth than ilions noble spoil

to whom the father of the immortal powers
who swells the clouds and gladdens earth with showers
can mighty neptune thus of man complain
neptune tremendous oer the boundless main
revered and awful een in heavens abodes
ancient and great a god above the gods
if that low race offend thy power divine
 is not vengeance thine
go then the guilty at thy will chastise
he said the shaker of the earth replies

this then i doom to fix the gallant ship
a mark of vengeance on the sable deep
to warn the thoughtless selfconfiding train
no more unlicensed thus to brave the main
full in their port a shady hill shall rise
if such thy willwe will it 
een when with transport blackening all the strand
the swarming people hail their ship to land
fix her for ever a memorial stone
still let her seem to sail and seem alone
the trembling crowds shall see the sudden shade
of whelming mountains overhang their head

with that the god whose earthquakes rock the ground
fierce to phæacia crossd the vast profound
swift as a swallow sweeps the liquid way
the winged pinnace shot along the sea
the god arrests her with a sudden stroke
and roots her down an everlasting rock
aghast the scherians stand in deep surprise
all press to speak all question with their eyes
what hands unseen the rapid bark restrain
and yet it swims or seems to swim the main
thus they unconscious of the deed divine
till great alcinous rising ownd the sign

behold the long predestined day 
o certain faith of ancient prophecies
these ears have heard my royal sire disclose
a dreadful story big with future woes
how moved with wrath that careless we convey
promiscuous every guest to every bay
stern neptune raged and how by his command
firm rooted in the surge a ship should stand
 and mound on mound
should hide our walls or whelm beneath the ground

the fates have followd as declared the seer
be humbled nations and your monarch hear
no more unlicensed brave the deeps no more
with every stranger pass from shore to shore
on angry neptune now for mercy call
to his high name let twelve black oxen fall
so may the god reverse his purposed will
nor oer our city hang the dreadful hill

the monarch spoke they trembled and obeyd
forth on the sands the victim oxen led
the gathered tribes before the altars stand
and chiefs and rulers a majestic band
the king of ocean all the tribes implore
the blazing altars redden all the shore

meanwhile ulysses in his country lay
released from sleep and round him might survey
the solitary shore and rolling sea
yet had his mind through tedious absence lost
the dear resemblance of his native coast
besides minerva to secure her care
diffused around a veil of thickened air
for so the gods ordaind to keep unseen
his royal person from his friends and queen
till the proud suitors for their crimes afford
an ample vengeance to their injured lord

now all the land another prospect bore
another port appeard another shore
and longcontinued ways and winding floods
and unknown mountains crownd with unknown woods
pensive and slow with sudden grief oppressd
the king arose and beat his careful breast
cast a long look oer all the coast and main
and sought around his native realm in vain
then with erected eyes stood fixd in woe
and as he spoke the tears began to flow

ye gods  upon what barren coast
in what new region is ulysses tossd
possessd by wild barbarians fierce in arms
or men whose bosom tender pity warms
where shall this treasure now in safely lie
and whither whither its sad owner fly
ah why did i alcinous grace implore
ah why forsake phæacias happy shore
some juster prince perhaps had entertaind
and safe restored me to my native land
is this the promised longexpected coast
and this the faith phæacias rulers boast
o righteous gods of all the great how few
are just to heaven and to their promise true
but he the power to whose allseeing eyes
the deeds of men appear without disguise
tis his alone to avenge the wrongs i bear
for still the oppressd are his peculiar care
to count these presents and from thence to prove
their faith is mine the rest belongs to jove

then on the sands he ranged his wealthy store
the gold the vests the tripods numberd oer
all these he found but still in error lost
disconsolate he wanders on the coast
sighs for his country and laments again
to the deaf rocks and hoarseresounding main
when lo the guardian goddess of the wise
celestial pallas stood before his eyes
in show a youthful swain of form divine
who seemd descended from some princely line
a graceful robe her slender body dressd
around her shoulders flew the waving vest
her decent hand a shining javelin bore
and painted sandals on her feet she wore
to whom the king whoeer of human race
thou art that wanderest in this desert place
with joy to thee as to some god i bend
to thee my treasures and myself commend
o tell a wretch in exile doomd to stray
what air i breathe what country i survey
the fruitful continents extremest bound
or some fair isle which neptunes arms surround

from what far clime  remote from fame
arrivest thou here a stranger to our name
thou seest an island not to those unknown
whose hills are brightend by the rising sun
nor those that placed beneath his utmost reign
behold him sinking in the western main
the rugged soil allows no level space
for flying chariots or the rapid race
yet not ungrateful to the peasants pain
suffices fulness to the swelling grain
the loaded trees their various fruits produce
and clustering grapes afford a generous juice
woods crown our mountains and in every grove
the bounding goats and frisking heifers rove
soft rains and kindly dews refresh the field
and rising springs eternal verdure yield
een to those shores is ithaca renownd
where troys majestic ruins strew the ground

at this the chief with transport was possessd
his panting heart exulted in his breast
yet well dissembling his untimely joys
and veiling truth in plausible disguise
thus with an air sincere in fiction bold
his ready tale the inventive hero told

oft have i heard in crete this islands name
for twas from crete my native soil i came
selfbanished thence i saild before the wind
and left my children and my friends behind
from fierce idomeneus revenge i flew
whose son the swift orsilochus i slew

unseen i scaped and favourd by the night
in a phoenician vessel took my flight
for pyle or elis bound but tempests tossd
and raging billows drove us on your coast
in dead of night an unknown port we gaind
spent with fatigue and slept secure on land
but ere the rosy morn renewd the day
while in the embrace of pleasing sleep i lay
sudden invited by auspicious gales
they land my goods and hoist their flying sails
abandond here my fortune i deplore
a hapless exile on a foreign shore

thus while he spoke the blueeyed maid began
with pleasing smiles to view the godlike man
then changed her form and now divinely bright
joves heavenly daughter stood confessd to sight
like a fair virgin in her beautys bloom
skilld in the illustrious labours of the loom

o still the same ulysses 
in useful craft successfully refined
artful in speech in action and in mind
sufficed it not that thy long labours passd
secure thou seest thy native shore at last
but this to me who like thyself excel
in arts of counsel and dissembling well
to me whose wit exceeds the powers divine
no less than mortals are surpassd by thine
knowst thou not me who made thy life my care
through ten years wandering and through ten years war
who taught thee arts alcinous to persuade
to raise his wonder and engage his aid
and now appear thy treasures to protect
conceal thy person thy designs direct
and tell what more thou must from fate expect
domestic woes far heavier to be borne
the pride of fools and slaves insulting scorn
but thou be silent nor reveal thy state
yield to the force of unresisted fate
and bear unmoved the wrongs of base mankind
the last and hardest conquest of the mind

goddess of wisdom 
he who discerns thee must be truly wise
so seldom viewd and ever in disguise
when the bold argives led their warring powers
against proud ilions welldefended towers
ulysses was thy care celestial maid
graced with thy sight and favoured with thy aid
but when the trojan piles in ashes lay
and bound for greece we ploughd the watery way
our fleet dispersed and driven from coast to coast
thy sacred presence from that hour i lost
till i beheld thy radiant form once more
and heard thy counsels on phæacias shore
but by the almighty author of thy race
tell me oh tell is this my native place
for much i fear long tracts of land and sea
divide this coast from distant ithaca
the sweet delusion kindly you impose
to soothe my hopes and mitigate my woes

thus he the blueeyed goddess thus replies
how prone to doubt how cautious are the wise
who versed in fortune fear the flattering show
and taste not half the bliss the gods bestow
the more shall pallas aid thy just desires
and guard the wisdom which herself inspires
others long absent from their native place
straight seek their home and fly with eager pace
to their wives arms and childrens dear embrace
not thus ulysses he decrees to prove
his subjects faith and queens suspected love
who mournd her lord twice ten revolving years
and wastes the days in grief the nights in tears
but pallas knew 
once more twas given thee to behold thy coast
yet how could i with adverse fate engage
and mighty neptunes unrelenting rage
now lift thy longing eyes while i restore
the pleasing prospect of thy native shore
bebold the port of phorcys fenced around
with rocky mountains and with olives crownd
behold the gloomy grot whose cool recess
delights the nereids of the neighbouring seas
whose nowneglected altars in thy reign
blushd with the blood of sheep and oxen slain
behold where neritus the clouds divides
and shakes the waving forests on his sides

so spake the goddess and the prospect cleard
the mists dispersed and all the coast appeared
the king with joy confessd his place of birth
and on his knees salutes his mother earth
then with his suppliant hands upheld in air
thus to the seagreen sisters sends his prayer

all hail ye virgin daughters of the main
ye streams beyond my hopes beheld again
to you once more your own ulysses bows
attend his transports and receive his vows
if jove prolong my days and pallas crown
the growing virtues of my youthful son
to you shall rites divine be ever paid
and grateful offerings on your altars laid

thus then minerva from that anxious breast
dismiss those cares and leave to heaven the rest
our task be now thy treasured stores to save
deep in the close recesses of the cave
then future means consult she spoke and trod
the shady grot that brightend with the god
the closest caverns of the grot she sought
the gold the brass the robes ulysses brought
these in the secret gloom the chief disposed
the entrance with a rock the goddess closed

now seated in the olives sacred shade
confer the hero and the martial maid
the goddess of the azure eyes began
son of laertes muchexperienced man
the suitortrain thy earliest care demand
of that luxurious race to rid the land
three years thy house their lawless rule has seen
and proud addresses to the matchless queen
but she thy absence mourns from day to day
and inly bleeds and silent wastes away
elusive of the bridal hour she gives
fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives

to this ulysses o celestial maid
praised be thy counsel and thy timely aid
else had i seen my native walls in vain
like great atrides just restored and slain
vouchsafe the means of vengeance to debate
and plan with all thy arts the scene of fate
then then be present and my soul inspire
as when we wrappd troys heavenbuilt walls in fire
though leagued against me hundred heroes stand
hundreds shall fall if pallas aid my hand

she answerd in the dreadful day of fight
know i am with thee strong in all my might
if thou but equal to thyself be found
what gasping numbers then shall press the ground
what human victims stain the feastful floor
how wide the pavements float with guilty gore
it fits thee now to wear a dark disguise
and secret walk unknown to mortal eyes
for this my hand shall wither every grace
and every elegance of form and face
oer thy smooth skin a bark of wrinkles spread
turn hoar the auburn honours of thy head
disfigure every limb with coarse attire
and in thy eyes extinguish all the fire
add all the wants and the decays of life
estrange thee from thy own thy son thy wife
from the loathed object every sight shall turn
and the blind suitors their destruction scorn

go first the master of thy herds to find
true to his charge a loyal swain and kind
for thee he sighs and to the loyal heir
and chaste penelope extends his care
at the coracian rock he now resides
where arethusas sable water glides
the sable water and the copious mast
swell the fat herd luxuriant large repast
with him rest peaceful in the rural cell
and all you ask his faithful tongue shall tell
me into other realms my cares convey
to sparta still with female beauty gay
for know to sparta thy loved offspring came
to learn thy fortunes from the voice of fame

at this the father with a fathers care
must he too suffer he o goddess bear
of wanderings and of woes a wretched share
through the wild ocean plough the dangerous way
and leave his fortunes and his house a prey
why wouldst not thou o allenlightend mind
inform him certain and protect him kind

to whom minerva be thy soul at rest
and know whatever heaven ordains is best
to fame i sent him to acquire renown
to other regions is his virtue known
secure he sits near great atrides placed
with friendships strengthend and with honours graced
but lo an ambush waits his passage oer
fierce foes insidious intercept the shore
in vain far sooner all the murderous brood
this injured land shall fatten with their blood

she spake then touchd him with her powerful wand
the skin shrunk up and witherd at her hand
a swift old age oer all his members spread
a sudden frost was sprinkled on his head
nor longer in the heavy eyeball shined
the glance divine forthbeaming from the mind
his robe which spots indelible besmear
in rags dishonest flutters with the air
a stags torn hide is lappd around his reins
a rugged staff his trembling hand sustains
and at his side a wretched scrip was hung
widepatchd and knotted to a twisted thong
so looked the chief so moved to mortal eyes
object uncouth a man of miseries
while pallas cleaving the wild fields of air
to sparta flies telemachus her care







but he deepmusing oer the mountains strayd
through mazy thickets of the woodland shade
and cavernd ways the shaggy coast along
with cliffs and nodding forests overhung
eumaeus at his sylvan lodge he sought
a faithful servant and without a fault
ulysses found him busied as he sate
before the threshold of his rustic gate
around the mansion in a circle shone
a rural portico of rugged stone

the wall was stone from neighbouring quarries borne
encircled with a fence of native thorn
and strong with pales by many a weary stroke
of stubborn labour hewn from heart of oak
frequent and thick within the space were reard
twelve ample cells the lodgments of his herd
full fifty pregnant females each containd
the males without  remaind
doomd to supply the suitors wasteful feast
a stock by daily luxury decreased
now scarce four hundred left these to defend
four savage dogs a watchful guard attend
here sat eumaeus and his cares applied
to form strong buskins of wellseasond hide
of four assistants who his labour share
three now were absent on the rural care
the fourth drove victims to a suitor train
but he of ancient faith a simple swain
sighd while he furnishd the luxurious board
and wearied heaven with wishes for his lord

soon as ulysses near the inclosure drew
with open mouths the furious mastiffs flew
down sat the sage and cautious to withstand
let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand
sudden the master runs aloud he calls
and from his hasty hand the leather falls
with showers of stones he drives then far away
the scattering dogs around at distance bay

unhappy stranger 
what sorrow had been mine if at my gate
thy reverend age had met a shameful fate
enough of woes already have i known
enough my masters sorrows and my own
while here  his herds i feed
ordaind for lawless rioters to bleed
perhaps supported at anothers board
far from his country roams my hapless lord
or sighd in exile forth his latest breath
now coverd with the eternal shade of death

but enter this my homely roof and see
our woods not void of hospitality
then tell me whence thou art and what the share
of woes and wanderings thou wert born to bear

he said and seconding the kind request
with friendly step precedes his unknown guest
a shaggy goats soft hide beneath him spread
and with fresh rushes heapd an ample bed
jove touchd the heros tender soul to find
so just reception from a heart so kind
and oh ye gods with all your blessings grace
 this friend of human race

the swain replied it never was our guise
to slight the poor or aught humane despise
for jove unfolds our hospitable door
tis jove that sends the stranger and the poor
little alas is all the good i can
a man oppressd dependent yet a man
accept such treatment as a swain affords
slave to the insolence of youthful lords
far hence is by unequal gods removed
that man of bounties loving and beloved
to whom whateer his slave enjoys is owed
and more had fate allowd had been bestowd
but fate condemnd him to a foreign shore
much have i sorrowd but my master more
now cold he lies to deaths embrace resignd
ah perish helen perish all her kind
for whose cursed cause in agamemnons name
he trod so fatally the paths of fame

his vest succinct then girding round his waist
forth rushd the swain with hospitable haste
straight to the lodgments of his herd he run
where the fat porkers slept beneath the sun
of two his cutlass launchd the spouting blood
these quarterd singed and fixd on forks of wood
all hasty on the hissing coals he threw
and smoking back the tasteful viands drew
broachers and all then an the board displayd
the ready meal before ulysses laid
with flour imbrownd next mingled wine yet new
and luscious as the bees nectareous dew
then sate companion of the friendly feast
with open look and thus bespoke his guest
take with free welcome what our hands prepare
such food as falls to simple servants share
the best our lords consume those thoughtless peers
rich without bounty guilty without fears
yet sure the gods their impious acts detest
and honour justice and the righteous breast
pirates and conquerors of hardend mind
the foes of peace and scourges of mankind
to whom offending men are made a prey
when jove in vengeance gives a land away
een these when of their illgot spoils possessd
find sure tormentors in the guilty breast
some voice of god close whispering from within
wretch this is villainy and this is sin
but these no doubt some oracle explore
that tells the great ulysses is no more
hence springs their confidence and from our sighs
their rapine strengthens and their riots rise
constant as jove the night and day bestows
bleeds a whole hecatomb a vintage flows
none matchd this heros wealth of all who reign
oer the fair islands of the neighbouring main
nor all the monarchs whose fardreaded sway
the wideextended continents obey
first on the main land of ulysses breed
twelve herds twelve flocks on oceans margin feed
as many stalls for shaggy goats are reard
as many lodgments for the tusky herd
two foreign keepers guard and here are seen
twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green
to native pastors is their charge assignd
and mine the care to feed the bristly kind
each day the fattest bleeds of either herd
all to the suitors wasteful board preferrd
thus he benevolent his unknown guest
with hunger keen devours the savoury feast
while schemes of vengeance ripen in his breast
silent and thoughtful while the board he eyed
eumaeus pours on high the purple tide
the king with smiling looks his joy expressd
and thus the kind inviting host addressd

say now what man is he the man deplored
so rich so potent whom you style your lord
late with such affluence and possessions blessd
and now in honours glorious bed at rest
whoever was the warrior he must be
to fame no stranger nor perhaps to me
who 
have wanderd many a sea and many a land

small is the faith the prince and queen ascribe
 to the wandering tribe
for needy strangers still to flattery fly
and want too oft betrays the tongue to lie
each vagrant traveller that touches here
deludes with fallacies the royal ear
to dear remembrance makes his image rise
and calls the springing sorrows from her eyes
such thou mayst be but he whose name you crave
moulders in earth or welters on the wave
or food for fish or dogs his relics lie
or torn by birds are scatterd through the sky
so perishd he and left 
much woe to all but sure to me the most
so mild a master never shall i find
less dear the parents whom i left behind
less soft my mother less my father kind
not with such transport would my eyes run oer
again to hail them in their native shore
as loved ulysses once more to embrace
restored and breathing in his natal place
that name for ever dread yet ever dear
een in his absence i pronounce with fear
in my respect he bears a princes part
but lives a very brother in my heart

thus spoke the faithful swain and thus rejoind
the master of his grief the man of patient mind
ulysses friend shall view his old abodes
 nor doubt the gods
nor speak i rashly but with faith averrd
and what i speak attesting heaven has heard
if so a cloak and vesture be my meed
till his return no title shall i plead
though certain be my news and great my need
whom want itself can force untruths to tell
my soul detests him as the gates of hell

thou first be witness hospitable jove
and every god inspiring social love
and witness every household power that waits
guard of these fires and angel of these gates
ere the next moon increase or this decay
his ancient realms ulysses shall survey
in blood and dust each proud oppressor mourn
and the lost glories of his house return

nor shall that meed be thine nor ever more
shall loved ulysses hail this happy shore
 to the present hour
now turn thy thought and joys within our power
from sad reflection let my soul repose
the name of him awakes a thousand woes
but guard him gods and to these arms restore
not his true consort can desire him more
not old laertes broken with despair
not young telemachus his blooming heir
alas telemachus my sorrows flow
afresh for thee my second cause of woe
like some fair plant set by a heavenly hand
he grew he flourishd and he blessd the land
in all the youth his fathers image shined
bright in his person brighter in his mind
what man or god deceived his better sense
far on the swelling seas to wander hence
to distant pylos hapless is he gone
to seek his fathers fate and find his own
for traitors wait his way with dire design
to end at once the great arcesian line
but let us leave him to their wills above
the fates of men are in the hand of jove
and now my venerable guest declare
your name your parents and your native air
sincere from whence begun your course relate
and to what ship i owe the friendly freight

thus he and thus 
the cautious chief his ready story told

on dark reserve what better can prevail
or from the fluent tongue produce the tale
than when two friends alone in peaceful place
confer and wines and cates the table grace
but most the kind inviters cheerful face
thus might we sit with social goblets crownd
till the whole circle of the year goes round
not the whole circle of the year would close
my long narration of a life of woes
but such was heavens high will know then i came
from sacred crete and from a sire of fame
castor hylacides 
beloved and honourd in his native shore
blessd in his riches in his children more
sprung of a handmaid from a bought embrace
i shared his kindness with his lawful race
but when that fate which all must undergo
from earth removed him to the shades below
the large domain his greedy sons divide
and each was portiond as the lots decide
little alas was left my wretched share
except a house a covert from the air
but what by niggard fortune was denied
a willing widows copious wealth supplied
my valour was my plea a gallant mind
that true to honour never laggd behind

now wasting years my former strength confound
and added woes have bowd me to the ground
yet by the stubble you may guess the grain
and mark the ruins of no vulgar man
me pallas gave to lead the martial storm
and the fair ranks of battle to deform
me mars inspired to turn the foe to flight
and tempt the secret ambush of the night
let ghastly death in all his forms appear
i saw him not it was not mine to fear
before the rest i raised my ready steel
the first i met he yielded or he fell
but works of peace my soul disdaind to bear
the rural labour or domestic care
to raise the mast the missile dart to wing
and send swift arrows from the bounding string
were arts the gods made grateful to my mind
those gods who turn 
the various thoughts and talents of mankind
before the grecians touchd the trojan plain
nine times commander or by land or main
in foreign fields i spread my glory far
great in the praise rich in the spoils of war
thence charged with riches as increased in fame
to crete returnd an honourable name
but when great jove that direful war decreed
which roused all greece and made the mighty bleed
our states myself and idomen employ
to lead their fleets and carry death to troy
nine years we warrd the tenth saw ilion fall
homeward we saild but heaven dispersed us all
one only month my wife enjoyd my stay
so willd the god who gives and takes away
nine ships i mannd equippd with ready stores
intent to voyage to the ægyptian shores
in feast and sacrifice my chosen train
six days consumd the seventh we ploughd the main
cretes ample fields diminish to our eye
before the boreal blast the vessels fly
safe through the level seas we sweep our way
the steersman governs and the ships obey
the fifth fair morn we stem the ægyptian tide
and tilting oer the bay the vessels ride
to anchor there my fellows i command
and spies commission to explore the land
but swayd by lust of gain and headlong will
the coasts they ravage and the natives kill
the spreading clamour to their city flies
and horse and foot in mingled tumult rise
the reddening dawn reveals the circling fields
horrid with bristly spears and glancing shields
jove thunderd on their side our guilty head
we turnd to flight the gathering vengeance spread
on all parts round and heaps on heaps lie dead
i then explored my thought what course to prove

oh had he left me to that happier doom
and saved a life of miseries to come
the radiant helmet from my brows unlaced
and low on earth my shield and javelin cast
i meet the monarch with a suppliants face
approach his chariot and his knees embrace
he heard he saved he placed me at his side
my state he pitied and my tears he dried
restraind the rage the vengeful foe expressd
and turnd the deadly weapons from my breast
pious to guard the hospitable rite
and fearing jove whom mercys works delight

in ægypt thus with peace and plenty blessd
i lived  a guest
on seven bright years successive blessings wait
the next changed all the colour of my fate
a false phoenician of insiduous mind
versed in vile arts and foe to humankind
with semblance fair invites me to his home
i seized the proffer 
domestic in his faithless roof i stayd
till the swift sun his annual circle made
to libya then he mediates the way
with guileful art a stranger to betray
and sell to bondage in a foreign land
much doubting yet compelld i quit the strand
through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails
aloof from crete before the northern gales
but when remote her chalky cliffs we lost
and far from ken of any other coast
when all was wild expanse of sea and air
then doomd high jove due vengeance to prepare
he hung a night of horrors oer their head

he launchd the fiery bolt from pole to pole
broad burst the lightnings deep the thunders roll
in giddy rounds the whirling ship is tossd
and all in clouds of smothering sulphur lost
as from a hanging rocks tremendous height
the sable crows with intercepted flight
drop endlong scarrd and black with sulphurous hue
so from the deck are hurld the ghastly crew
such end the wicked found but joves intent
was yet to save the oppressd and innocent
placed on the mast 
with winds and waves i held unequal strife
for nine long days the billows tilting oer
the tenth soft wafts me to thesprotias shore
the monarchs son a shipwreckd wretch relieved
the sire with hospitable rites received
and in his palace like a brother placed
with gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced
while here i sojournd oft i heard the fame
how late ulysses to the country came
how loved how honourd in this court he stayd
and here his whole collected treasure laid
i saw myself the vast unnumberd store
of steel elaborate and refulgent ore
and brass high heapd amidst the regal dome
immense supplies for ages yet to come
meantime he voyaged to explore the will
of jove on high dodonas holy hill
what means might best his safe return avail
to come in pomp or bear a secret sail
full oft has phidon whilst he pourd the wine
attesting solemn all the powers divine
that soon ulysses would return declared
the sailors waiting and the ships prepared
but first the king dismissd me from his shores
for fair dulichium crownd with fruitful stores
to good acastus friendly care consignd
but other counsels pleased the sailors mind
new frauds were plotted by the faithless train
and misery demands me once again
soon as remote from shore they plough the wave
with ready hands they rush to seize their slave
then with these tatterd rags they wrappd me round
 and to the vessel bound
at eve at ithacas delightful land
the ship arrivd forth issuing on the sand
they sought repast while to the unhappy kind
the pitying gods themselves my chains unbind
soft i descended to the sea applied
my naked breast and shot along the tide
soon passd beyond their sight i left the flood
and took the spreading shelter of the wood
their prize escaped the faithless pirates mournd
but deemd inquiry vain and to their ships returnd
screend by protecting gods from hostile eyes
they led me to a good man and a wise
to live beneath thy hospitable care
and wait the woes heaven dooms me yet to bear

unhappy guest whose sorrows touch my mind

for real sufferings since i grieve sincere
check not with fallacies the springing tear
nor turn the passion into groundless joy
for him whom heaven has destined to destroy
oh had he perishd on some wellfought day
or in his friends embraces died away
that grateful greece with streaming eyes might raise
historic marbles to record his praise
his praise eternal on the faithful stone
had with transmissive honours graced his son
now snatchd by harpies to the dreary coast
sunk is the hero and his glory lost
while pensive in this solitary den
far from gay cities and the ways of men
i linger life nor to the court repair
but when my constant queen commands my care
or when to taste her hospitable board
some guest arrives with rumours of her lord
and these indulge their want and those their woe
and here the tears and there the goblets flow
by many such have i been warnd but chief
by one aetolian robbd of all belief
whose hap it was to this our roof to roam
for murder banishd from his native home
he swore ulysses on the coast of crete
stayd but a season to refit his fleet
a few revolving months should waft him oer
fraught with bold warriors and a boundless store
o thou whom age has taught to understand
and heaven has guided with a favouring hand
on god or mortal to obtrude a lie
forbear and dread to flatter as to die
nor for such ends my house and heart are free
but dear respect to jove and charity

and why o swain of unbelieving mind

doubt you my oath yet more my faith to try
a solemn compact let us ratify
and witness every power that rules the sky
if here ulysses from his labours rest
be then my prize a tunic and a vest
and where my hopes invite me straight transport
in safety to dulichiums friendly court
but if he greets not thy desiring eye
hurl me from yon dread precipice on high
the due reward of fraud and perjury

doubtless o guest great laud and praise were mine

if after social rites and gifts bestowd
i staind my hospitable hearth with blood
how would the gods my righteous toils succeed
and bless the hand that made a stranger bleed
no morethe approaching hours of silent night
first claim refection then to rest invite
beneath our humble cottage let us haste
and here unenvied rural dainties taste

thus communed these while to their lowly dome
the fullfed swine returnd with evening home
compelld reluctant to their several sties
with din obstreperous and ungrateful cries
then to the slaves now from the herd the best
select in honour of our foreign guest
with him let us the genial banquet share
for great and many are the griefs we bear
while those who from our labours heap their board
blaspheme their feeder and forget their lord

thus speaking with despatchful hand he took
a weighty axe and cleft the solid oak
this on the earth he piled a boar full fed
of five years age before the pile was led
the swain whom acts of piety delight
observant of the gods begins the rite
first shears the forehead of the bristly boar
and suppliant stands invoking every power
to speed ulysses to his native shore
a knotty stake then aiming at his head
down dropped he groaning and the spirit fled
the scorching flames climb round on every side
then the singed members they with skill divide
on these in rolls of fat involved with art
the choicest morsels lay from every part
some in the flames bestrewd with flour they threw
some cut in fragments from the forks they drew
these while on several tables they dispose
a priest himself the blameless rustic rose
expert the destined victim to dispart
in seven just portions pure of hand and heart
one sacred to the nymphs apart they lay
another to the winged son of may
the rural tribe in common share the rest
the king the chine the honour of the feast
who sate delighted at his servants board
the faithful servant joyd his unknown lord
oh be thou dear  to jove
as well thou claimst a grateful strangers love

be then thy thanks 
enjoyment of the good the gods provide
from gods own hand descend our joys and woes
these he decrees and he but suffers those
all power is his and whatsoeer he wills
the will itself omnipotent fulfils
this said the firstfruits to the gods he gave
then pourd of offerd wine the sable wave
in great ulysses hand he placed the bowl
he sate and sweet refection cheerd his soul
the bread from canisters mesaulius gave

his task it was the wheaten loaves to lay
and from the banquet take the bowls away
and now the rage of hunger was repressd
and each betakes him to his couch to rest

now came the night and darkness coverd oer
the face of things the winds began to roar
the driving storm the watery westwind pours
and jove descends in deluges of showers
studious of rest and warmth ulysses lies
foreseeing from the first the storm would rise
in mere necessity of coat and cloak
with artful preface to his host he spoke
hear me my friends who this good banquet grace
tis sweet to play the fool in time and place
and wine can of their wits the wise beguile
make the sage frolic and the serious smile
the grave in merry measures frisk about
and many a longrepented word bring out
since to be talkative i now commence
let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense
once i was strong 
and with my betters claimd a share of praise
ulysses menelaus led forth a band
and joind me with them 
a deathful ambush for the foe to lay
beneath troy walls by night we took our way
there clad in arms along the marshes spread
we made the osierfringed bank our bed
full soon the inclemency of heaven i feel
nor had these shoulders covering but of steel
sharp blew the north snow whitening all the fields
froze with the blast and gathering glazed our shields
there all but i well fenced with cloak and vest
lay coverd by their ample shields at rest
fool that i was i left behind my own
the skill of weather and of winds unknown
and trusted to my coat and shield alone
when now was wasted more than half the night
and the stars faded at approaching light
sudden i joggd ulysses who was laid
fast by my side and shivering thus i said

here longer in this field i cannot lie
the winter pinches and with cold i die
and die ashamed 
the only fool who left his cloak behind

he thought and answerd hardly waking yet
sprung in his mind a momentary wit

hush thee 
speak not a word lest any greek may hear
and then 
hear me companions 
methinks too distant from the fleet we lie
een now a vision stood before my eye
and sure the warning vision was from high
let from among us some swift courier rise
haste to the general and demand supplies

up started thoas straight andraemons son
nimbly he rose and cast his garment down
instant the racer vanishd off the ground
that instant in his cloak i wrappd me round
and safe i slept till brightlydawning shone
the morn conspicuous on her golden throne

oh were my strength as then as then my age
some friend would fence me from the winters rage
yet tatterd as i look i challenged then
the honours and the offices of men
some master or some servant would allow
a cloak and vestbut i am nothing now

well hast thou spoke 
thy lips let fall no idle word or vain
nor garment shalt thou want nor aught beside
meet for the wandering suppliant to provide
but in the morning take thy clothes again
for here one vest suffices every swain
no change of garments to our hinds is known
but when returnd the good ulysses son
with better hand shall grace with fit attires
his guest and send thee where thy soul desires

the honest herdsman rose as this he said
and drew before the hearth the strangers bed
the fleecy spoils of sheep a goats rough hide
he spreads and adds a mantle thick and wide
with store to heap above him and below
and guard each quarter as the tempests blow
there lay the king and all the rest supine
all but the careful master of the swine
forth hasted he to tend his bristly care
well armd and fenced against nocturnal air
his weighty falchion oer his shoulder tied
his shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied
with his broad spear the dread of dogs and men
he seeks his lodging in the rocky den
there to the tusky herd he bends his way
where screend from boreas high oerarchd they lay







now had minerva reachd those ample plains
famed for the dance where menelaus reigns
anxious she flies to great ulysses heir
his instant voyage challenged all her care
beneath the royal portico displayd
with nestors son telemachus was laid
in sleep profound the son of nestor lies
not thine ulysses care unseald his eyes
restless he grieved with various fears oppressd
and all thy fortunes rolld within his breast
when o telemachus 
too long in vain too widely hast thou strayd
thus leaving careless thy paternal right
the robbers prize the prey to lawless might
on fond pursuits neglectful while you roam
een now the hand of rapine sacks the dome
hence to atrides and his leave implore
to launch thy vessel for thy natal shore
fly whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands
her kindreds wishes and her sires commands
through both eurymachus pursues the dame
and with the noblest gifts asserts his claim
hence therefore while thy stores thy own remain
thou knowst the practice of the female train
lost in the children of the present spouse
they slight the pledges of their former vows
their love is always with the lover past
still the succeeding flame expels the last
let oer thy house some chosen maid preside
till heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride
but now thy more attentive ears incline
observe the warnings of a power divine
for thee their snares the suitor lords shall lay
in samos sands or straits of ithaca
to seize thy life shall lurk the murderous band
ere yet thy footsteps press thy native land
nosooner far their riot and their lust
allcovering earth shall bury deep in dust
then distant from the scatterd islands steer
nor let the night retard thy full career
thy heavenly guardian shall instruct the gales
to smooth thy passage and supply thy sails
and when at ithaca thy labour ends
send to the town the vessel with thy friends
but seek thou first the master of the swine

there pass the night while he his course pursues
to bring penelope the wishdfor news
that thou safe sailing from the pylian strand
art come to bless her in thy native land
thus spoke the goddess and resumed her flight
to the pure regions of eternal light
meanwhile pisistratus he gently shakes
and with these words the slumbering youth awakes

rise son of nestor for the road prepare
and join the harnessd coursers to the car

what cause  can justify our flight
to tempt the dangers of forbidding night
here wait we rather till approaching day
shall prompt our speed and point the ready way
nor think of flight before the spartan king
shall bid farewell and bounteous presents bring
gifts which to distant ages safely stored
the sacred act of friendship shall record

thus he but when the dawn bestreakd the east
the king from helen rose and sought his guest
as soon as his approach the hero knew
the splendid mantle round him first he threw
then oer his ample shoulders whirld the cloak
respectful met the monarch and bespoke

hail great atrides favourd of high jove
let not thy friends in vain for licence move
swift let us measure back the watery way
nor check our speed impatient of delay

if with desire so strong thy bosom glows
ill  should i thy wish oppose
for oft in others freely i reprove
the illtimed efforts of officious love
who love too much hate in the like extreme
and both the golden mean alike condemn
alike he thwarts the hospitable end
who drives the free or stays the hasty friend
true friendships laws are by this rule expressd
welcome the coming speed the parting guest
yet stay my friends and in your chariot take
the noblest presents that our love can make
meantime commit we to our womens care
some choice domestic viands to prepare
the traveller rising from the banquet gay
eludes the labours of the tedious way
then if a wider course shall rather please
through spacious argos and the realms of greece
atrides in his chariot shall attend
himself thy convoy to each royal friend
no prince will let ulysses heir remove
without some pledge some monument of love
these will the caldron these the tripod give
from those the wellpaird mules we shall receive
or bowl embossd whose golden figures live

to whom the youth for prudence famed replied
o monarch care of heaven thy peoples pride
no friend in ithaca my place supplies
no powerful hands are there no watchful eyes
my stores exposed and fenceless house demand
the speediest succour from my guardian hand
lest in a search too anxious and too vain
of one lost joy i lose what yet remain

his purpose when the generous warrior heard
he charged the household cates to be prepared
now with the dawn from his adjoining home
was boethoedes eteoneus come
swift at the word he forms the rising blaze
and oer the coals the smoking fragments lays
meantime the king his son and helen went
where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent
the king selected from the glittering rows
a bowl the prince a silver beaker chose
the beauteous queen revolved with careful eyes
her various textures of unnumberd dyes
and chose the largest with no vulgar art
her own fair hands embroiderd every part
beneath the rest it lay divinely bright
like radiant hesper oer the gems of night
then with each gift they hastend to their guest
and thus the king ulysses heir addressd
since fixd are thy resolves may thundering jove
with happiest omens thy desires approve
this silver bowl whose costly margins shine
enchased with gold this valued gift be thine
to me this present of vulcanian frame
from sidons hospitable monarch came
to thee we now consign the precious load
the pride of kings and labour of a god

then gave the cup while megapenthe brought
the silver vase with living sculpture wrought
the beauteous queen advancing next displayd
the shining veil and thus endearing said

accept dear youth this monument of love
long since in better days by helen wove
safe in thy mothers care the vesture lay
to deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day
meantime mayst thou with happiest speed regain
thy stately palace and thy wide domain

she said and gave the veil with grateful look
the prince the variegated present took
and now when through the royal dome they passd
high on a throne the king each stranger placed
a golden ewer the attendant damsel brings
replete with water from the crystal springs
with copious streams the shining vase supplies
a silver layer of capacious size
they wash the tables in fair order spread
the glittering canisters are crownd with bread
viands of various kinds allure the taste
of choicest sort and savour rich repast
whilst eteoneus portions out the shares
atrides son the purple draught prepares
and now 
ulysses son with his illustrious friend
the horses join the polishd car ascend
along the court the fiery steeds rebound
and the wide portal echoes to the sound
the king precedes a bowl with fragrant wine

his right hand held before the steed he stands
then mixd with prayers he utters these commands

farewell and prosper youths let nestor know
what grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow
for all the proofs of his paternal care
through the long dangers of the ten years war
ah doubt not our report 
of all the virtues of thy generous mind
and oh returnd might we ulysses meet
to him thy presents show thy words repeat
how will each speech his grateful wonder raise
how will each gift indulge us in thy praise

scarce ended thus the prince when on the right
advanced the bird of jove auspicious sight
a milkwhite fowl his clinching talons bore
with care domestic pampered at the floor
peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue
in solemn speed the bird majestic flew
full dexter to the car the prosperous sight
filld every breast with wonder and delight

but nestors son the cheerful silence broke
and in these words the spartan chief bespoke
say if to us the gods these omens send
or fates peculiar to thyself portend

whilst yet the monarch paused with doubts oppressd
the beauteous queen relieved his labouring breast
hear me  to whom the gods have given
to read this sign and mystic sense of heaven
as thus the plumy sovereign of the air
left on the mountains brow his callow care
and wanderd through the wide ethereal way
to pour his wrath on yon luxurious prey
so shall thy godlike father tossd in vain
through all the dangers of the boundless main
arrive 
from slaughterd gluttons to release the dome

oh if this promised bliss by thundering jove
 stand fixd in fate above
to thee as to some god ill temples raise
and crown thy altars with the costly blaze

he said and bending oer his chariot flung
athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong
the bounding shafts upon the harness play
till night descending intercepts the way
to diocles at pherae they repair
whose boasted sire was sacred alpheus heir
with him all night the youthful stranger stayd
nor found the hospitable rites unpaid
but soon as morning from her orient bed
had tinged the mountains with her earliest red
they joind the steeds and on the chariot sprung
the brazen portals in their passage rung

to pylos soon they came when thus begun
to nestors heir ulysses godlike son

let not pisistratus in vain be pressd
nor unconsenting hear his friends request
his friend by long hereditary claim
in toils his equal and in years the same
no farther from our vessel i implore
the coursers drive but lash them to the shore
too long thy father would his friend detain
i dread his profferd kindness urged in vain

the hero paused and ponderd this request
while love and duty warrd within his breast
at length resolved he turnd his ready hand
and lashd his panting coursers to the strand
there while within the poop with care he stored
the regal presents of the spartan lord
with speed begone  call every mate
ere yet to nestor i the tale relate
tis true the fervour of his generous heart
brooks no repulse nor couldst thou soon depart
himself will seek thee here nor wilt thou find
in words alone the pylian monarch kind
but when arrived he thy return shall know
how will his breast with honest fury glow
this said the sounding strokes his horses fire
and soon he reached the palace of his sire

now  with speedy care
hoist every sail and every oar prepare
swift as the word his willing mates obey
and seize their seats impatient for the sea

meantime the prince with sacrifice adores
minerva and her guardian aid implores
when lo a wretch ran breathless to the shore
new from his crime and reeking yet with gore
a seer he was from great melampus sprung
melampus who in pylos flourishd long
till urged by wrongs a foreign realm he chose
far from the hateful cause of all his woes
neleus his treasures one long year detains
as long he groand in philacuss chains
meantime what anguish and what rage combined
for lovely pero rackd his labouring mind
yet scaped he death and vengeful of his wrong
to pylos drove the lowing herds along
then  he so sought a foreign air
argos the rich for his retreat he chose
there formd his empire there his palace rose
from him antiphates and mantius came
the first begot oicleus great in fame
and he amphiaraus immortal name
the peoples saviour and divinely wise
beloved by jove and him who gilds the skies
yet short his date of life by female pride he dies
from mantius clitus whom auroras love
snatchd for his beauty to the thrones above
and polyphides on whom phœbus shone
with fullest rays amphiaraus now gone
in hyperesias groves he made abode
and taught mankind the counsels of the god
from him sprung theoclymenus who found

telemachus whom as to heaven he pressd
his ardent vows the stranger thus addressd

o thou that dost thy happy course prepare
with pure libations and with solemn prayer
by that dread power to whom thy vows are paid
by all the lives of these thy own dear head
declare sincerely to no foes demand
thy name thy lineage and paternal land

prepare then  to know
a tale from falsehood free not free from woe
from ithaca of royal birth i came
and great ulysses 
once was my sire though now for ever lost
in stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost
whose fate inquiring through the world we rove
the last the wretched proof of filial love

the stranger then nor shall i aught conceal
but the dire secret of my fate reveal
of my own tribe an argive wretch i slew
whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue
with unrelenting rage and force from home
the bloodstaind exile ever doomd to roam
but bear oh bear me oer yon azure flood
receive the suppliant spare my destined blood

stranger  securely rest
affianced in our faith henceforth our guest
thus affable ulysses godlike heir
takes from the strangers hand the glittering spear
he climbs the ship ascends the stern with haste
and by his side the guest accepted placed
the chief his order gives the obedient band
with due observance wait the chiefs command
with speed the mast they rear with speed unbind
the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind
minerva calls the ready gales obey
with rapid speed to whirl them oer the sea
crunus they passd next chalcis rolld away
with thickening darkness closed the doubtful day
the silver phaeas glittering rills they lost
and skimmd along by elis sacred coast
then cautious through the rocky reaches wind
and turning sudden shun the death designd

meantime the king eumaeus and the rest
sate in the cottage at their rural feast
the banquet passd and satiate every man
to try his host ulysses thus began

yet one night more my friends indulge your guest
the last i purpose in your walls to rest
tomorrow for myself i must provide
and only ask your counsel and a guide
patient to roam the street by hunger led
and bless the friendly hand that gives me bread
there in ulysses roof i may relate
ulysses wanderings to his royal mate
or mingling with the suitors haughty train
not undeserving some support obtain
hermes to me his various gifts imparts
patron of industry and manual arts
few can with me in dexterous works contend
the pyre to build the stubborn oak to rend
to turn the tasteful viand oer the flame
or foam the goblet with a purple stream
such are the tasks of men of mean estate
whom fortune dooms to serve the rich and great

alas 
how sprung a thought so monstrous in thy mind
if on that godless race thou wouldst attend
fate owes thee sure a miserable end
their wrongs and blasphemies ascend the sky
and pull descending vengeance from on high
not such my friend the servants of their feast
a blooming train in rich embroidery dressd
with earths whole tribute the bright table bends
and smiling round celestial youth attends
stay then no eye askance beholds thee here
sweet is thy converse to each social ear
well pleased and pleasing in our cottage rest
till good telemachus accepts his guest
with genial gifts and change of fair attires
and safe conveys thee where thy soul desires

to him the man of woes o gracious jove
reward this strangers hospitable love
who knows the son of sorrow to relieve
cheers the sad heart nor lets affliction grieve
of all the ills unhappy mortals know
a life of wanderings is the greatest woe
on all their weary ways wait care and pain
and pine and penury a meagre train
to such a man since harbour you afford
relate the farther fortunes of your lord
what cares his mothers tender breast engage
and sire forsaken on the verge of age
beneath the sun prolong they yet their breath
or range the house of darkness and of death

to whom the swain attend what you enquire
laertes lives the miserable sire
lives but implores of every power to lay
the burden down and wishes for the day
torn from his offspring in the eve of life
torn from the embraces of his tender wife
sole and all comfortless he wastes away
old age untimely posting ere his day
she too sad mother for ulysses lost
pined out her bloom and vanishd to a ghost

while yet she was though clouded oer with grief
her pleasing converse ministerd relief
with climene her youngest daughter bred
one roof containd us and one table fed
but when the softlystealing pace of time
crept on from childhood into youthful prime
to samos isle she sent the wedded fair
me to the fields to tend the rural care
arrayd in garments her own hands had wove
nor less the darling object of her love
her hapless death my brighter days oercast
yet providence deserts me not at last
my present labours food and drink procure
and more the pleasure to relieve the poor
small is the comfort from the queen to hear
unwelcome news or vex the royal ear
blank and discountenanced the servants stand
nor dare to question where the proud command
no profit springs beneath usurping powers
want feeds not there where luxury devours
nor harbours charity where riot reigns
proud are the lords and wretched are the swains

the suffering chief at this began to melt
and o eumaeus thou  hast felt
the spite of fortune too her cruel hand
snatchd thee an infant from thy native land
snatchd from thy parents arms thy parents eyes
to early wants a man of miseries
the whole sad story from its first declare
sunk the fair city by the rage of war
where once thy parents dwelt or did they keep
in humbler life the lowing herds and sheep
so left perhaps to tend the fleecy train
rude pirates seized and shippd thee oer the main
doomd a fair prize to grace some princes board
the worthy purchase of a foreign lord

if then my fortunes can delight my friend
a story fruitful of events attend
anothers sorrow may thy ears enjoy
and wine the lengthend intervals employ
long nights the now declining year bestows
a part we consecrate to soft repose
a part in pleasing talk we entertain
for too much rest itself becomes a pain
let those whom sleep invites the call obey
their cares resuming with the dawning day
here let us feast and to the feast be joind
discourse the sweeter banquet of the mind
review the series of our lives and taste
the melancholy joy of evils passd
for he who much has sufferd much will know
and pleased remembrance builds delight on woe

above ortygia lies an isle of fame
far hence remote and syria is the name

not large but fruitful stored with grass to keep
the bellowing oxen and the bleating sheep
her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn
and her rich valleys wave with golden corn
no want no famine the glad natives know
nor sink by sickness to the shades below
but when a length of years unnerves the strong
apollo comes and cynthia comes along
they bend the silver bow with tender skill
and void of pain the silent arrows kill
two equal tribes this fertile land divide
where two fair cities rise with equal pride
but both in constant peace one prince obey
and ctesius there my father holds the sway
freighted it seems with toys of every sort
a ship of sidon anchord in our port
what time it chanced the palace entertaind
skilld in rich works a woman of their land
this nymph where anchord the phoenician train
to wash her robes descending to the main
a smooth tongued sailor won her to his mind

a sudden trust from sudden liking grew
she told her name her race and all she knew
i too  from glorious sidon came
my father arybas of wealthy fame
but snatchd by pirates from my native place
the taphians sold me to this mans embrace

haste then 
haste to thy country love shall be thy guide
haste to thy fathers house thy fathers breast
for still he lives and lives with riches blest

swear first  ye sailors to restore
a wretch in safety to her native shore
swift as she askd the ready sailors swore
she then proceeds now let our compact made
be nor by signal nor by word betrayd
nor near me any of your crew descried
by road frequented or by fountain side
be silence still our guard the monarchs spies

are still at hand and this revealed must be
death to yourselves eternal chains to me
your vessel loaded and your traffic passd
despatch a wary messenger with haste
then gold and costly treasures will i bring
and more the infant offspring of the king
him childlike wandering forth ill lead away
 and to your ship convey

thus spoke the dame and homeward took the road
a year they traffic and their vessel load
their stores complete and ready now to weigh
a spy was sent their summons to convey
an artist to my fathers palace came
with gold and amber chains elaborate frame
each female eye the glittering links employ
they turn review and cheapen every toy
he took the occasion as they stood intent
gave her the sign and to his vessel went
she straight pursued and seized my willing arm
i followd smiling innocent of harm
three golden goblets in the porch she found

hid in her fraudful bosom these she bore
now set the sun and darkend all the shore
arriving then where tilting on the tides
prepared to launch the freighted vessel rides
aboard they heave us mount their decks and sweep
with level oar along the glassy deep
six calmy days and six smooth nights we sail
and constant jove supplied the gentle gale
the seventh the fraudful wretch 
touchd by dianas vengeful arrow died
down droppd the caitiffcorse a worthless load
down to the deep there rolld the future food
of fierce seawolves and monsters of the flood
an helpless infant i remaind behind
thence borne to ithaca by wave and wind
sold to laertes by divine command
and now adopted to a foreign land

to him the king reciting thus thy cares
my secret soul in all thy sorrow shares
but one choice blessing 
has sweetend all thy bitter draught of ill
torn from thy country to no hapless end
the gods have in a master given a friend
whatever frugal nature needs is thine
 daily bread and wine
while i so many wanderings past and woes
live but on what thy poverty bestows

so passed in pleasing dialogue away
the night then down to short repose they lay
till radiant rose the messenger of day
while in the port of ithaca the band
of young telemachus approachd the land
their sails they loosed they lashd the mast aside
and cast their anchors and the cables tied
then on the breezy shore descending join
in grateful banquet oer the rosy wine
when thus the prince now each his course pursue
i to the fields and to the city you
long absent hence i dedicate this day
my swains to visit and the works survey
expect me with the morn to pay the skies
our debt of safe return in feast and sacrifice

then theoclymenus but who shall lend
meantime protection to thy stranger friend
straight to the queen and palace shall i fly
or yet more distant to some lord apply

the prince returnd renownd in days of yore
has stood our fathers hospitable door
no other roof a stranger should receive
no other hands than ours the welcome give
but in my absence riot fills the place
nor bears the modest queen a strangers face
from noiseful revel far remote she flies
but rarely seen or seen with weeping eyes
nolet eurymachus receive my guest
of nature courteous and by far the best
he woos the queen with more respectful flame
and emulates her former husbands fame
with what success tis joves alone to know
and the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe

thus speaking on the right upsoard in air
the hawk apollos swiftwingd messenger
his dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove
the clotted feathers scatterd from above
between the hero and the vessel pour
thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower

the observing augur took the prince aside
seized by the hand and thus prophetic cried
yon bird that dexter cuts the aërial road
rose ominous nor flies without a god
no race but thine shall ithaca obey
to thine for ages heaven decrees the sway

succeed the omens gods 
soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind
and soon each envied happiness attend
the man who calls telemachus his friend
then to peiraeus thou whom time has proved
a faithful servant by thy prince beloved
till we returning shall our guest demand
accept this charge with honour at our hand

to this peiraeus joyful i obey
well pleased the hospitable rites to pay
the presence of thy guest shall best reward
 the absence of my lord

with that their anchors he commands to weigh
mount the tall bark and launch into the sea
all with obedient haste forsake the shores
and placed in order spread their equal oars
then from the deck the prince his sandals takes
poised in his hand the pointed javelin shakes
they part while lessening from the heros view
swift to the town the wellrowd galley flew
the hero trod the margin of the main
and reachd the mansion of his faithful swain





soon as the morning blushd along the plains
ulysses and the monarch of the swains
awake the sleeping fires their meals prepare
and forth to pasture send the bristly care
the princes near approach the dogs descry
and fawning round his feet confess their joy
their gentle blandishment the king surveyd
heard his resounding step and instant said

some wellknown friend eumaeus bends this way
his steps i hear the dogs familiar play

while yet he spoke the prince advancing drew
nigh to the lodge and now appeard in view
transported from his seat eumaeus sprung
droppd the full bowl and round his bosom hung
kissing his cheek his hand while from his eye
the tears raind copious in a shower of joy
as some fond sire who ten long winters grieves
from foreign climes an only son receives
 with strong paternal joy
forward he springs and clasps the favourite boy
so round the youth his arms eumaeus spread
as if the grave had given him from the dead

and is it thou my everdear delight
oh art thou come to bless my longing sight
never i never hoped to view this day
when oer the waves you ploughd the desperate way
enter my child beyond my hopes restored
oh give these eyes to feast upon their lord
enter oh seldom seen for lawless powers
too much detain thee from these sylvan bowers
the prince replied eumaeus i obey
to seek thee friend i hither took my way
but say if in the court the queen reside
severely chaste or if commenced a bride

thus he and thus the monarch of the swains
severely chaste penelope remains
but lost to every joy she wastes the day
in tedious cares and weeps the night away

he ended and 
they reachd the dome the dome with marble shined
his seat ulysses to the prince resignd
not so 
for me this house shall find an humbler place
to usurp the honours due to silver hairs
and reverend strangers modest youth forbears
instant the swain the spoils of beasts supplies
and bids the rural throne with osiers rise
there sate the prince the feast eumaeus spread
and heapd the shining canisters with bread
thick oer the board the plenteous viands lay
the frugal remnants of the former day
then in a bowl he tempers generous wines
around whose verge a mimic ivy twines
and now the rage of thirst and hunger fled
thus young ulysses to eumaeus said

whence father from what shore this stranger say
what vessel bore him oer the watery way
to human step our land impervious lies
and round the coast circumfluent oceans rise

the swain returns a tale of sorrows hear
in spacious crete he drew his natal air
long doomd to wander oer the land and main
for heaven has wove his thread of life with pain
half breathless scaping to the land he flew
from thesprot mariners a murderous crew
to thee my son the suppliant i resign
i gave him my protection grant him thine

hard task  thy virtue gives thy friend
willing to aid unable to defend
can strangers safely in the court reside
midst the swelld insolence of lust and pride
een i unsafe the queen in doubt to wed
or pay due honours to the nuptial bed
perhaps she weds regardless of her fame
deaf to the mighty ulyssean name
however stranger from our grace receive
such honours as befit a prince to give
sandals a sword and robes respect to prove
and safe to sail with ornaments of love
till then thy guest amid the rural train
far from the court from danger far detain
tis mine with food the hungry to supply
and clothe the naked from the inclement sky
here dwell in safety from the suitors wrongs
and the rude insults of ungovernd tongues
for shouldst thou suffer powerless to relieve
i must behold it and can only grieve
the brave encompassd by an hostile train
oerpowerd by numbers is but brave in vain

to whom while anger in his bosom glows
with warmth replies the man of mighty woes
since audience mild is deignd permit my tongue
at once to pity and resent thy wrong
my heart weeps blood to see a soul so brave
live to base insolence or power a slave
but tell me dost thou prince dost thou behold
and hear their midnight revels uncontrolld
say do thy subjects in bold faction rise
or priests in fabled oracles advise
or are thy brothers who should aid thy power
turnd mean deserters in the needful hour
oh that i were from great ulysses sprung
or that these witherd nerves like thine were strung
or heavens might he return 
might he return i yield my life a prey
to my worst foe if that avenging day
be not their last but should i lose my life
oppressd by numbers in the glorious strife
i chose the nobler part and yield my breath
rather than bear dishonor worse than death
than see the hand of violence invade
the reverend stranger and the spotless maid
than see the wealth of kings consumed in waste
the drunkards revel and the gluttons feast

thus he with anger flashing from his eye
sincere the youthful hero made reply
nor leagued in factious arms my subjects rise
nor priests in fabled oracles advise
nor are my brothers who should aid my power
turnd mean deserters in the needful hour
ah me i boast no brother heavens dread king
gives from our stock an only branch to spring
alone laertes reignd arcesius heir
alone ulysses drew the vital air
and i alone the bed connubial graced
an unblessd offspring of a sire unblessd
each neighbouring realm conducive to our woe
sends forth her peers and every peer a foe
the court proud samos and dulichium fills
and lofty zacinth crownd with shady hills
een ithaca and all her lords invade
the imperial sceptre and the regal bed
the queen averse to love yet awed by power
seems half to yield yet flies the bridal hour
meantime their licence uncontrolld i bear
een now they envy me the vital air
but heaven will sure revenge and gods there are

but go eumaeus to the queen impart
our safe return and ease a mothers heart
yet secret go for numerous are my foes
and here at least i may in peace repose

to whom the swain i hear and i obey
but old laertes weeps his life away
and deems thee lost shall i my speed employ
to bless his age a messenger of joy
the mournful hour that tore his son away
sent the sad sire in solitude to stray
yet busied with his slaves to ease his woe
he dressd the vine and bade the garden blow
nor food nor wine refused but since the day
that you to pylos ploughd the watery way
nor wine nor food he tastes but sunk in woes
wild springs the vine no more the garden blows
shut from the walks of men to pleasure lost
pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost

wretched old man 
yet cease to gowhat man so blest but mourns
were every wish indulged by favouring skies
this hour should give ulysses to my eyes
but to the queen with speed dispatchful bear
our safe return and back with speed repair
and let some handmaid of her train resort
to good laertes in his rural court

while yet he spoke impatient of delay
he braced his sandals on and strode away
then from the heavens the martial goddess flies
through the wild fields of air and cleaves the skies
in form a virgin in soft beautys bloom
skilld in the illustrious labours of the loom
alone to ithaca she stood displayd
but unapparent as a viewless shade
escaped telemachus 
the dogs intelligent confessd the tread
of power divine and howling trembling fled
the goddess beckoning waves her deathless hands
dauntless the king before the goddess stands

then why  o favourd of the skies
why to thy godlike son this long disguise
stand forth reveald with him thy cares employ
against thy foes be valiant and destroy
lo i descend in that avenging hour
to combat by thy side thy guardian power

she said and oer him waves her wand of gold
imperial robes his manly limbs infold
at once with grace divine his frame improves
at once with majesty enlarged he moves
youth flushd his reddening cheek and from his brows
a length of hair in sable ringlets flows
his blackening chin receives a deeper shade
then from his eyes upsprung the warriormaid

the hero reascends the prince oerawed
scarce lifts his eyes and bows as to a god
then with surprise 
how art thou changed a god appears
far other vests thy limbs majestic grace
far other glories lighten from thy face
if heaven be thy abode with pious care
lo i the ready sacrifice prepare
lo gifts of labourd gold adorn thy shrine
to win thy grace o save us power divine

few are my days 
nor i alas descendant of the sky
i am thy father o my son my son
that father for whose sake thy days have run
one scene of woe to endless cares consignd
and outraged by the wrongs of base mankind

then rushing to his arms he kissd his boy
with the strong raptures of a parents joy
tears bathe his cheek and tears the ground bedew
he straind him close as to his breast he grew
ah me 
thou art notno thou canst not be my sire
heaven such illusion only can impose
by the false joy to aggravate my woes
who but a god can change the general doom
and give to witherd age a youthful bloom
late worn with years in weeds obscene you trod
now clothed in majesty you move a god

forbear  for heaven reserve that name
give to thy father but a fathers claim
other ulysses shalt thou never see
i am ulysses i my son am he
twice ten sad years oer earth and ocean tossd
tis given at length to view my native coast
pallas unconquerd maid my frame surrounds
with grace divine her power admits no bounds
she oer my limbs old age and wrinkles shed
now strong as youth magnificent i tread
the gods with ease frail man depress or raise
exalt the lowly or the proud debase

he spoke and sate the prince with transport flew
hung round his neck while tears his cheek bedew
nor less the father pourd a social flood
they wept abundant and they wept aloud
as the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung
or parent vulture mourns her ravishd young
they cry they scream their unfledged brood a prey
to some rude churl and borne by stealth away
so they aloud and tears in tides had run
their grief unfinishd with the setting sun
but checking the full torrent in its flow
the prince thus interrupts the solemn woe
what ship transported thee o father say
and what blessd hands have oard thee on the way

all all 
i tell thee all my child my only joy
phæacians bore me to the port assignd
a nation ever to the stranger kind
wrappd in the embrace of sleep the faithful train
oer seas conveyd me to my native reign
embroiderd vestures gold and brass are laid
conceald in caverns in the sylvan shade
hither intent the rival rout to slay
and plan the scene of death i bend my way
so pallas willsbut thou my son explain
the names and numbers of the audacious train
tis mine to judge if better to employ
assistant force or singly to destroy

oer earth  resounds thy name
thy welltried wisdom and thy martial fame
yet at thy words i start in wonder lost
can we engage not decades but an host
can we alone in furious battle stand
against that numerous and determined band
hear then their numbers from dulichium came
twice twentysix all peers of mighty name
six are their menial train twice twelve the boast
of samos twenty from zacynthus coast
and twelve our countrys pride to these belong
medon and phemius skilld in heavenly song
two sewers from day to day the revels wait
exact of taste and serve the feast in state
with such a foe the unequal fight to try
were by false courage unrevenged to die
then what assistant powers you boast relate
ere yet we mingle in the stern debate

mark well my voice 
what need of aids if favourd by the skies
if shielded to the dreadful fight we move
by mighty pallas and by thundering jove

sufficient they 
against the banded powers of all mankind
they high enthroned above the rolling clouds
wither the strength of man and awe the gods

such aids expect  when strong in might
we rise terrific to the task of fight
but thou when morn salutes the aërial plain
the court revisit and the lawless train
me thither in disguise eumaeus leads
an aged mendicant in tatterd weeds
there if base scorn insult my reverend age
bear it my son repress thy rising rage
if outraged cease that outrage to repel
bear it my son howeer thy heart rebel
yet strive by prayer and counsel to restrain
their lawless insults though thou strive in vain
for wicked ears are deaf to wisdoms call
and vengeance strikes whom heaven has doomd to fall
once more attend when she whose power inspires
the thinking mind my soul to vengeance fires
i give the sign that instant from beneath
aloft convey the instruments of death
armour and arms and if mistrust arise
thus veil the truth in plausible disguise

these glittering weapons ere he saild to troy
ulysses viewd with stern heroic joy
then beaming oer the illumined wall they shone
now dust dishonours all their lustre gone
i bear them hence 
from the pollution of the fuming fires
lest when the bowl inflames in vengeful mood
ye rush to arms and stain the feast with blood
oft ready swords in luckless hour incite
the hand of wrath and arm it for the fight

such be the plea and by the plea deceive
for jove infatuates all and all believe
yet leave for each of us a sword to wield
a pointed javelin and a fenceful shield
but by my blood that in thy bosom glows
by that regard a son his father owes
the secret that thy father lives retain
lockd in thy bosom from the household train
hide it from all een from eumaeus hide
from my dear father and my dearer bride
one care remains to note the loyal few
whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew
and noting ere we rise in vengeance prove
who love his prince for sure you merit love

to whom the youth to emulate i aim
the brave and wise and my great fathers fame
but reconsider since the wisest err
vengeance resolved tis dangerous to defer
what length of time must we consume in vain
too curious to explore the menial train
while the proud foes industrious to destroy
thy wealth in riot the delay enjoy
suffice it in this exigence alone
to mark the damsels that attend the throne
dispersed the youth reside their faith to prove
jove grants henceforth if thou hast spoke from jove

while in debate they waste the hours away
the associates of the prince repassd the bay
with speed they guide the vessel to the shores
with speed debarking land the naval stores
then faithful to their charge to clytius bear
and trust the presents to his friendly care
swift to the queen a herald flies to impart
her sons return and ease a parents heart
lest a sad prey to evermusing cares
pale grief destroy what time awhile forbears
the incautious herald with impatience burns
and cries aloud thy son o queen returns
eumaeus sage approachd the imperial throne
and breathed his mandate to her ear alone
then measured back the way the suitor band
stung to the soul abashd confounded stand
and issuing from the dome before the gate
with clouded looks a pale assembly sate

at length eurymachus our hopes are vain
telemachus in triumph sails the main
haste rear the mast the swelling shroud display
haste to our ambushd friends the news convey

scarce had he spake when turning to the strand
amphinomus surveyd the associate band
full to the bay within the winding shores
with gatherd sails they stood and lifted oars
o friends he cried elate with rising joy
see to the port secure the vessel fly
some god has told them or themselves survey
the bark escaped and measure back their way

swift at the word descending to the shores
they moor the vessel and unlade the stores
then moving from the strand apart they sate
and full and frequent formd a dire debate

lives then the boy he lives 
the care of gods and favourite of the skies
all night we watchd till with her orient wheels
aurora flamed above the eastern hills
and from the lofty brow of rocks by day
took in the ocean with a broad survey
yet safe he sails the powers celestial give
to shun the hidden snares of death and live
but die he shall and thus condemnd to bleed
be now the scene of instant death decreed
hope ye success undaunted crush the foe
is he not wise know this and strike the blow
wait ye till he to arms in council draws
the greeks averse too justly to our cause
strike ere the states convened the foe betray
our murderous ambush on the watery way
or choose ye vagrant from their rage to fly
outcasts of earth to breathe an unknown sky
the brave prevent misfortune then be brave
and bury future danger in his grave
returns he ambushd well his walk invade
or where he hides in solitude and shade
and give the palace to the queen a dower
or him she blesses in the bridal hour
but if submissive you resign the sway
slaves to a boy go flatter and obey
retire we instant to our native reign
nor be the wealth of kings consumed in vain
then wed whom choice approves the queen be given
to some blest prince the prince decreed by heaven

abashd the suitor train his voice attends
till from his throne amphinomus ascends
who oer dulichium stretchd his spacious reign
a land of plenty blessd with every grain
chief of the numbers who the queen addressd
and though displeasing yet displeasing least
soft were his words his actions wisdom swayd
graceful awhile he paused then mildly said

o friends forbear and be the thought withstood
tis horrible to shed imperial blood
consult we first the allseeing powers above
and the sure oracles of righteous jove
if they assent een by this hand he dies
if they forbid i war not with the skies

he said the rival train his voice approved
and rising instant to the palace moved
arrived with wild tumultuous noise they sate
recumbent on the shining thrones of state

then medon conscious of their dire debates
the murderous counsel to the queen relates
touchd at the dreadful story she descends
her hasty steps a damsel train attends
full where the dome its shining valves expands
sudden before the rival powers she stands
and veiling decent with a modest shade
her cheek indignant to antinous said

o void of faith of all bad men the worst
renownd for wisdom by the abuse accursed
mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind
thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind
wretch to destroy a prince that friendship gives
while in his guest his murderer he receives
nor dread superior jove to whom belong
the cause of suppliants and revenge of wrong
hast thou forgot ungrateful as thou art
who saved thy father with a friendly part
lawless he ravaged with his martial powers
the taphian pirates on thesprotias shores
enraged his life his treasures they demand
ulysses saved him from the avengers hand
and wouldst thou evil for his good repay
his bed dishonour and his house betray
afflict his queen and with a murderous hand
destroy his heirbut cease tis i command

far hence those fears 
o prudent princess bid thy soul confide
breathes there a man who dares that hero slay
while i behold the golden light of day
no by the righteous powers of heaven i swear
his blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear
ulysses when my infant days i led
with wine sufficed me and with dainties fed
my generous soul abhors the ungrateful part
and my friends son lives nearest to my heart
then fear no mortal arm if heaven destroy
we must resign for man is born to die

thus smooth he ended yet his death conspired
then sorrowing with sad step the queen retired
with streaming eyes all comfortless deplored
touchd with the dear remembrance of her lord
nor ceased till pallas bids her sorrows fly
and in soft slumber seald her flowing eye

and now eumaeus at the evening hour
came late returning to his sylvan bower
ulysses and his son had dressd with art
a yearling boar and gave the gods their part
holy repast that instant from the skies
the martial goddess to ulysses flies
she waves her golden wand and reassumes
from every feature every grace that blooms
at once his vestures change at once she sheds
age oer his limbs that tremble as he treads
lest to the queen the swain with transport fly
unable to contain the unruly joy
when near he drew the prince breaks forth proclaim
what tidings friend what speaks the voice of fame
say if the suitors measure back the main
or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain

whether  they measure back the flood
or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood
escaped my care where lawless suitors sway
thy mandate borne my soul disdaind to stay
but from the hermaean height i cast a view
where to the port a bark highbounding flew
her freight a shining band with martial air
each poised his shield and each advanced his spear
and if aright these searching eyes survey
the eluded suitors stem the watery way

the prince well pleased to disappoint their wiles
steals on his sire a glance and secret smiles
and now a short repast prepared they fed
till the keen rage of craving hunger fled
then to repose withdrawn apart they lay
and in soft sleep forgot the cares of day






soon as aurora daughter of the dawn
sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn
in haste the prince arose prepared to part
his hand impatient grasps the pointed dart
fair on his feet the polishd sandals shine
and thus he greets the master of the swine

my friend adieu let this short stay suffice
i haste to meet my mothers longing eyes
and end her tears her sorrows and her sighs
but thou attentive what we order heed
this hapless stranger to the city lead
by public bounty let him there be fed
and bless the hand that stretches forth the bread
to wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes
my will may covet but my power denies
if this raise anger in the strangers thought
the pain of anger punishes the fault
the very truth i undisguised declare
for what so easy as to be sincere

to this ulysses what the prince requires
of swift removal seconds my desires
to want like mine the peopled town can yield
more hopes of comfort than the lonely field
nor fits my age to till the labourd lands
or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands
adieu but since this ragged garb can bear
so ill the inclemencies of morning air
a few hours space permit me here to stay
my steps eumaeus shall to town convey
with riper beams when phœbus warms the day

thus he nor aught telemachus replied
but left the mansion with a lofty stride
schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate
revolving deep the suitors sudden fate
arriving now before the imperial hall
he props his spear against the pillard wall
then like a lion oer the threshold bounds
the marble pavement with his steps resounds
his eye first glanced where euryclea spreads
with furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds
she saw she wept she ran with eager pace
and reachd her master with a long embrace
all crowded round the family appears
with wild entrancement and ecstatic tears
swift from above descends the royal fair

hangs oer her son in his embraces dies
rains kisses on his neck his face his eyes
few words she spoke though much she had to say
and scarce those few for tears could force their way

light of my eyes he comes unhopedfor joy
has heaven from pylos brought my lovely boy
so snatchd from all our carestell hast thou known
thy fathers fate and tell me all thy own

oh dearest most revered of womankind
cease with those tears to melt a manly mind
 nor be our fates deplored
from death and treason to thy arms restored
go bathe and robed in white ascend the towers
with all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers
to every god vow hecatombs to bleed
and call joves vengeance on their guilty deed
while to the assembled council i repair
a stranger sent by heaven attends me there
my new accepted guest i haste to find
now to peiraeus honourd charge consignd

the matron heard nor was his word in vain
she bathed and robed in white with all her train
to every god vowd hecatombs to bleed
and calld joves vengeance on the guilty deed
armd with his lance the prince then passd the gate
two dogs behind a faithful guard await
pallas his form with grace divine improves
the gazing crowd admires him as he moves
him gathering round the haughty suitors greet
with semblance fair but inward deep deceit
their false addresses generous he denied
passd on and sate by faithful mentors side
with antiphus and halitherses sage

of his own fortunes and ulysses fame
much askd the seniors till peiraeus came
the strangerguest pursued him close behind
whom when telemachus beheld he joind
he 
thus thoughtful answerd those we shall not move
dark and unconscious of the will of jove
we know not yet the full event of all
stabbd in his palace if your prince must fall
us and our house if treason must oerthrow
better a friend possess them than a foe
if death to these and vengeance heaven decree
riches are welcome then not else to me
till then retain the giftsthe hero said
and in his hand the willing stranger led
then disarrayd the shining bath they sought
 of polishd marble wrought
obedient handmaids with assistant toil
supply the limpid wave and fragrant oil
then oer their limbs refulgent robes they threw
and fresh from bathing to their seats withdrew
the golden ewer a nymph attendant brings
replenishd from the pure translucent springs
with copious streams that golden ewer supplies
a silver layer of capacious size
they wash the table in fair order spread
is piled with viands and the strength of bread
full opposite before the folding gate
the pensive mother sits in humble state
lowly she sate and with dejected view
the fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew
the prince and stranger shared the genial feast
till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased

when thus the queen my son my only friend
say to my mournful couch shall i ascend

say wilt thou not 
say wilt thou not the least account afford
the least glad tidings of my absent lord

to her the youth we reachd the pylian plains
where nestor shepherd of his people reigns
all arts of tenderness to him are known
kind to ulysses race as to his own
no father with a fonder grasp of joy
strains to his bosom his longabsent boy
but all unknown if yet ulysses breathe
or glide a spectre in the realms beneath
for farther search his rapid steeds transport
my lengthend journey to the spartan court
there argive helen i beheld whose charms
 engaged the great in arms
my cause of coming told he thus rejoind
and still his words live perfect in my mind

heavens would a soft inglorious dastard train
an absent heros nuptial joys profane
so with her young amid the woodland shades
a timorous hind the lions court invades
leaves in that fatal lair her tender fawns
and climbs the cliffs or feeds along the lawns
meantime returning with remorseless sway
the monarch savage rends the panting prey
with equal fury and with equal fame
shall great ulysses reassert his claim
o jove supreme whom men and gods revere
and thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere
with power congenial joind propitious aid
the chief adopted by the martial maid
such to our wish the warrior soon restore
as when contending on the lesbian shore
his prowess philomelides confessd
and loud acclaiming greeks the victor blessd
then soon the invaders of his bed and throne
their love presumptuous shall by death atone
now what you question of my ancient friend
with truth i answer thou the truth attend
learn what i heard the seaborn seer relate
whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate
sole in an isle imprisond by the main
the sad survivor of his numerous train
ulysses lies detaind by magic charms
and pressd unwilling in calypsos arms
no sailors there no vessels to convey
no oars to cut the immeasurable way
this told atrides and he told no more
then safe i voyaged to my native shore

he ceased nor made the pensive queen reply
but droopd her head and drew a secret sigh
when theoclymenus the seer began
o suffering consort of the suffering man
what human knowledge could those kings might tell
but i the secrets of high heaven reveal
before the first of gods be this declared
before the board whose blessings we have shared
witness the genial rites and witness all
this house holds sacred in her ample wall
een now this instant great ulysses laid
at rest or wandering in his countrys shade
their guilty deeds in hearing and in view
secret revolves and plans the vengeance due
of this sure auguries the gods bestowd
when first our vessel anchord in your road
succeed those omens heaven 
so shall our bounties speak a grateful mind
and every envied happiness attend
the man who calls penelope his friend
thus communed they while in the marble court
 the lords resort
athwart the spacious square each tries his art
to whirl the disk or aim the missile dart
now did the hour of sweet repast arrive
and from the field the victim flocks they drive
medon the herald 
to bid the banquet interrupts their play
swift to the hall they haste aside they lay
their garments and succinct the victims slay
then sheep and goats and bristly porkers bled
and the proud steer was oer the marble spread
while thus the copious banquet they provide
along the road conversing side by side
proceed ulysses and the faithful swain
when thus eumaeus generous and humane
to town observant of our lords behest
now let us speed my friend no more my guest
yet like myself i wish thee here preferrd
guard of the flock or keeper of the herd
but much to raise my masters wrath i fear
the wrath of princes ever is severe
then heed his will and be our journey made
while the broad beams of phœbus are displayd
or ere brown evening spreads her chilly shade
just thy advice 
and such as suits the dictate of my mind
lead on but help me to some staff to stay
my feeble step since rugged is the way
across his shoulders then the scrip he flung
widepatchd and fastend by a twisted thong
a staff eumaeus gave along the way
cheerly they fare behind the keepers stay
these with their watchful dogs 
supply his absence and attend the herd
and now his city strikes the monarchs eyes
alas how changed a man of miseries
proppd on a staff a beggar old and bare
in rags dishonest fluttering with the air
now passd the rugged road they journey down
the cavernd way descending to the town
where from the rock with liquid drops distils
a limpid fount that spread in parting rills
its current thence to serve the city brings
an useful work adornd by ancient kings
neritus ithacus polyctor there
in sculptured stone immortalized their care
in marble urns received it from above
and shaded with a green surrounding grove
where silver alders in high arches twined
drink the cool stream and tremble to the wind
beneath sequesterd to the nymphs is seen
a mossy altar deep embowerd in green
where constant vows by travellers are paid
and holy horrors solemnize the shade

here with his goats  melanthius came
two grooms attend him with an envious look
he eyed the stranger and imperious spoke

the good old proverb how this pair fulfil
one rogue is usher to another still
heaven with a secret principle endued
mankind to seek their own similitude
where goes the swineherd with that illlookd guest
that giantglutton dreadful at a feast
full many a post have those broad shoulders worn
from every great mans gate repulsed with scorn
to no brave prize aspired the worthless swain
twas but for scraps he askd and askd in vain
to beg than work he better understands
or we perhaps might take him off thy hands
for any office could the slave be good
to cleanse the fold or help the kids to food
if any labour those big joints could learn
some whey to wash his bowels he might earn
to cringe to whine his idle hands to spread
is all by which that graceless maw is fed
yet hear me if thy impudence but dare
approach yon wall i prophesy thy fare
dearly full dearly shalt thou buy thy bread
with many a footstool thundering at thy head

he thus nor insolent of word alone
spurnd with his rustic heel his king unknown
spurnd but not moved he like a pillar stood
nor stirrd an inch contemptuous from the road
doubtful or with his staff to strike him dead
or greet the pavement with his worthless head
short was that doubt to quell his rage inured
the hero stood selfconquerd and endured
but hateful of the wretch eumaeus heaved
his hands obtesting and this prayer conceived
daughters of jove who from the ethereal bowers
descend to swell the springs and feed the flowers
nymphs of this fountain to whose sacred names
our rural victims mount in blazing flames
to whom ulysses piety preferrd
the yearly firstlings of his flock and herd
succeed my wish your votary restore
oh be some god his convoy to our shore
due pains shall punish then this slaves offence
and humble all his airs of insolence
who proudly stalking leaves the herds at large
commences courtier and neglects his charge

what mutters he 
this crafty miscreant big with dark designs
the day shall comenay tis already near
when slave to sell thee at a price too dear
must be my care and hence transport thee oer
a load and scandal to this happy shore
oh that as surely great apollos dart
or some brave suitors sword might pierce the heart
of the proud son as that we stand this hour
in lasting safety from the fathers power

so spoke the wretch but shunning farther fray
turnd his proud step and left them on their way
straight to the feastful palace he repaird
familiar enterd and the banquet shared
beneath eurymachus his patron lord
he took his place and plenty heapd the board

meantime they heard soft circling in the sky
sweet airs ascend and heavenly minstrelsy

ulysses hearkend then addressd the swain

well may this palace admiration claim
great and respondent to the masters fame
stage above stage the imperial structure stands
holds the chief honours and the town commands
high walls and battlements the courts inclose
and the strong gates defy a host of foes
far other cares its dwellers now employ
the throngd assembly and the feast of joy
i see the smokes of sacrifice aspire
and hear  the lyre

then thus eumaeus judge we which were best
amidst yon revellers a sudden guest
choose you to mingle while behind i stay
or i first entering introduce the way
wait for a space without but wait not long
this is the house of violence and wrong
some rude insult thy reverend age may bear
for like their lawless lords the servants are

just is o friend thy caution and addressd

the wrongs and injuries of base mankind
fresh to my sense and always in my mind
the bravelypatient to no fortune yields
on rolling oceans and in fighting fields
storms have i passd and many a stern debate
and now in humbler scene submit to fate
what cannot want the best she will expose
and i am learnd in all her train of woes
she fills with navies hosts and loud alarms
the sea the land and shakes the world with arms

thus near the gates conferring as they drew
argus the dog his ancient master knew
he not unconscious of the voice and tread
lifts to the sound his ear and rears his head
bred by ulysses nourishd at his board
but ah not fated long to please his lord
to him his swiftness and his strength were vain
the voice of glory calld him oer the main
till then in every sylvan chase renownd
with argus argus rung the woods around
with him the youth pursued the goat or fawn
or traced the mazy leveret oer the lawn
now left to mans ingratitude he lay
unhoused neglected in the public way
and where on heaps the rich manure was spread
obscene with reptiles took his sordid bed

he knew his lord he knew and strove to meet
in vain he strove to crawl and kiss his feet
yet  his tail his tears his eyes
salute his master and confess his joys
soft pity touchd the mighty masters soul
adown his cheek a tear unbidden stole
stole unperceived he turnd his head and dried
the drop humane then thus impassiond cried

what noble beast in this abandond state
lies here all helpless at ulysses gate
his bulk and beauty speak no vulgar praise
if as he seems he was in better days
some care his age deserves or was he prized
for worthless beauty therefore now despised
such dogs and men there are mere things of state
and always cherishd by their friends the great

not argus so 
but served a master of a nobler kind
who never never shall behold him more
long long since perishd on a distant shore
oh had you seen him vigorous bold and young
swift as a stag and as a lion strong
him no fell savage on the plain withstood
none scaped him bosomd in the gloomy wood
his eye how piercing and his scent how true
to wind the vapour on the tainted dew
such when ulysses left his natal coast
now years unnerve him and his lord is lost
the women keep the generous creature bare
a sleek and idle race is all their care
the master gone the servants what restrains
or dwells humanity where riot reigns
jove fixd it certain that whatever day
makes man a slave takes half his worth away

this said the honest herdsman strode before
the musing monarch pauses at the door
the dog whom fate had granted to behold
his lord when twenty tedious years had rolld
takes a last look and having seen him dies
so closed for ever faithful argus eyes

and now telemachus the first of all
observed eumaeus entering in the hall
distant he saw across the shady dome
then gave a sign and beckond him to come
there stood an empty seat where late was placed
in order due the steward of the feast

eumaeus took and placed it near his lord
before him instant was the banquet spread
and the bright basket piled with loaves of bread

next came ulysses lowly at the door
a figure despicable old and poor
in squalid vests with many a gaping rent
proppd on a staff and trembling as he went
then resting on the threshold of the gate
against a cypress pillar leand his weight
smoothd by the workman to a polishd plane
the thoughtful son beheld and calld his swain

these viands and this bread eumaeus bear
and let yon mendicant our plenty share
and let him circle round the suitors board
and try the bounty of each gracious lord
bold let him ask encouraged thus by me
how ill alas do want and shame agree

his lords command the faithful servant bears
the seeming beggar answers with his prayers
blessd be telemachus in every deed
inspire him jove in every wish succeed
this said the portion from his son conveyd
with smiles receiving on his scrip he laid
long has the minstrel swept the sounding wire
he fed and ceased when silence held the lyre
soon as the suitors from the banquet rose
minerva prompts the man of mighty woes
to tempt their bounties with a suppliants art
and learn the generous from the ignoble heart

with speaking eyes and voice of plaintive sound
humble he moves imploring all around
the proud feel pity and relief bestow
with such an image touchd of human woe
inquiring all their wonder they confess
and eye the man majestic in distress

while thus they gaze and question with their eyes
the bold melanthius to their thought replies
my lords this stranger of gigantic port
the good eumaeus usherd to your court
full well i markd the features of his face
though all unknown his clime or noble race

and is this present swineherd of thy band
bringst thou these vagrants to infest the land

objects uncouth to check the genial joy
enough of these our court already grace
of giant stomach and of famishd face
such guests eumaeus to his country brings
to share our feast and lead the life of kings

to whom the hospitable swain rejoins
thy passion prince belies thy knowing mind
who calls from distant nations to his own
the poor distinguishd by their wants alone
round the wide world are sought those men divine
who public structures raise or who design
those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal
or bless with salutary arts to heal
but chief to poets such respect belongs
by rival nations courted for their songs
these states invite and mighty kings admire
wide as the sun displays his vital fire
it is not so with want how few that feed
a wretch unhappy merely for his need
unjust to me and all that serve the state
to love ulysses is to raise thy hate
for me suffice the approbation won
of my great mistress and her godlike son

to him telemachus no more incense
the man by nature prone to insolence
injurious minds just answers but provoke
then turning to antinous thus he spoke
thanks to thy care whose absolute command
thus drives the stranger from our court and land
heaven bless its owner with a better mind
from envy free to charity inclined
this both penelope and i afford
then prince be bounteous of ulysses board
to give anothers is thy hand so slow
so much more sweet to spoil than to bestow

whence great telemachus this lofty strain

portions like mine if every suitor gave
our walls this twelvemonth should not see the slave

he spoke and lifting high above the board
his ponderous footstool shook it at his lord
the rest with equal hand conferrd the bread
he filld his scrip and to the threshold sped
but first before antinous stoppd and said
bestow my friend thou dost not seem the worst
of all the greeks but princelike and the first
then as in dignity be first in worth
and i shall praise thee through the boundless earth
once i enjoyd in luxury of state
whateer gives man the envied name of great
wealth servants friends were mine in better days
and hospitality was then my praise
in every sorrowing soul i pourd delight
and poverty stood smiling in my sight
but jove allgoverning whose only will
determines fate and mingles good with ill
sent me 
with roving pirates oer the egyptian main
by egypts silver flood our ships we moor
our spies commissiond straight the coast explore
but impotent of mind the lawless will
the country ravage and the natives kill
the spreading clamour to their city flies
and horse and foot in mingled tumults rise
the reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields
horrid with bristly spears and gleaming shields
jove thunderd on their side our guilty head
we turnd to flight the gathering vengeance spread
on all parts round and heaps on heaps lay dead
some few the foe in servitude detain
death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain
unhappy me a cyprian took aboard
and gave to dmetor cyprus haughty lord
hither to scape his chains my course i steer
still cursed by fortune and insulted here

to whom antinous thus his rage expressd
what god has plagued us with this gourmand guest
unless at distance wretch thou keep behind
another isle than cyprus more unkind
another egypt shalt thou quickly find
from all thou beggst a bold audacious slave
nor all can give so much as thou canst crave
nor wonder i at such profusion shown
shameless they give who give whats not their own

the chief retiring souls like that in thee
ill suits such forms of grace and dignity
nor will that hand to utmost need afford
the smallest portion of a wasteful board
whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps
yet starving want amidst the riot weeps

the haughty suitor with resentment burns
and sourly smiling this reply returns
take that ere yet thou quit this princely throng
and dumb for ever be thy slanderous tongue
he said and high the whirling tripod flung
his shoulderblade received the ungentle shock
he stood and moved not like a marble rock
but shook his thoughtful head nor more complaind
sedate of soul his character sustaind
and inly formd revenge then back withdrew
before his feet the well filld scrip he threw
and thus with semblance mild addressd the crew

may what i speak your princely minds approve
ye peers and rivals in this noble love
not for the hurt i grieve but for the cause
if when the sword our countrys quarrel draws
or if defending what is justly dear
from mars impartial some broad wound we bear
the generous motive dignifies the scar
but for mere want how hard to suffer wrong
want brings enough of other ills along
yet if injustice never be secure
if fiends revenge and gods assert the poor
death shall lay low the proud aggressors head
and make the dust antinous bridal bed

peace wretch and eat thy bread without offence
 or force shall drag thee hence
scourge through the public street and cast thee there
a mangled carcase for the hounds to tear

his furious deed the general anger moved
all even the worst condemnd and some reproved
was ever chief for wars like these renownd
ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound
unblessd thy hand if in this low disguise
wander perhaps some inmate of the skies
they  deign
in forms like these to round the earth and main
just and unjust recording in their mind
and with sure eyes inspecting all mankind

telemachus absorbd in thought severe
nourishd deep anguish though he shed no tear
but the dark brow of silent sorrow shook
while thus his mother to her virgins spoke

on him and his may the bright god of day
that base inhospitable blow repay
the nurse replies if jove receives my prayer
not one survives to breathe tomorrows air

all all are foes and mischief is their end
antinous most to gloomy death a friend
 the stranger beggd their grace
and melting pity softend every face
from every other hand redress he found
but fell antinous answerd with a wound
amidst her maids thus spoke the prudent queen
then bade eumaeus call the pilgrim in
much of the experienced man i long to hear
if or his certain eye or listening ear
have learnd the fortunes of my wandering lord
thus she and good eumaeus took the word

a private audience if thy grace impart
the strangers words may ease the royal heart
his sacred eloquence in balm distils
and the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills
three days have spent their beams three nights have run
their silent journey since his tale begun
unfinishd yet and yet i thirst to hear
as when some heaventaught poet charms the ear

time steals away with unregarded wing
and the soul hears him though he cease to sing

ulysses late he saw on cretan ground
 for minos birth renownd
he now but waits the wind to waft him oer
with boundless treasure from thesprotias shore

to this the queen the wanderer let me hear
while yon luxurious race indulge their cheer
devour the grazing ox and browsing goat
and turn my generous vintage down their throat
for wheres an arm like thine ulysses strong
to curb wild riot and to punish wrong

she spoke telemachus then sneezed aloud
constraind his nostril echoed through the crowd
the smiling queen the happy omen blessd

so may these impious fall by fate oppressd
then to eumaeus bring the stranger fly
and if my questions meet a true reply
graced with a decent robe he shall retire
a gift in season which his wants require

thus spoke penelope eumaeus flies
in duteous haste and to ulysses cries
the queen invites thee venerable guest
a secret instinct moves her troubled breast
of her long absent lord from thee to gain
some light and soothe her souls eternal pain
if true if faithful thou her grateful mind
of decent robes a present has designd
so finding favour in the royal eye
thy other wants her subjects shall supply

fair truth alone 
my words shall dictate and my lips shall guide
to him to me one common lot was given
in equal woes alas involved by heaven
much of his fates i know but checkd by fear
i stand the hand of violence is here
here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade
and injured suppliants seek in vain for aid
let for a space the pensive queen attend
nor claim my story till the sun descend
then in such robes as suppliants may require
composed and cheerful by the genial fire
when loud uproar and lawless riot cease
shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace

swift to the queen returns the gentle swain
and say  does fear or shame detain
the cautious stranger with the begging kind
shame suits but ill eumaeus thus rejoind

he only asks a more propitious hour
and shuns  wicked men in power
at evening mild 
by turns to question and by turns to hear

whoeer this guest 
his every step and every thought is wise
for men like these on earth he shall not find
in all the miscreant race of human kind
thus she eumaeus all her words attends
and parting to the suitor powers descends
there seeks telemachus and thus apart
in whispers breathes the fondness of his heart

the time my lord invites me to repair
hence to the lodge my charge demands my care
these sons of murder thirst thy life to take
o guard it guard it for thy servants sake

thanks to my friend  but now the hour
of night draws on go seek the rural bower
but first refresh and at the dawn of day
hither a victim to the gods convey
our life to heavens immortal powers we trust
safe in their care for heaven protects the just

observant of his voice eumaeus sate
and fed recumbent on a chair of state
then instant rose and as he moved along
twas riot all amid the suitor throng
they feast they dance and raise the mirthful song
till now declining towards the close of day
the sun obliquely shot his dewy ray







while fixd in thought the pensive hero sate
a mendicant approachd the royal gate
a surly vagrant of the giant kind
the stain of manhood of a coward mind
from feast to feast insatiate to devour
he flew attendant on the genial hour
him on his mothers knees when babe he lay
she named arnaeus on his natal day
but irus his associates calld the boy
practised the common messenger to fly
irus a name expressive of the employ

from his own roof with meditated blows
he strove to drive the man of mighty woes

hence dotard hence and timely speed thy way
lest draggd in vengeance thou repent thy stay
see how with nods assent yon princely train
but honouring age in mercy i refrain
in peace away lest if persuasions fail
this arm with blows more eloquent prevail
to whom with stern regard o insolence
indecently to rail without offence
what bounty gives without a rival share
i ask what harms not thee to breathe this air
alike on alms we both precarious live
and canst thou envy when the great relieve
know from the bounteous heavens all riches flow
and what man gives the gods by man bestow
proud as thou art henceforth no more be proud
lest i imprint my vengeance in thy blood
old as i am should once my fury burn
how wouldst thou fly nor een in thought return

mere womanglutton 
a tongue so flippant with a throat so wide
why cease i gods to dash those teeth away
like some wild boars that greedy of his prey
uproots the bearded corn rise try the fight
gird well thy loins approach and feel my might
sure of defeat before the peers engage
unequal fight when youth contends with age

thus in a wordy war their tongues display
more fierce intents preluding to the fray
antinous hears and in a jovial vein
thus with loud laughter to the suitor train

this happy day in mirth my friends employ
and lo the gods conspire to crown our joy
see ready for the fight and hand to hand
yon surly mendicants contentious stand
why urge we not to blows well pleased they spring
swift from their seats and thickening form a ring

to whom antinous lo enrichd with blood
a kids wellfatted entrails 
on glowing embers lie on him bestow
the choicest portion who subdues his foe
grant him unrivalld in these walls to stay
the sole attendant on the genial day

the lords applaud ulysses then with art
and fears wellfeignd disguised his dauntless heart

worn as i am with age decayd with woe
say is it baseness to decline the foe
hard conflict when calamity and age
with vigorous youth unknown to cares engage
yet fearful of disgrace to try the day
imperious hunger bids and i obey
but swear impartial arbiters of right
swear to stand neutral while we cope in fight

the peers assent when straight his sacred head
telemachus upraised and sternly said
stranger if prompted to chastise the wrong
of this bold insolent confide be strong
the injurious greek that dares attempt a blow
that instant makes telemachus his foe
and these my friends shall guard the sacred ties
of hospitality for they are wise

then girding his strong loins the king prepares
to close in combat and his body bares
broad spread his shoulders and his nervous thighs
by just degrees like wellturnd columns rise
ample his chest his arms are round and long
and each strong joint minerva knits more strong
 the suitorcrowd
with wonder gaze and gazing speak aloud
irus alas shall irus be no more
black fate impends and this the avenging hour
gods how his nerves a matchless strength proclaim
swell oer his wellstrong limbs and brace his frame

then pale with fears and sickening at the sight
they draggd the unwilling irus to the fight
from his blank visage fled the coward blood
and his flesh trembled as aghast he stood

o that such baseness should disgrace the light
o hide it death in everlasting night
 can a vigorous foe
meanly decline to combat age and woe
but hear me wretch if recreant in the fray
that huge bulk yield this illcontested day
instant thou sailst to eschetus resignd
a tyrant fiercest of the tyrant kind
who casts thy mangled ears and nose a prey
to hungry dogs and lops the man away

while with indignant scorn he sternly spoke
in every joint the trembling irus shook
now front to front each frowning champion stands
and poises high in air his adverse hands
the chief yet doubts or to the shades below
to fell the giant at one vengeful blow
or save his life and soon his life to save
the king resolves for mercy sways the brave
that instant irus his huge arm extends
full on his shoulder the rude weight descends
the sage ulysses fearful to disclose
the hero latent in the man of woes
checkd half his might yet rising to the stroke
his jawbone dashd the crashing jawbone broke
down droppd he stupid from the stunning wound
his feet extended quivering beat the ground
his mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood
his teeth all shatterd rush inmixd with blood

the peers transported as outstretchd he lies
with bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies
then draggd along all bleeding from the wound
his length of carcase trailing prints the ground
raised on his feet again he reels he falls
till proppd reclining on the palace walls
then to his hand a staff the victor gave
and thus with just reproach addressd the slave
there terrible affright with dogs and reign
a dreaded tyrant oer the bestial train
but mercy to the poor and stranger show
lest heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe

scornful he spoke and oer his shoulder flung
the broadpatchd scrip in tatters hung
ill joind and knotted to a twisted thong
then turning short disdaind a further stay
but to the palace measured back the way
there as he rested gathering in a ring
the peers with smiles addressd their unknown king
stranger may jove and all the aërial powers
with every blessing crown thy happy hours
our freedom to thy prowessd arm we owe
from bold intrusion of thy coward foe
instant the flying sail the slave shall wing
to eschetus the monster of a king

while pleased he hears antinous bears the food
a kids wellfatted entrails rich with blood
the bread from canisters of shining mould
amphinomus and wines that laugh in gold
and oh  may heaven display
a beam of glory oer thy future day
alas the brave too oft is doomd to bear
the gripes of poverty and stings of care

to whom with thought mature the king replies
the tongue speaks wisely when the soul is wise
such was thy father in imperial state
great without vice that oft attends the great
nor from the sire art thou the son declind
then hear my words and grace them in thy mind
of all that breathes or grovelling creeps on earth
most vain is man calamitous by birth
today with power elate in strength he blooms
the haughty creature on that power presumes
anon from heaven a sad reverse he feels
untaught to bear gainst heaven the wretch rebels
for man is changeful as his bliss or woe
too high when prosperous when distressd too low
there was a day when with the scornful great
i swelld in pomp and arrogance of state
proud of the power that to high birth belongs
and used that power to justify my wrongs
then let not man be proud but firm of mind
bear the best humbly and the worst resignd
be dumb when heaven afflicts unlike yon train
of haughty spoilers insolently vain
who make their queen and all her wealth a prey
but vengeance and ulysses wing their way
o mayst thou favourd by some guardian power
far far be distant in that deathful hour
for sure i am if stern ulysses breathe
these lawless riots end in blood and death

then to the gods the rosy juice he pours
and the draind goblet to the chief restores
stung to the soul oercast with holy dread
he shook the graceful honours of his head
his boding mind the future woe forestalls
in vain by great telemachus he falls
for pallas seals his doom all sad he turns
to join the peers resumes his throne and mourns

meanwhile minerva with instinctive fires
thy soul penelope from heaven inspires
with flattering hopes the suitors to betray
and seem to meet yet fly the bridal day
thy husbands wonder and thy sons to raise
and crown the mother and the wife with praise
then while the streaming sorrow dims her eyes
thus with a transient smile the matron cries

eurynome to go where riot reigns
i feel an impulse though my soul disdains
to my loved son the snares of death to show
and in the traitor friend unmask the foe
who smooth of tongue in purpose insincere
hides fraud in smiles while death is ambushd there

go warn thy son nor be the warning vain

but bathed anointed and adornd descend
powerful of charms bid every grace attend
the tide of flowing tears awhile suppress
tears but indulge the sorrow not repress
some joy remains to thee a son is given
such as in fondness parents ask of heaven

ah me forbear returns the queen forbear
oh talk not talk not of vain beautys care
no more i bathe since he no longer sees
those charms for whom alone i wish to please
the day that bore ulysses from this coast
blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast
but instant bid autonoe descend
instant hippodame our steps attend
ill suits it female virtue to be seen
alone indecent in the walks of men

then while eurynome the mandate bears
from heaven minerva shoots with guardian cares
oer all her senses as the couch she pressd
she pours a pleasing deep and deathlike rest
with every beauty every feature arms
bids her cheeks glow and lights up all her charms
in her lovedarting eyes awakes the fires

from limb to limb an air majestic sheds
and the pure ivory oer her bosom spreads
such venus shines when with a measured bound
she smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round
when with the graces in the dance she moves
and fires the gazing gods with ardent loves

then to the skies her flight minerva bends
and to the queen the damsel train descends
waked at their steps her flowing eyes unclose
the tears she wipes and thus renews her woes
howeer tis well that sleep awhile can free
with soft forgetfulness a wretch like me
oh were it given to yield this transient breath
send o diana send the sleep of death
why must i waste a tedious life in tears
nor bury in the silent grave my cares
o my ulysses ever honourd name
for thee i mourn till death dissolves my frame

thus wailing slow and sadly she descends
on either band a damsel train attends
full where the dome its shining valves expands
radiant before the gazing peers she stands
a veil translucent oer her brow displayd
her beauty seems and only seems to shade
sudden she lightens in their dazzled eyes
and sudden flames in every bosom rise
they send their eager souls with every look
till silence thus the imperial matron broke

o why my son why now no more appears
that warmth of soul that urged thy younger years
thy riper days no growing worth impart
a man in stature still a boy in heart
thy wellknit frame unprofitably strong
speaks thee a hero from a hero sprung
but the just gods in vain those gifts bestow
o wise alone in form and grave in show
heavens could a stranger feel oppressions hand
beneath thy roof and couldst thou tamely stand
if thou the strangers righteous cause decline
his is the sufferance but the shame is thine

to whom with filial awe the prince returns
that generous soul with just resentment burns
yet taught by time my heart has learnd to glow
for others good and melt at others woe
but impotent those riots to repel
i bear their outrage though my soul rebel
helpless amid the snares of death i tread
and numbers leagued in impious union dread
but now no crime is theirs this wrong proceeds
from irus and the guilty irus bleeds
oh would to jove or her whose arms display
the shield of jove or him who rules the day
that yon proud suitors who licentious tread
these courts within these courts like irus bled
whose loose head tottering as with wine oppressd
obliquely drops and nodding knocks his breast
powerless to move his staggering feet deny
the coward wretch the privilege to fly

then to the queen eurymachus replies
o justly loved and not more fair than wise
should greece through all her hundred states survey
thy finishd charms all greece would own thy sway
in rival crowds contest the glorious prize
dispeopling realms to gaze upon thy eyes
o woman loveliest of the lovely kind
in body perfect and complete in mind

ah me  when from this shore
ulysses saild then beauty was no more
the gods decreed these eyes no more should keep
their wonted grace but only serve to weep
should he return whateer my beauties prove
my virtues last my brightest charm is love
now grief thou all art mine the gods oercast
my soul with woes that long ah long must last
too faithfully my heart retains the day
that sadly tore my royal lord away
he graspd my hand and o my spouse i leave
thy arms  perhaps to find a grave
fame speaks the trojans bold they boast the skill
to give the featherd arrow wings to kill
to dart the spear and guide the rushing car
with dreadful inroad through the walks of war
my sentence is gone forth and tis decreed
perhaps by righteous heaven that i must bleed
my father mother all i trust to three
to them to them transfer the love of me
but when my son grows man the royal sway
resign and happy be thy bridal day
such were his words and hymen now prepares
to light his torch and give me up to cares
the afflictive hand of wrathful jove to bear
a wretch the most complete that breathes the air
falln een below the rights to woman due
careless to please with insolence ye woo
the generous lovers studious to succeed
bid their whole herds and flocks in banquets bleed
by precious gifts the vow sincere display
you only you make her ye love your prey

wellpleased ulysses hears his queen deceive
the suitortrain and raise a thirst to give
false hopes she kindles but those hopes betray
and promise yet elude the bridal day

while yet she speaks the gay antinous cries
offspring of kings and more than woman wise
tis right tis mans prerogative to give
and custom bids thee without shame receive
yet never never from thy dome we move
till hymen lights the torch of spousal love

the peers despatchd their heralds to convey
the gifts of love with speed they take the way
a robe antinous gives of shining dyes
the varying hues in gay confusion rise
rich from the artists hand twelve clasps of gold
close to the lessening waist the vest infold
down from the swelling loins the vest unbound
floats in bright waves redundant oer the ground
a bracelet rich with gold with amber gay
that shot effulgence like the solar ray
eurymachus presents and earrings bright
with triple stars that cast a trembling light
pisander bears a necklace wrought with art
and every peer expressive of his heart
a gift bestows this done the queen ascends
and slow behind her damsel train attends

then to the dance they form the vocal strain
till hesperus leads forth the starry train
and now he raises as the daylight fades
his golden circlet in the deepening shades
three vases heapd with copious fires display
oer all the palace a fictitious day
from space to space the torch widebeaming burns
and sprightly damsels trim the rays by turns

to whom the king ill suits your sex to stay
alone with men ye modest maids away
go with the queen the spindle guide or cull
 the silver wool
be it my task the torches to supply
een till the morning lamp adorns the sky
een till the morning with unwearied care
sleepless i watch for i have learnd to bear

scornful they heard melantho fair and young

chiefly derides regardless of the cares
her queen endures polluted joys she shares
nocturnal with eurymachus with eyes
that speak disdain the wanton thus replies
oh whither wanders thy distemperd brain
thou bold intruder on a princely train
hence to the vagrants rendezvous repair
or shun in some black forge the midnight air
proceeds this boldness from a turn of soul
or flows licentious from the copious bowl
is it that vanquishd irus swells thy mind
a foe may meet thee of a braver kind
who shortening with a storm of blows thy stay
shall send thee howling all in blood away

to whom with frowns o impudent in wrong
thy lord shall curb that insolence of tongue
know to telemachus i tell the offence
the scourge the scourge shall lash thee into sense

with conscious shame they hear the stern rebuke
nor longer durst sustain the sovereign look

then to the servile task the monarch turns
his royal hands each torch refulgent burns
with added day meanwhile in museful mood
absorbd in thought on vengeance fixd he stood
and now the martial maid by deeper wrongs
to rouse ulysses points the suitors tongues
scornful of age to taunt the virtuous man
thoughtless and gay eurymachus began

hear me  confederates and friends
some god no doubt this stranger kindly sends
the shining baldness of his head survey
it aids our torchlight and reflects the ray

then to the king that levelld haughty troy
say if large hire can tempt thee to employ
those hands in work to tend the rural trade
to dress the walk and form the embowering shade
so food and raiment constant will i give
but idly thus thy soul prefers to live
and starve by strolling not by work to thrive

to whom incensed should we o prince engage
in rival tasks beneath the burning rage
of summer suns were both constraind to wield
foodless the scythe along the burdend field
or should we labour while the ploughshare wounds
with steers of equal strength the allotted grounds
beneath my labours how thy wondering eyes
might see the sable field at once arise
should jove dire war unloose with spear and shield
and nodding helm i tread the ensanguined field
fierce in the van then wouldst thou wouldst thousay
misname me glutton in that glorious day
no thy illjudging thoughts the brave disgrace
tis thou injurious art not i am base
proud to seem brave among a coward train
but now thou art not valorous but vain
god should the stern ulysses rise in might
these gates would seem too narrow for thy flight

while yet he speaks eurymachus replies
with indignation flashing from his eyes

slave i with justice might deserve the wrong
should i not punish that opprobrious tongue
irreverent to the great and uncontrolld
art thou from wine or innate folly bold
perhaps these outrages from irus flow
a worthless triumph oer a worthless foe

he said and with full force a footstool threw
whirld from his arm with erring rage it flew
ulysses cautious of the vengeful foe
stoops to the ground and disappoints the blow
not so a youth who deals the goblet round
full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound
dashd from his hand the sounding goblet flies
he shrieks he reels he falls and breathless lies
then wild uproar and clamour mount the sky
till mutual thus the peers indignant cry
oh had this stranger sunk to realms beneath
to the black realms of darkness and of death
ere yet he trod these shores to strife he draws
peer against peer and what the weighty cause
a vagabond for him the great destroy
in vile ignoble jars the feast of joy

to whom the stern telemachus uprose
gods what wild folly from the goblet flows
whence this unguarded openness of soul
but from the license of the copious bowl
or heaven delusion sends but hence away
force i forbear and without force obey

silent abashd they hear the stern rebuke
till thus amphinomus the silence broke

true are his words and he whom truth offends
not with telemachus but truth contends
let not the hand of violence invade
the reverend stranger or the spotless maid
retire we hence but crown with rosy wine
the flowing goblet to the powers divine
guard he his guest beneath whose roof he stands
this justice this the social rite demands

the peers assent the goblet mulius crownd
with purple juice and bore in order round
each peer successive his libation pours
to the blest gods who filld the ethereal bowers
then swilld with wine with noise the crowds obey
and rushing forth tumultuous reel away






consulting secret with the blueeyed maid
still in the dome divine ulysses stayd
revenge mature for act inflamed his breast
and thus the son the fervent sire addressd

instant convey those steely stores of war
to distant rooms disposed with secret care
the cause demanded by the suitortrain
to soothe their fears a specious reason feign
say since ulysses left his natal coast
obscene with smoke their beamy lustre lost
his arms deform the roof they wont adorn
from the glad walls inglorious lumber torn
suggest that jove the peaceful thought inspired
lest they by sight of swords to fury fired
dishonest wounds or violence of soul
defame the bridal feast and friendly bowl

the prince obedient to the sage command
to euryclea thus the female band
in their apartments keep secure the doors
these swarthy arms among the covert stores
are seemlier hid my thoughtless youth they blame
imbrownd with vapour of the smouldering flame

in happier hour 
tutourd by early woes grow early wise
inspect with sharpend sight and frugal care
your patrimonial wealth a prudent heir
but who the lighted taper will provide
 your toils to guide

without infringing hospitable right
this guest  shall bear the guiding light
i cheer no lazy vagrants with repast
they share the meal that earn it ere they taste

he said from female ken she straight secures
the purposed deed and guards the bolted doors
auxiliar to his son ulysses bears
the plumycrested helms and pointed spears
with shields indented deep in glorious wars
minerva viewless on her charge attends
and with her golden lamp his toil befriends
not such the sickly beams which unsincere
gild the gross vapour of this nether sphere
a present deity the prince confessd
and wrappd with ecstasy the sire addressd

what miracle thus dazzles with surprise
distinct in rows the radiant columns rise
the walls whereer my wondering sight i turn
and roofs amidst a blaze of glory burn
some visitant of pure ethereal race
with his bright presence deigns the dome to grace

be calm  to none impart
but oft revolve the vision in thy heart
celestials mantled in excess of light
can visit unapproachd by mortal sight
seek thou repose whilst here i sole remain
to explore the conduct of the female train
the pensive queen perchance desires to know
the series of my toils to soothe her woe

with tapers flaming day his train attends
his bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends
soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close
till on her eastern throne aurora glows

whilst forming plans of death ulysses stayd
in counsel secret with the martial maid
attendant nymphs in beauteous order wait
the queen descending from her bower of state
her cheeks the warmer blush of venus wear
chastend with coy dianas pensive air
an ivory seat with silver ringlets graced
by famed icmalius wrought the menials placed
with ivory silverd thick the footstool shone
oer which the panthers various hide was thrown
the sovereign seat with graceful air she pressd
to different tasks their toil the nymphs addressd
the golden goblets some and some restored
from stains of luxury the polishd board
these to remove the expiring embers came
while those with unctuous fir foment the flame

twas then melantho with imperious mien
renewd the attack incontinent of spleen
avaunt  offensive to my sight
deem not in ambush here to lurk by night
into the womanstate asquint to pry
a daydevourer and an evening spy
vagrant begone before this blazing brand
shall urgeand waved it hissing in her hand

the insulted hero rolls his wrathful eyes
and why so turbulent of soul 
can these lean shrivelld limbs unnerved with age
these poor but honest rags enkindle rage
in crowds we wear the badge of hungry fate
and beg degraded from superior state
constraind a rentcharge on the rich i live
reduced to crave the good i once could give
a palace wealth and slaves i late possessd
and all that makes the great be calld the blessd
my gate an emblem of my open soul
embraced the poor and dealt a bounteous dole
scorn not the sad reverse injurious maid
tis joves high will and be his will obeyd
nor think thyself exempt that rosy prime
must share the general doom of withering time
to some new channel soon the changeful tide
of royal grace the offended queen may guide
and her loved lord unplume thy towering pride
or were he dead tis wisdom to beware
sweet blooms the prince beneath apollos care
your deeds with quick impartial eye surveys
potent to punish what he cannot praise

her keen reproach had reachd the sovereigns ear
loquacious insolent  forbear
to thee the purpose of my soul i told
venial discourse unblamed with him to hold
the storied labours of my wandering lord
to soothe my grief he haply may record
yet him my guest thy venomd rage hath stung
thy head shall pay the forfeit of thy tongue
but thou on whom my palace cares depend
eurynome regard the strangerfriend
a seat soft spread with furry spoils prepare
duedistant for us both to speak and hear

the menial fair obeys with duteous haste
a seat adornd with furry spoils she placed
duedistant for discourse the hero sate
when thus the sovereign from her chair of state

reveal obsequious to my first demand
thy name thy lineage and thy natal land

he thus o queen whose farresounding fame
is bounded only by the starry frame
consummate pattern of imperial sway
whose pious rule a warlike race obey
in wavy gold thy summer vales are dressd
thy autumns bind with copious fruit oppressd
with flocks and herds each grassy plain is stored
and fish of every fin thy seas afford
their affluent joys the grateful realms confess
and bless the power that still delights to bless
gracious permit this prayer imperial dame
forbear to know my lineage or my name
urge not this breast to heave these eyes to weep
in sweet oblivion let my sorrows sleep
my woes awaked will violate your ear
and to this gay censorious train appear
a whiny vapour melting in a tear

their gifts the gods resumed 
exterior grace and energy of mind
when the dear partner of my nuptial joy
auxiliar troops combined to conquer troy
my lords protecting hand alone would raise
my drooping verdure and extend my praise
peers from the distant samian shore resort
here with dulichians joind besiege the court
zacynthus green with evershady groves
and ithaca presumptuous boast their loves
obtruding on my choice a second lord
they press the hymenaean rite abhorrd
misrule thus mingling with domestic cares
i live regardless of my state affairs
receive no strangerguest no poor relieve
but ever for my lord in secret grieve
this art instinct by some celestial power
i tried elusive of the bridal hour

ye peers  who press to gain a heart
where dead ulysses claims no future part
rebate your loves each rival suit suspend
till this funeral web my labours end
cease till to good laertes i bequeath
a pall of state the ornament of death
for when to fate he bows each grecian dame
with just reproach were licensed to defame
should he long honourd in supreme command
want the last duties of a daughters hand
the fiction pleased their loves i long elude
the night still ravelld what the day renewd
three years successful in my heart conceald
my ineffectual fraud the fourth reveald
befriended by my own domestic spies
the woof unwrought the suitortrain surprise
from nuptial rites they now no more recede
and fear forbids to falsify the brede
my anxious parents urge a speedy choice
and to their suffrage gain the filial voice
for rule mature telemachus deplores
his dome dishonourd and exhausted stores
but stranger as thy days seem full of fate
divide discourse in turn thy birth relate
thy port asserts thee of distinguishd race
no poor unfatherd product of disgrace

princess  renewd by your command
the dear remembrance of my native land
of secret grief unseals the fruitful source
fond tears repeat their longforgotten course
so pays the wretch whom fate constrains to roam
the dues of nature to his natal home
but inward on my soul let sorrow prey
your sovereign will my duty bids obey

crete awes the circling waves a fruitful soil
and ninety cities crown the seaborn isle
mixd with her genuine sons adopted names
in various tongues avow their various claims
cydonians dreadful with the bended yew
and bold pelasgi boast a natives due
the dorians plumed amid the files of war
her foodful glebe with fierce achaians share
cnossus her capital of high command
where sceptred minos with impartial hand
divided right each ninth revolving year
by jove received in council to confer
his son deucalion bore successive sway
his son who gave me first to view the day
the royal bed an elder issue blessd
idomeneus whom ilion fields attest
of matchless deeds untraind to martial toil
i lived inglorious in my native isle
studious of peace and æthon is my name
twas then to crete the great ulysses came
for elemental war and wintry jove
from maleas gusty cape his navy drove
to bright lucinas fane the shelfy coast
where loud amnisus in the deep is lost
his vessels moord 
the hero speeded to the cnossian court
ardent the partner of his arms to find
in leagues of long commutual friendship joind
vain hope ten suns had warmd the western strand
since my brave brother with his cretan band
had saild for troy but to the genial feast
my honourd roof received the royal guest
beeves for his train the cnossian peers assign
a public treat with jars of generous wine
twelve days while boreas vexd the aërial space
my hospitable dome he deignd to grace
and when the north had ceased the stormy roar
he wingd his voyage to the phrygian shore

thus the famd hero perfected in wiles
with fair similitude of truth beguiles
the queens attentive ear dissolved in woe
from her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow
as snows collected on the mountain freeze
when milder regions breathe a vernal breeze
the fleecy pile obeys the whispering gales
ends in a stream and murmurs through the vales
so melting with the pleasing tale he told
down her fair cheek the copious torrent rolld
she to her present lord laments him lost
and views that object which she wants the most
withering at heart to see the weeping fair
his eyes look stern and cast a gloomy stare
of horn the stiff relentless balls appear
or globes of iron fixd in either sphere
firm wisdom interdicts the softening tear
a speechless interval of grief ensues
till thus the queen the tender theme renews

stranger that eer thy hospitable roof
ulysses graced confirm by faithful proof
delineate to my view my warlike lord
his form his habit and his train record

tis hard  to bring to sudden sight
ideas that have wingd their distant flight
rare on the mind those images are traced
whose footsteps twenty winters have defaced
but what i can receivein ample mode
a robe of military purple flowd
oer all his frame illustrious on his breast
the doubleclasping gold the king confessd
in the rich woof a hound mosaic drawn
bore on full stretch and seized a dappled fawn
deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold
they pant and struggle in the moving gold
fine as a filmy web beneath it shone
a vest that dazzled like a cloudless sun
the female train who round him throngd to gaze
in silent wonder sighd unwilling praise
a sabre when the warrior pressd to part
i gave enamelld with vulcanian art
a mantle purpletinged and radiant vest
dimensiond equal to his size expressd
affection grateful to my honourd guest
a favourite herald in his train i knew
his visage solemn sad of sable hue
short woolly curls oerfleeced his bending head
oer which a promontory shoulder spread
eurybates in whose large soul alone
ulysses viewd an image of his own

his speech the tempest of her grief restored
in all he told she recognized her lord
but when the storm was spent in plenteous showers
a pause inspiriting her languishd powers
o thou  whom first inclement fate
made welcome to my hospitable gate
with all thy wants the name of poor shall end
henceforth live honourd my domestic friend
the vest much envied on your native coast
and regal robe with figured gold embossd
in happier hours my artful hand employd
when my loved lord this blissful bower enjoyd
the fall of troy erroneous and forlorn
doomd to survive and never to return

then he with pity touchd o royal dame
your everanxious mind and beauteous frame
from the devouring rage of grief reclaim
i not the fondness of your soul reprove
for such a lord who crownd your virgin love
with the dear blessing of a fair increase
himself adornd with more than mortal grace
yet while i speak the mighty woe suspend
truth forms my tale to pleasing truth attend
the royal object of your dearest care
breathes in no distant clime the vital air
in rich thesprotia and the nearer bound
of thessaly his name i heard renownd
without retinue to that friendly shore
welcomed with gifts of price a sumless store
his sacrilegious train who dared to prey
on herds devoted to the god of day
were doomd by jove and phœbus just decree
to perish in the rough trinacrian sea
to better fate the blameless chief ordaind
a floating fragment of the wreck regaind
and rode the storm till by the billows tossd
he landed on the fair phæacian coast
that race who emulate the life of gods
receive him joyous to their blessd abodes
large gifts confer a ready sail command
to speed his voyage to the grecian strand
but your wise lord 
his ithaca refused from favouring fate
till copious wealth might guard his regal state
phedon the fact affirmd whose sovereign sway
thesprotian tribes a duteous race obey
and bade the gods this added truth attest

that anchord in his port the vessels stand
to waft the hero to his natal land
i for dulichium urge the watery way
but first the ulyssean wealth survey
so rich the value of a store so vast
demands the pomp of centuries to waste
the darling object of your royal love
was journeyd thence to dodonean jove
by the sure precept of the sylvan shrine
to form the conduct of his great design
irresolute of soul his state to shroud
in dark disguise or come a king avowd
thus lives your lord nor longer doomd to roam
soon will he grace this dear paternal dome
by jove the source of good supreme in power
by the blessd genius of this friendly bower
i ratify my speech before the sun
his annual longitude of heaven shall run
when the pale empress of yon starry train
in the next month renews her faded wane
ulysses will assert his rightful reign

what thanks what boon  are due
when time shall prove the storied blessing true
my lords return should fate no more retard
envy shall sicken at thy vast reward
but my prophetic fears alas presage
the wounds of destinys relentless rage
i long must weep nor will ulysses come
with royal gifts to send you honourd home
your other task ye menial train forbear
now wash the stranger and the bed prepare
with splendid palls the downy fleece adorn
uprising early with the purple morn
his sinews shrunk with age and stiff with toil
in the warm bath foment with fragrant oil
then with telemachus the social feast
partaking free my soul invited guest
whoeer neglects to pay distinction due
the breach of hospitable right may rue
the vulgar of my sex i most exceed
in real fame when most humane my deed
and vainly to the praise of queen aspire
if stranger i permit that mean attire
beneath the feastful bower a narrow space
confines the circle of our destind race
tis ours with good the scanty round to grace
those who to cruel wrong their state abuse
dreaded in life the mutterd curse pursues
by death disrobed of all their savage powers
then licensed rage her hateful prey devours
but he whose inborn worth his acts commend
of gentle soul to human race a friend
the wretched he relieves diffuse his fame
and distant tongues extol the patronname

princess  in vain your bounties flow
on me confirmd and obstinate in woe
when my loved crete received my final view
and from my weeping eyes her cliffs withdrew
these tatterd weeds 
i chose the livery of a woful mind
nor will my heartcorroding care abate
with splendid palls and canopies of state
lowcouchd on earth the gift of sleep i scorn
and catch the glances of the waking morn
the delicacy of your courtly train
to wash a wretched wanderer would disdain
but if in tract of long experience tried
and sad similitude of woes allied
some wretch reluctant views aërial light
to her mean hand assign the friendly rite

pleased with his wise reply the queen rejoind
such gentle manners and so sage a mind
in all who graced this hospitable bower
i neer discerned before this social hour
such servant as your humble choice requires
to light received the lord of my desires
new from the birth and with a mothers hand
his tender bloom to manly growth sustaind
of matchless prudence and a duteous mind
though now to lifes extremest verge declined
of strength superior to the toil designd
rise euryclea with officious care
for the poor friend the cleansing bath prepare
this debt his correspondent fortunes claim
too like ulysses and perhaps the same
thus old with woes my fancy paints him now
for age untimely marks the careful brow

instant obsequious to the mild command
sad euryclea rose with trembling hand
she veils the torrent of her tearful eyes
and thus impassiond to herself replies

son of my love and monarch of my cares
what pangs for thee this wretched bosom bears
are thus by jove who constant beg his aid
with pious deed and pure devotion paid
he never dared defraud the sacred fane
of perfect hecatombs in order slain
there oft implored his tutelary power
long to protract the sad sepulchral hour
that formd for empire with paternal care
his realm might recognize an equal heir
o destined head the pious vows are lost
his god forgets him on a foreign coast
perhaps like thee poor guest in wanton pride
the rich insult him and the young deride
conscious of worth reviled thy generous mind
the friendly rite of purity declined
my will concurring with my queens command
accept the bath from this obsequious hand
a strong emotion shakes my anguishd breast
in thy whole form ulysses seems expressd
of all the wretched harboured on our coast
none imaged eer like thee my master lost

thus halfdiscoverd through the dark disguise
with cool composure feignd the chief replies
you join your suffrage to the public vote
the same you think have all beholders thought

he said replenishd from the purest springs
the laver straight with busy care she brings
in the deep vase that shone like burnishd gold
the boiling fluid temperates the cold
meantime revolving in his thoughtful mind
the scar with which his manly knee was signd
his face averting from the crackling blaze
his shoulders intercept the unfriendly rays
thus cautious in the obscure he hoped to fly
the curious search of eurycleas eye
cautious in vain nor ceased the dame to find
this scar with which his manly knee was signd

this on parnassus 
with glancing rage the tusky savage tore
attended by his brave maternal race
his grandsire sent him to the sylvan chase
autolycus the bold 
his course to ithaca this hero sped
when the first product of laertes bed
was now disclosed to birth the banquet ends
when euryclea from the queen descends
and to his fond embrace the babe commends
receive  your royal daughters son
and name the blessing that your prayers have won
then thus the hoary chief my victor arms
have awed the realms around with dire alarms
a sure memorial of my dreaded fame
the boy shall bear ulysses be his name
and when with filial love the youth shall come
to view his mothers soil my delphic dome
with gifts of price shall send him joyous home
lured with the promised boon when youthful prime
ended in man his mothers natal clime
ulysses sought with fond affection dear
amphiteas arms received the royal heir
her ancient lord an equal joy possessd
instant he bade prepare the genial feast
a steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled
whose stately growth five flowery summers fed
his sons divide and roast with artful care
the limbs then all the tasteful viands share
nor ceased discourse 
till phœbus wheeling to the western goal
resignd the skies and night involved the pole
their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppressd
sated they rose and all retired to rest

soon as the morn newrobed in purple light
pierced with her golden shafts the rear of night
ulysses and his brave maternal race
the young autolyci essay the chase
parnassus thick perplexd with horrid shades
with deepmouthd hounds the huntertroop invades
what time the sun from oceans peaceful stream
darts oer the lawn his horizontal beam
the pack impatient snuff the tainted gale
the thorny wilds the woodmen fierce assail
and foremost of the train his cornel spear
ulysses waved to rouse the savage war
deep in the rough recesses of the wood
a lofty copse the growth of ages stood
nor winters boreal blast nor thunderous shower
nor solar ray could pierce the shady bower
with witherd foliage strewd a heapy store
the warm pavilion of a dreadful boar
roused by the hounds and hunters mingling cries
the savage from his leafy shelter flies
with fiery glare his sanguine eyeballs shine
and bristles high impale his horrid chine
young ithacus advanced defies the foe
poising his lifted lance in act to throw
the savage renders vain the wound decreed
and springs impetuous with opponent speed
his tusks oblique he aimd the knee to gore
aslope they glanced the sinewy fibres tore
and bared the bone ulysses undismayd
soon with redoubled force the wound repaid
to the right shoulderjoint the spear applied
his further flank with streaming purple dyed
on earth he rushed with agonizing pain
with joy and vast surprise the applauding train
viewd his enormous bulk extended on the plain
with bandage firm ulysses knee they bound
then chanting mystic lays the closing wound
of sacred melody confessd the force
the tides of life regaind their azure course
then back they led the youth with loud acclaim
autolycus enamoured with his fame
confirmd the cure and from the delphic dome
with added gifts returnd him glorious home
he safe at ithaca with joy received
relates the chase and early praise achieved

deep oer his knee inseamd remaind the scar
which noted token of the woodland war
when euryclea found the ablution ceased
down droppd the leg from her slack hand released
the mingled fluids from the base redound
the vase reclining floats the floor around
smiles dewd with tears the pleasing strife expressd
of grief and joy alternate in her breast
her fluttering words in melting murmurs died
at length abruptmy sonmy kingshe cried
his neck with fond embrace infolding fast
full on the queen her raptured eye she cast
ardent to speak the monarch safe restored
but studious to conceal her royal lord
minerva fixd her mind on views remote
and from the present bliss abstracts her thought
his hand to eurycleas mouth applied
art thou foredoomd my pest 
thy milky founts my infant lips have draind
and have the fates thy babbling age ordaind
to violate the life thy youth sustaind
an exile have i told with weeping eyes
full twenty annual suns in distant skies
at length returnd some god inspires thy breast
to know thy king and here i stand confessd
this heavendiscoverd truth to thee consignd
reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind
else if the gods my vengeful arm sustain
and prostrate to my sword the suitortrain
with their lewd mates thy undistinguishd age
shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage

then thus rejoind the dame devoid of fear
what words my son have passed thy lips severe
deep in my soul the trust shall lodge secured
with ribs of steel and marble heart immured
when heaven auspicious to thy right avowd
shall prostrate to thy sword the suitorcrowd
the deeds ill blazon of the menial fair
the lewd to death devote the virtuous spare

thy aid avails me not 
my own experience shall their doom decide
a witnessjudge precludes a long appeal
suffice it then thy monarch to conceal

he said obsequious with redoubled pace
she to the fount conveys the exhausted vase
the bath renewd she ends the pleasing toil
with plenteous unction of ambrosial oil
adjusting to his limbs the tatterd vest
his former seat received the stranger guest
whom thus with pensive air the queen addressed

though night dissolving grief in grateful ease
your drooping eyes with soft impression seize
awhile reluctant to her pleasing force
suspend the restful hour with sweet discourse
the day 
my menials and domestic cares employ
and unattended by sincere repose
the night assists my everwakeful woes
when natures hushd beneath her brooding shade
my echoing griefs the starry vault invade
as when the months are clad in flowery green
sad philomel in bowery shades unseen
to vernal airs attunes her varied strains
and itylus sounds warbling oer the plains
young itylus his parents darling joy
whom chance misled the mother to destroy
now doomd a wakeful bird to wail the beauteous boy
so in nocturnal solitude forlorn
a sad variety of woes i mourn
my mind reflective in a thorny maze
devious from care to care incessant strays
now wavering doubt succeeds to long despair
shall i my virgin nuptial vow revere
and joining to my sons my menial train
partake his counsels and assist his reign
or since mature in manhood he deplores
his dome dishonourd and exhausted stores
shall i reluctant to his will accord
and from the peers select the noblest lord
so by my choice avowd at length decide
these wasteful lovedebates a mourning bride
a visionary thought ill now relate
illustrate if you know the shadowd fate

a team of twenty geese 
fed near the limpid lake with golden grain
amuse my pensive hours the bird of jove
fierce from his mountaineyrie downward drove
each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway
and back triumphant wingd his airy way
my pitying eyes effused a plenteous stream
to view their death thus imaged in a dream
with tender sympathy to soothe my soul
a troop of matrons fancyformd condole
but whilst with grief and rage my bosom burnd
sudden the tyrant of the skies returned
perchd on the battlements he thus began

o queen no vulgar vision of the sky
i come prophetic of approaching joy
view in this plumy form thy victorlord
the geese  by thee deplored
portend the suitors fated to my sword
this said the pleasing featherd omen ceased
when from the downy bands of sleep released
fast by the limpid lake my swanlike train
i found insatiate of the golden grain

the vision selfexplaind 
sincere reveals the sanction of the skies
ulysses speaks his own return decreed
and by his sword the suitors sure to bleed

hard is the task and rare 
impending destinies in dreams to find
immured within the silent bower of sleep
two portals firm the various phantoms keep
of ivory one whence flit to mock the brain
of winged lies a light fantastic train
the gate opposed pellucid valves adorn
and columns fair incased with polishd horn
where images of truth for passage wait
with visions manifest of future fate
not to this troop i fear that phantom soard
which spoke ulysses to this realm restored
delusive semblancebut my remnant life
heaven shall determine in a gameful strife
with that famed bow ulysses taught to bend
for me the rival archers shall contend
as on the listed field he used to place
six beams opposed to six in equal space
elanced afar by his unerring art
sure through six circlets flew the whizzing dart
so when the sun restores the purple day
their strength and skill the suitors shall assay
to him the spousal honour is decreed
who through the rings directs the featherd reed
torn from these walls 
on this poor breast no dawn of bliss shall beam
the pleasure past supplies a copious theme
for many a dreary thought and many a doleful dream

propose the sportive lot 
nor dread to name yourself the bowyers prize
ulysses will surprise the unfinishd game
avowd and falsify the suitors claim

to whom with grace serene the queen rejoind
in all thy speech what pleasing force i find
oer my suspended woe thy words prevail
i part reluctant from the pleasing tale
but heaven that knows what all terrestrials need
repose to night and toil to day decreed
grateful vicissitudes yet me withdrawn
wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn
establishd use enjoins to rest and joy
estranged since dear ulysses saild to troy
meantime instructed is the menial tribe
your couch to fashion as yourself prescribe

thus affable her bower the queen ascends
the sovereign step a beauteous train attends
there imaged to her soul ulysses rose
down her pale cheek newstreaming sorrow flows
till soft oblivious shade minerva spread
and oer her eyes ambrosial slumber shed







an ample hide devine ulysses spread
and formd of fleecy skins his humble bed

then oer the chief eurynome the chaste
with duteous care a downy carpet cast
with dire revenge his thoughtful bosom glows
and ruminating wrath he scorns repose

as thus paviliond in the porch he lay
scenes of lewd loves his wakeful eyes survey
whilst to nocturnal joys impure repair
with wanton glee the prostituted fair
his heart with rage this new dishonour stung
wavering his thoughts in dubious balance hung
or instant should he quench the guilty flame
with their own blood and intercept the shame
or to their lust indulge a last embrace
and let the peers consummate the disgrace
round his swoln heart the murmurous fury rolls
as oer her young the mothermastiff growls
and bays the stranger groom so wrath compressd
recoiling mutterd thunder in his breast
poor suffering heart  support the pain
of wounded honour and thy rage restrain
not fiercer woes thy fortitude could foil
when the brave partners of thy ten years toil
dire polypheme devourd i then was freed
by patient prudence from the death decreed

thus anchord safe on reasons peaceful coast
tempests of wrath his soul no longer tossd
restless his body rolls to rage resignd
as one who long with paleeyed famine pined
the savoury cates on glowing embers cast
incessant turns impatient for repast
ulysses so from side to sidedevolved
in selfdebate the suitors doom resolved
when in the form of mortal nymph arrayd
from heaven descends the joveborn martial maid
and hovering oer his head in view confessd
the goddess thus her favourite care addressd

o thou of mortals most inured to woes
why roll those eyes unfriended of repose
beneath thy palaceroof forget thy care
blessd in thy queen blessd in thy blooming heir
whom to the gods when suppliant fathers bow
they name the standard of their dearest vow

just is thy kind reproach 
deeds full of fate distract my various mind
in contemplation wrappd this hostile crew
what single arm hath prowess to subdue
or if by joves and thy auxiliar aid
theyre doomd to bleed o say celestial maid
where shall ulysses shun or how sustain
nations embattled to revenge the slain

oh impotence of faith 
if man on frail unknowing man relies
doubt you the gods lo pallas self descends
inspires thy counsels and thy toils attends
in me affianced fortify thy breast
though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest
my sure divinity shall bear the shield
and edge thy sword to reap the glorious field
now pay the debt to craving nature due
her faded powers with balmy rest renew
she ceased ambrosial slumbers seal his eyes
her care dissolves in visionary joys
the goddess pleased regains her natal skies

not so the queen the downy bands of sleep
by grief relaxd she waked again to weep
a gloomy pause ensued of dumb despair
then thus her fate invoked with fervent prayer

diana speed thy deathful ebon dart
and cure the pangs of this convulsive heart
snatch me ye whirlwinds far from human race
tossd through the void illimitable space
or if dismounted from the rapid cloud
me with his whelming wave let ocean shroud
so pandarus thy hopes three orphan fair
were doomd to wander through the devious air
thyself untimely and thy consort died
but four celestials both your cares supplied
venus in tender delicacy rears
with honey milk and wine their infant years
imperial juno to their youth assigned
a form majestic and sagacious mind
with shapely growth diana graced their bloom
and pallas taught the texture of the loom
but whilst to learn their lots in nuptial love
bright cytherea sought the bower of jove

wingd harpies snatch the unguarded charge away
and to the furies bore a grateful prey
be such my lot or thou diana speed
thy shaft and send me joyful to the dead
to seek my lord among the warrior train
ere second vows my bridal faith profane
when woes the waking sense alone assail
whilst night extends her soft oblivious veil
of other wretches care the torture ends
no truce the warfare of my heart suspends
the night renews the day distracting theme
and airy terrors sable every dream
the last alone a kind illusion wrought
and to my bed my loved ulysses brought
in manly bloom and each majestic grace
as when for troy he left my fond embrace
such raptures in my beating bosom rise
i deem it sure a vision of the skies

thus whilst aurora mounts her purple throne
in audible laments she breathes her moan
the sounds assault ulysses wakeful ear
misjudging of the cause a sudden fear
of his arrival known the chief alarms
he thinks the queen is rushing to his arms
upspringing from his couch with active haste
the fleece and carpet in the dome he placed

and thus the gods invoked with ardent prayer

jove and eternal thrones with heaven to friend
if the long series of my woes shall end
of human race now rising from repose
let one a blissful omen here disclose
and to confirm my faith propitious jove
vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above

whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows
the pitying god his guardian aid avows
loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds
with springing hope the heros heart rebounds
soon with consummate joy to crown his prayer
an omend voice invades his ravishd ear
beneath a pile that close the dome adjoind
twelve female slaves the gift of ceres grind
taskd for the royal board to bolt the bran
from the pure flour 
discharging to the day the labour due
now early to repose the rest withdrew
one maid unequal to the task assignd
still turnd the toilsome mill with anxious mind
and thus in bitterness of soul divined

father of gods and men whose thunders roll
oer the cerulean vault and shake the pole
whoeer from heaven has gaind this rare ostent

in this blest moment of accepted prayer
piteous regard a wretch consumed with care
instant o jove confound the suitortrain
for whom oertoild i grind the golden grain
far from this dome the lewd devourers cast
and be this festival decreed their last

big with their doom denounced in earth and sky
ulysses heart dilates with secret joy
meantime the menial train with unctious wood
heapd high the genial hearth vulcanian food
when early dressd advanced the royal heir
with manly grasp he waved a martial spear
a radiant sabre graced his purple zone
and on his foot the golden sandal shone
his steps impetuous to the portal pressd
and euryclea thus he there addressd

say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes
was care for due refection and repose
bestowd the strangerguest or waits he grieved
his age not honourd nor his wants relieved
promiscuous grace on all the queen confers

the wordy vagrant to the dole aspires
and modest worth with noble scorn retires

she thus o cease that everhonourd name
to blemish now it ill deserves your blame
a bowl of generous wine sufficed the guest
in vain the queen the night refection pressd
nor would he court repose in downy state
unblessd abandond to the rage of fate
a hide beneath the portico was spread
and fleecy skins composed an humble bed
a downy carpet cast with duteous care
secured him from the keen nocturnal air

his cornel javelin poised with regal port
to the sage greeks convened in themis court
forthissuing from the dome the prince repaird
two dogs of chase a lionhearted guard
behind him sourly stalked without delay
the dame divides the labour of the day
thus urging to the toil the menial train

what marks of luxury the marble stain
its wonted lustre let the floor regain
the seats with purple clothe in order due
and let the abstersive sponge the board renew
let some refresh the vases sullied mould
some bid the goblets boast their native gold
some to the spring with each a jar repair
and copious waters pure for bathing bear
dispatch for soon the suitors will essay
the lunar feastrites to the god of day

she said with duteous haste a bevy fair
of twenty virgins to the spring repair
with varied toils the rest adorn the dome
magnificent and blithe the suitors come
some wield the sounding axe the dodderd oaks
divide obedient to the forceful strokes
soon from the fount with each a brimming urn
 the maids return
three porkers for the feast all brawnychined
he brought the choicest of the tuskykind
in lodgments first secure his care he viewed
then to the king this friendly speech renewd
now say sincere my guest the suitortrain
still treat thy worth with lordly dull disdain
or speaks their deed a bounteous mind humane

some pitying god 
with vollied vengeance blast their towering pride
no conscious blush no sense of right restrains
the tides of lust that swell the boiling veins
from vice to vice their appetites are tossd
all cheaply sated at anothers cost

while thus the chief his woes indignant told
melanthius master of the bearded fold
the goodliest goats of all the royal herd
spontaneous to the suitors feast preferrd
two grooms assistant bore the victims bound
with quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound
and to the chief austere aloud began
the wretch unfriendly to the race of man

here vagrant still offensive to my lords
blows have more energy than airy words
these arguments ill use nor conscious shame
nor threats thy bold intrusion will reclaim
on this high feast the meanest vulgar boast
a plenteous board hence seek another host

rejoinder to the churl the king disdaind
but shook his head and rising wrath restraind

from cephalenia cross the surgy main
philaetius late arrived a faithful swain
a steer ungrateful to the bulls embrace
and goats he brought the pride of all their race
imported in a shallop not his own
the dome reechoed to the mingld moan
straight to the guardian of the bristly kind
he thus began benevolent of mind

what guest is he of such majestic air
his lineage and paternal clime declare
dim through the eclipse of fate the rays divine
of sovereign state with faded splendour shine
if monarchs by the gods are plunged in woe
to what abyss are we foredoomd to go
then affable he thus the chief addressd
whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he pressd

stranger may fate a milder aspect show
and spin thy future with a whiter clue
o jove for ever deaf to human cries
the tyrant not the father of the skies
unpiteous of the race thy will began
the fool of fate thy manufacture man
with penury contempt repulse and care
the galling load of life is doomd to bear
ulysses from his state a wanderer still
upbraids thy power thy wisdom or thy will
o monarch ever dearo man of woe
fresh flow my tears and shall for ever flow
like thee poor stranger guest denied his home
like thee in rags obscene decreed to roam
or haply perishd on some distant coast
in stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost
oh grateful for the good his bounty gave
ill grieve till sorrow sink me to the grave
his kind protecting hand my youth preferrd
the regent of his cephalenian herd
with vast increase beneath my care it spreads
a stately breed and blackens far the meads
constraind the choicest beeves i thence import
to cram these cormorants that crowd his court
who in partition seek his realm to share
nor human right nor wrath divine revere
since here resolved oppressive these reside
contending doubts my anxious heart divide
now to some foreign clime inclined to fly
and with the royal herd protection buy
then happier thoughts return the nodding scale
light mounts despair alternate hopes prevail
in opening prospects of ideal joy
my king returns the proud usurpers die

to whom the chief in thy capacious mind
since daring zeal with cool debate is joind
attend a deed already ripe in fate
attest o jove the truth i now relate
this sacred truth attest each genial power
who bless the board and guard this friendly bower
before thou quit the dome 
thy wish produced in act with pleased survey
thy wondering eyes shall view his rightful reign
by arms avowd ulysses shall regain
and to the shades devote the suitortrain

o jove supreme 
with deeds consummate soon the promised joys
these aged nerves with newborn vigour strung
in that blest cause should emulate the young
assents eumaeus to the prayer addressd
and equal ardours fire his loyal breast

meantime the suitors urge the princes fate
and deathful arts employ the dire debate
when in his airy tour the bird of jove
trussd with his sinewy pounce a trembling dove
sinister to their hope this omen eyed
amphinomus who thus presaging cried

the gods from force and fraud the prince defend
o peers the sanguinary scheme suspend
your future thought let sable fate employ
and give the present hour to genial joy

from council straight the assenting peerage ceased
and in the dome prepared the genial feast
disrobed their vests apart in order lay
then all with speed succinct the victims slay
with sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled
and the proud steer was on the marble spread
with fire prepared they deal the morsels round
wine rosybright the brimming goblets crownd
by sage eumaeus borne the purple tide
melanthius from an ample jar supplied
high canisters of bread philaetius placed
and eager all devour the rich repast
disposed apart ulysses shares the treat
a trivet table and ignobler seat
the prince appoints but to his sire assigns
the tasteful inwards and nectareous wines
partake my guest  without control
the social feast and drain the cheering bowl
dread not the railers laugh nor ruffians rage
no vulgar roof protects thy honourd age
this dome a refuge to thy wrongs shall be
from my great sire too soon devolved to me
your violence and scorn ye suitors cease
lest arms avenge the violated peace

awed by the prince so haughty brave and young
rage gnawd the lip amazement chaind the tongue
be patient peers 
the threats of vain imperious youth despise
would jove permit the meditated blow
that stream of eloquence should cease to flow

without reply vouchsafed antinous ceased
meanwhile the pomp of festival increased
by heralds rankd in marshalld order move
the city tribes to pleased apollos grove
beneath the verdure of which awful shade
the lunar hecatomb they grateful laid
partook the sacred feast and ritual honours paid
but the rich banquet in the dome prepared
 ulysses shared
observant of the princes high behest
his menial train attend the strangerguest
whom pallas with unpardoning fury fired
by lordly pride and keen reproach inspired
a samian peer more studious than the rest
of vice who teemd with many a deadborn jest
and urged for title to a consort queen
unnumberd acres arable and green
 this lord ulysses eyed
and thus burst out the imposthumate with pride

the sentence i propose ye peers attend
since due regard must wait the princes friend
let each a token of esteem bestow
this gift acquits the dear respect i owe
with which he nobly may discharge his seat
and pay the menials for a masters treat

he said and of the steer before him placed
that sinewy fragment at ulysses cast
where to the pasternbone by nerves combined
the wellhornd foot indissolubly joind
which whizzing high the wall unseemly signd
the chief indignant grins a ghastly smile
revenge and scorn within his bosom boil
when thus the prince with pious rage inflamed
had not the inglorious wound thy malice aimd
falln guiltless of the mark my certain spear
had made thee buy the brutal triumph dear
nor should thy sire a queen his daughter boast
the suitor now had vanishd in a ghost
no more ye lewd compeers with lawless power
invade my dome my herds and flocks devour
for genuine worth of age mature to know
my grape shall redden and my harvest grow
or if each others wrongs ye still support
with rapes and riot to profane my court
what single arm with numbers can contend
on me let all your lifted swords descend
and with my life such vile dishonours end

a long cessation of discourse ensued
by gentler agelaus thus renewd

a just reproof ye peers your rage restrain
from the protected guest and menial train
and prince to stop the source of future ill
assent yourself and gain the royal will
whilst hope prevaild to see your sire restored
of right the queen refused a second lord
but who so vain of faith so blind to fate
to think he still survives to claim the state
now press the sovereign dame with warm desire
to wed as wealth or worth her choice inspire
the lord selected to the nuptial joys
far hence will lead the longcontested prize
whilst in paternal pomp with plenty blessd
you reign of this imperial dome possessd

sage and serene telemachus replies
by him at whose behest the thunder flies
and by the name on earth i most revere
by great ulysses and his woes i swear

wheneer her choice the royal dame avows
my bridal gifts shall load the future spouse
but from this dome my parent queen to chase
from me ye gods avert such dire disgrace

but pallas clouds with intellectual gloom
the suitors souls insensate of their doom
a mirthful frenzy seized the fated crowd
the roofs resound with causeless laughter loud
floating in gore portentous to survey
in each discolourd vase the viands lay
then down each cheek the tears spontaneous flow
and sudden sighs precede approaching woe
in vision wrappd the hyperesian seer
uprose and thus divined the vengeance near

o race to death devote with stygian shade
each destind peer impending fates invade
with tears your wan distorted cheeks are drownd
with sanguine drops the walls are rubied round
thick swarms the spacious hall with howling ghosts
to people orcus and the burning coasts
nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll
but universal night usurps the pole

yet warnd in vain with laughter loud elate
the peers reproach the sure divine of fate
and thus eurymachus the dotards mind
to every sense is lost to reason blind
swift from the dome conduct the slave away
let him in open air behold the day

tax not 
of rage or folly my prophetic mind
no clouds of error dim the ethereal rays
her equal power each faithful sense obeys
unguided hence my trembling steps i bend
far hence before yon hovering deaths descend
lest the ripe harvest of revenge begun
i share the doom ye suitors cannot shun

this said to sage piraeus sped the seer
his honourd host a welcome inmate there
oer the protracted feast the suitors sit
and aim to wound the prince with pointless wit
cries one with scornful leer and mimic voice
thy charity we praise but not thy choice
why such profusion of indulgence shown
to this poor timorous toildetesting drone
that others feeds on planetary schemes
and pays his host with hideous noonday dreams
but prince for once at least believe a friend
to some sicilian mart these courtiers send
where if they yield their freight across the main
dear sell the slaves demand no greater gain

thus jovial they but nought the prince replies
full on his sire he rolld his ardent eyes
impatient straight to flesh his virginsword
from the wise chief he waits the deathful word
nigh in her bright alcove the pensive queen
to see the circle sate of all unseen
sated at length they rise and bid prepare
an everepast with equal cost and care
but vengeful pallas with preventing speed
a feast proportiond to their crimes decreed
a feast of death the feasters doomd to bleed







and pallas now to raise the rivals fires
with her own art penelope inspires
who now can bend ulysses bow and wing
the wellaimd arrow through the distant ring
shall end the strife and win the imperial dame
but discord and black death await the game

the prudent queen the lofty stair ascends
at distance due a virgintrain attends
a brazen key she held the handle turnd
with steel and polishd elephant adornd
swift to the inmost room she bent her way
where safe reposed the royal treasures lay
there shone high heapd the labourd brass and ore
and there the bow which great ulysses bore
and there the quiver where now guiltless slept
those winged deaths that many a matron wept

this gift long since when spartas shore he trod
on young ulysses iphitus bestowed
beneath orsilochus roof they met
one loss was private one a public debt
messenas state from ithaca detains
three hundred sheep and all the shepherd swains
and to the youthful prince to urge the laws
the king and elders trust their common cause
but iphitus employed on other cares
searchd the wide country for his wandering mares
and mules the strongest of the labouring kind
hapless to search more hapless still to find
for journeying on to hercules at length
that lawless wretch that man of brutal strength
deaf to heavens voice the social rites transgressd
and for the beauteous mares destroyd his guest
he gave the bow and on ulysses part
received a pointed sword and missile dart
of luckless friendship on a foreign shore
their first last pledges for they met no more
the bow bequeathd by this unhappy hand
ulysses bore not from his native land
nor in the front of battle taught to bend
but kept in dear memorial of his friend

now gently winding up the fair ascent
by many an easy step the matron went
then oer the pavement glides with grace divine

the folding gates a dazzling light displayd
with pomp of various architrave oerlaid
the bolt obedient to the silken string
forsakes the staple as she pulls the ring
the wards respondent to the key turn round
the bars fall back the flying valves resound
loud as a bull makes hill and valley ring
so roard the lock when it released the spring
she moves majestic through the wealthy room
where treasured garments cast a rich perfume
there from the column where aloft it hung
reachd in its splendid case the bow unstrung
across her knees she laid the wellknown bow
and pensive sate and tears began to flow
to full satiety of grief she mourns
then silent to the joyous hall returns
to the proud suitors bears in pensive state
the unbended bow and arrows winged with fate

behind her train the polishd coffer brings
which held the alternate brass and silver rings
full in the portal the chaste queen appears
and with her veil conceals the coming tears
on either side awaits a virgin fair
while thus the matron with majestic air

say you when these forbidden walls inclose
for whom my victims bleed my vintage flows
if these neglected faded charms can move
or is it but a vain pretence you love
if i the prize if me you seek to wife
hear the conditions and commence the strife
who first ulysses wondrous bow shall bend
and through twelve ringlets the fleet arrow send
him will i follow and forsake my home
for him forsake this loved this wealthy dome
long long the scene of all my past delight
and still to last the vision of my night

graceful she said and bade eumaeus show
the rival peers the ringlets and the bow
from his full eyes the tears unbidden spring
touchd at the dear memorials of his king
philaetius too relents but secret shed
the tender drops antinous saw and said

hence to your fields ye rustics hence away
nor stain with grief the pleasures of the day
nor to the royal heart recall in vain
the sad remembrance of a perishd man
enough her precious tears already flow
or share the feast with due respect or go
to weep abroad and leave to us the bow
no vulgar task ill suits this courtly crew
that stubborn horn which brave ulysses drew
i well remember  what majesty he bore
and still  retain
the port the strength the grandeur of the man

he said but in his soul fond joys arise
and his proud hopes already win the prize
to speed the flying shaft through every ring
wretch is not thine the arrows of the king
shall end those hopes and fate is on the wing

then thus telemachus some god i find
with pleasing frenzy has possessd my mind
when a loved mother threatens to depart
why with this illtimed gladness leaps my heart
come then ye suitors and dispute a prize
richer than all the achaian state supplies
than all proud argos or mycaena knows
than all our isles or continents inclose
a woman matchless and almost divine
fit for the praise of every tongue but mine
no more excuses then no more delay
haste to the triallo i lead the way

i too may try and if this arm can wing
the featherd arrow through the destined ring
then if no happier night the conquest boast
i shall not sorrow for a mother lost
but blessd in her possess those arms alone
heir of my fathers strength as well as throne

he spoke then rising his broad sword unbound
and cast his purple garment on the ground
a trench he opend in a line he placed
the level axes and the points made fast

then with a manly pace he took his stand
and graspd the bow and twangd it in his hand
three times with beating heart he made essay
three times unequal to the task gave way
a modest boldness on his cheek appeard
and thrice he hoped and thrice again he feard
the fourth had drawn it the great sire with joy
beheld but with a sign forbade the boy
his ardour straight the obedient prince suppressd
and artful thus the suitortrain addressd

o lay the cause on youth yet immature

how shall this arm unequal to the bow
retort an insult or repel a foe
but you whom heaven with better nerves has blessd
accept the trial and the prize contest

he cast the bow before him and apart
against the polishd quiver proppd the dart
resuming then his seat eupithes son
the bold antinous to the rest begun
from where the goblet first begins to flow
from right to left in order take the bow
and prove your several strengths the princes heard
and first leiodes blameless priest appeard
the eldest born of œnops noble race
who next the goblet held his holy place
he only he of all the suitor throng
their deeds detested and abjured the wrong
with tender hands the stubborn horn he strains
the stubborn horn resisted all his pains
already in despair he gives it oer
take it who will  i strive no more
what numerous deaths attend this fatal bow
what souls and spirits shall it send below
better indeed to die and fairly give
nature her debt than disappointed live
with each new sun to some new hope a prey
yet still tomorrow falser than today
how long in vain penelope we sought
this bow shall ease us of that idle thought
and send us with some humbler wife to live
whom gold shall gain or destiny shall give

thus speaking on the floor the bow he placed

at distance far the featherd shaft he throws
and to the seat returns from whence he rose

to him antinous thus with fury said
what words illomend from thy lips have fled
thy cowardfunction ever is in fear
those arms are dreadful which thou canst not bear
why should this bow be fatal to the brave
because the priest is born a peaceful slave
mark then what others can he ended there
and bade melanthius a vast pile prepare
he gives it instant flame then fast beside
spreads oer an ample board a bullocks hide
with melted lard they soak the weapon oer
chafe every knot and supple every pore
vain all their art and all their strength as vain
the bow inflexible resists their pain
the force of great eurymachus alone
and bold antinous yet untired unknown
those only now remaind but those confessd
of all the train the mightiest and the best

then from the hall and from the noisy crew
the masters of the herd and flock withdrew
the king observes them he the hall forsakes
and past the limits of the court oertakes
then thus with accent mild ulysses spoke
ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock
shall i the secret of my breast conceal
or  shall i tell
say should some favouring god restore again
the lost ulysses to his native reign
how beat your hearts what aid would you afford
to the proud suitors or your ancient lord

philaetius thus o were thy word not vain
would mighty jove restore that man again
these aged sinews with new vigour strung
in his blest cause should emulate the young
with equal vows eumaeus too implored
each power above with wishes for his lord

he saw their secret souls and thus began
those vows the gods accord behold the man
your own ulysses twice ten years detaind
by woes and wanderings from this hapless land
at length he comes but comes despised unknown
and finding faithful you and you alone
all else have cast him from their very thought
een in their wishes and their prayers forgot
hear then my friends if jove this arm succeed
and give yon impious revellers to bleed
my care shall be to bless your future lives
with large possessions and with faithful wives
fast by my palace shall your domes ascend
and each on young telemachus attend
and each be calld his brother and my friend
to give you firmer faith now trust your eye
lo the broad scar indented on my thigh
when with autolycus sons of yore
on parnass top i chased the tusky boar
his ragged vest then drawn aside disclosed
the sign conspicuous and the scar exposed
eager they viewd with joy they stood amazed
with tearful eyes oer all their master gazed
around his neck their longing arms they cast
his head his shoulders and his knees embraced
tears followed tears no word was in their power
in solemn silence fell the kindly shower
the king too weeps the king too grasps their hands
and moveless as a marble fountain stands

thus had their joy wept down the setting sun
but first the wise man ceased and thus begun
enoughon other cares your thought employ
for danger waits on all untimely joy
full many foes and fierce observe us near
some may betray and yonder walls may hear
reenter then not all at once but stay
some moments you and let me lead the way
to me neglected as i am i know
the haughty suitors will deny the bow
but thou eumaeus as tis borne away
thy masters weapon to his hand convey
at every portal let some matron wait
and each lock fast the wellcompacted gate
close let them keep whateer invades their ear
though arms or shouts or dying groans they hear
to thy strict charge philaetius we consign
the courts main gate to guard that pass be thine

this said he first returnd the faithful swains
at distance follow as their king ordains
before the flame eurymachus now stands
and turns the bow and chafes it with his hands
still the tough bow unmoved the lofty man
sighd from his mighty soul and thus began

i mourn the common cause for oh my friends
on me on all what grief what shame attends
not the lost nuptials can affect me more

but baffled thus confessd so far below
ulysses strength as not to bend his bow
how shall all ages our attempt deride
our weakness scorn antinous thus replied

not so eurymachus that no man draws
the wondrous bow attend another cause
sacred to phœbus is the solemn day
which thoughtless we in games would waste away
till the next dawn this illtimed strife forego
and here leave fixed the ringlets in a row
now bid the sewer approach and let us join
in due libations and in rites divine
so end our night before the day shall spring
the choicest offerings let melanthius bring
let then to phœbus name the fatted thighs
feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies
so shall the patron of these arts bestow
 the skill to bend the bow

they heard well pleased the ready heralds bring
the cleansing waters from the limpid spring
the goblet high with rosy wine they crownd
in order circling to the peers around
that rite complete uprose the thoughtful man
and thus his meditated scheme began

if what i ask your noble minds approve
ye peers and rivals in the royal love
chief if it hurt not great antinous ear

and if eurymachus the motion please
give heaven this day and rest the bow in peace
tomorrow let your arms dispute the prize
and take it he the favourd of the skies
but since till then this trial you delay
trust it one moment to my hands today
fain would i prove before your judging eyes
what once i was whom wretched you despise
if yet this arm its ancient force retain
or if my woes 
and wants and insults make me less than man

rage flashd in lightning from the suitors eyes
yet mixed with terror at the bold emprise
antinous then o miserable guest
is common sense quite banishd from thy breast
sufficed it not within the palace placed
to sit distinguishd with our presence graced
admitted here with princes to confer
a man unknown a needy wanderer
to copious wine this insolence we owe
and much thy betters wine can overthrow
the great eurytion when this frenzy stung
pirithous roofs with frantic riot rung
boundless the centaur raged till one and all
the heroes rose and draggd him from the hall
his nose they shortend and his ears they slit
and sent him soberd home with better wit
hence with long war the double race was cursed
fatal to all but to the aggressor first
such fate i prophesy our guest attends
if here this interdicted bow he bends
nor shall these walls such insolence contain
the first fair wind transports him oer the main
where echetus to death the guilty brings

better than that if thou approve our cheer
cease the mad strife and share our bounty here

to this the queen her just dislike expressd

tis impious prince to harm the strangerguest
base to insult who bears a suppliants name
and some respect telemachus may claim
what if the immortals on the man bestow
sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow
shall i a queen by rival chiefs adored
accept a wandering stranger for my lord
a hope so idle never touchd his brain
then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain
far be he banishd from this stately scene
who wrongs his princess with a thought so mean

o fair and wisest of so fair a kind

moved by no weak surmise but sense of shame
we dread the allarraigning voice of fame
we dread the censure of the meanest slave
the weakest woman all can wrong the brave
behold what wretches to the bed pretend
of that brave chief whose bow they could not bend
in came a beggar of the strolling crew
and did what all those princes could not do
thus will the common voice our deed defame
and thus posterity upbraid our name

to whom the queen if fame engage your views
forbear those acts which infamy pursues
wrong and oppression no renown can raise
know friend that virtue is the path to praise
the stature of our guest his port his face
speak him descended from no vulgar race
to him the bow as he desires convey
and to his hand if phœbus give the day
hence to reward his merit be shall bear
a twoedged falchion and a shining spear
embroiderd sandals a rich cloak and vest
a safe conveyance to his port of rest

o royal mother everhonourd name
permit me  to claim
a sons just right no grecian prince but i
has power this bow to grant or to deny
of all that ithacas rough hills contain
and all wide elis courserbreeding plain
to me alone my fathers arms descend
and mine alone they are to give or lend
retire o queen thy household task resume
tend with thy maids the labours of thy loom
the bow the darts and arms of chivalry
these cares to man belong and most to me

mature beyond his years the queen admired
his sage reply and with her train retired
there in her chamber as she sate apart
revolved his words and placed them in her heart
on her ulysses then she fixd her soul
down her fair cheek the tears abundant roll
till gentle pallas piteous of her cries
in slumber closed her silverstreaming eyes

now through the press the bow eumaeus bore
and all was riot noise and wild uproar
hold lawless rustic whither wilt thou go
to whom insensate dost thou bear the bow
exiled for this to some sequesterd den
far from the sweet society of men
to thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made
if heaven and phœbus lend the suitors aid
thus they aghast he laid the weapon down
but bold telemachus thus urged him on
proceed false slave and slight their empty words
what hopes the fool to please so many lords
young as i am thy princes vengeful hand
stretchd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land
oh could the vigour of this arm as well
the oppressive suitors from my walls expel
then what a shoal of lawless men should go
to fill with tumult the dark courts below

the suitors with a scornful smile survey
the youth indulging in the genial day
eumaeus thus encouraged hastes to bring
the strifeful bow and gives it to the king
old euryclea calling then aside
hear what telemachus enjoins 
at every portal let some matron wait
and each lock fast the wellcompacted gate
and if unusual sounds invade their ear
if arms or shouts or dying groans they hear
let none to call or issue forth presume
but close attend the labours of the loom

her prompt obedience on his order waits
closed in an instant were the palace gates
in the same moment forth philaetius flies
secures the court and with a cable ties
the utmost gate 
then unperceived and silent at the board
his seat he takes his eyes upon his lord

and now his wellknown bow the master bore
turnd on all sides and viewd it oer and oer
lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong
its owner absent and untried so long
while some deridinghow he turns the bow
some other like it sure the man must know
or else would copy or in bows he deals
perhaps he makes them or perhaps he steals
heaven to this wretch  be kind
and bless in all to which he stands inclined
with such good fortune as he now shall find

heedless he heard them but disdaind reply
the bow perusing with exactest eye
then as some heavenly minstrel taught to sing
high notes responsive to the trembling string
to some new strain when he adapts the lyre
or the dumb lute refits with vocal wire
relaxes strains and draws them to and fro
so the great master drew the mighty bow
and drew with ease one hand aloft displayd
the bending horns and one the string essayd
from his essaying hand the string let fly
twangd short and sharp like the shrill swallows cry
a general horror ran through all the race
sunk was each heart and pale was every face
signs from above ensued the unfolding sky
in lightning burst jove thunderd from on high
fired at the call of heavens almighty lord
he snatchd the shaft that glitterd on the board


now sitting as he was the cord he drew
through every ringlet levelling his view
then notchd the shaft released and gave it wing
the whizzing arrow vanished from the string
sung on direct and threaded every ring
the solid gate its fury scarcely bounds
pierced through and through the solid gate resounds
then to the prince nor have i wrought thee shame
nor errd this hand unfaithful to its aim
nor provd the toil too hard nor have i lost
that ancient vigour once my pride and boast
ill i deserved these haughty peers disdain
now let them comfort their dejected train
in sweet repast their present hour employ
nor wait till evening for the genial joy
then to the lutes soft voice prolong the night
music the banquets most refined delight

he said then gave a nod and at the word
telemachus girds on his shining sword
fast by his fathers side he takes his stand
the beamy javelin lightens in his hand







then fierce the hero oer the threshold strode
strippd of his rags he blazed out like a god
full in their face the lifted bow he bore
and quiverd deaths a formidable store
before his feet the rattling shower he threw
and thus terrific to the suitorcrew

one venturous game this hand hath won today
another princes yet remains to play
another mark our arrow must attain
phœbus assist nor be the labour vain
swift as the word the parting arrow sings
and bears thy fate antinous on its wings
wretch that he was of unprophetic soul
high in his hands he reard the golden bowl
een then to drain it lengthend out his breath
changed to the deep the bitter draught of death
for fate who feard amidst a feastful band
and fate to numbers by a single hand
full through his throat ulysses weapon passd
and pierced his neck he falls and breathes his last
the tumbling goblet the wide floor oerflows
a stream of gore burst spouting from his nose
grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls
before him spurnd the loaded table falls
and spreads the pavement with a mingled flood
of floating meats and wine and human blood
amazed confounded as they saw him fall
up rose the throngs tumultuous round the hall
oer all the dome they cast a haggard eye
each lookd for armsin vain no arms were nigh
aimst thou at princes 
thy last of games unhappy hast thou playd
thy erring shaft has made our bravest bleed
and death unlucky guest attends thy deed
vultures shall tear thee thus incensed they spoke
while each to chance ascribed the wondrous stroke
blind as they were for death een now invades
his destined prey and wraps them all in shades
then grimly frowning with a dreadful look
that witherd all their hearts ulysses spoke

dogs ye have had your day ye feard no more
ulysses vengeful from the trojan shore
while to your lust and spoil a guardless prey
our house our wealth our helpless handmaids lay
not so content with bolder frenzy fired
een to our bed presumptuous you aspired
laws or divine or human faild to move
or shame of men or dread of gods above
heedless alike of infamy or praise
or fames eternal voice in future days
the hour of vengeance wretches now is come
impending fate is yours and instant doom

thus dreadful he confused the suitors stood
from their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood
trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide
alone the bold eurymachus replied

if as thy words import 
ulysses lives and thou the mighty man
great are thy wrongs and much hast thou sustaind
in thy spoild palace and exhausted land
the cause and author of those guilty deeds
lo at thy feet unjust antinous bleeds
not love but wild ambition was his guide
to slay thy son thy kingdom to divide
these were his aims but juster jove denied
since cold in death the offender lies oh spare
thy suppliant people and receive their prayer
brass gold and treasures shall the spoil defray
two hundred oxen every prince shall pay
the waste of years refunded in a day
till then thy wrath is just ulysses burnd
with high disdain and sternly thus returnd

all all the treasure that enrichd our throne
before your rapines joind with all your own
if offerd vainly should for mercy call
tis you that offer and i scorn them all
your blood is my demand your lives the prize
till pale as yonder wretch each suitor lies
hence with those coward terms or fight or fly
this choice is left you to resist or die
and die i trust ye shall he sternly spoke
with guilty fears the pale assembly shook
alone eurymachus exhorts the train
yon archer comrades will not shoot in vain
but from the threshold shall his darts be sped
 till every prince lie dead
be mindful of yourselves draw forth your swords
and to his shafts obtend these ample boards
 then all united strive
the bold invader from his post to drive
the city roused shall to our rescue haste
and this mad archer soon have shot his last

swift as he spoke he drew his traitor sword
and like a lion rushd against his lord
the wary chief the rushing foe repressd
who met the point and forced it in his breast
his falling hand deserts the lifted sword
and prone he falls extended oer the board
before him wide in mixd effusion roll
the untasted viands and the jovial bowl
full through his liver passd the mortal wound
with dying rage his forehead beats the ground
he spurnd the seat with fury as he fell
and the fierce soul to darkness dived and hell
next bold amphinomus his arm extends
to force the pass the godlike man defends
thy spear telemachus prevents the attack
the brazen weapon driving through his back
thence through his breast its bloody passage tore
flat falls he thundering on the marble floor
and his crushd forehead marks the stone with gore
he left his javelin in the dead for fear
the long encumbrance of the weighty spear
to the fierce foe advantage might afford
to rush between and use the shortend sword
with speedy ardour to his sire he flies
and arm great father arm 
lo hence i run for other arms to wield
for missive javelins and for helm and shield
fast by our side let either faithful swain
in arms attend us and their part sustain

haste and return 
while yet the auxiliar shafts this hand supply
lest thus alone encounterd by an host
driven from the gate the important past be lost

with speed telemachus obeys and flies
where piled in heaps the royal armour lies
four brazen helmets eight refulgent spears
and four broad bucklers to his sire he bears
at once in brazen panoply they shone
at once each servant braced his armour on
around their king a faithful guard they stand
while yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand
chief after chief expired at every wound
and swelld the bleeding mountain on the ground
soon as his store of flying fates was spent
against the wall he set the bow unbent
and now his shoulders bear the massy shield
and now his hands two beamy javelins wield
he frowns beneath his nodding plume that playd
oer the high crest and cast a dreadful shade

there stood a window near whence looking down
from oer the porch appeard the subject town
a double strength of valves secured the place
a high and narrow but the only pass
the cautious king with allpreventing care
to guard that outlet placed eumaeus there
when agelaus thus has none the sense
to mount yon window and alarm from thence
the neighbourtown the town shall force the door
and this bold archer soon shall shoot no more
melanthius then that outlet to the gate
so near adjoins that one may guard the strait
but other methods of defence remain
myself with arms can furnish all the train
stores from the royal magazine i bring
and their own darts shall pierce the prince and king

he said and mounting up the lofty stairs
twelve shields twelve lances and twelve helmets bears
all arm and sudden round the hall appears
a blaze of bucklers and a wood of spears

the hero stands oppressd with mighty woe
on every side he sees the labour grow
oh cursed event and oh unlookd for aid
melanthius or the women have betrayd
oh my dear sonthe father with a sigh
then ceased the filial virtue made reply

falsehood is folly and tis just to own
the fault committed this was mine alone
my haste neglected yonder door to bar
and hence the villain has supplied their war
run good eumaeus then and  well secure that door
learn if by female fraud this deed were done
or  by dolius son

while yet they spoke in quest of arms again
to the high chamber stole the faithless swain
not unobserved eumaeus watchful eyed
and thus addressd ulysses near his side

the miscreant we suspected takes that way
him if this arm be powerful shall i slay
or drive him hither to receive the meed
from thy own hand of this detested deed

not so  leave him there
for us sufficient is another care
within the structure of this palace wall
to keep enclosed his masters till they fall
go you and seize the felon backward bind
his arms and legs and fix a plank behind
on this his body by strong cords extend
and on a column near the roof suspend
so studied tortures his vile days shall end

the ready swains obeyd with joyful haste
behind the felon unperceived they passd
as round the room in quest of arms he goes

one hand sustaind a helm and one the shield
which old laertes wont in youth to wield
coverd with dust with dryness chappd and worn
the brass corroded and the leather torn
thus laden oer the threshold as he steppd
fierce on the villain from each side they leapd
back by the hair the trembling dastard drew
and down reluctant on the pavement threw
active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil
at every point their masters rigid will
first fast behind his hands and feet they bound
then straightend cords involved his body round
so drawn aloft athwart the column tied
the howling felon swung from side to side

eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain
there pass thy pleasing night o gentle swain
on that soft pillow from that envied height
first mayst thou see the springing dawn of light
so timely rise when morning streaks the east
to drive thy victims to the suitors feast

this said they left him tortured as he lay
secured the door and hasty strode away
each breathing death resumed his dangerous post
near great ulysses four against an host
when lo descending to her heros aid
joves daughter pallas wars triumphant maid
in mentors friendly form she joind his side
ulysses saw and thus with transport cried

come ever welcome and thy succour lend
o every sacred name in one my friend
early we loved and long our loves have grown
whateer through lifes whole series i have done
or good or grateful now to mind recall
and aiding this one hour repay it all

thus he but pleasing hopes his bosom warm
of pallas latent in the friendly form
the adverse host the phantomwarrior eyed
and first loudthreatening agelaus cried

mentor beware nor let that tongue persuade
thy frantic arm to lend ulysses aid
our force successful shall our threat make good
and with the sire and son commix thy blood
what hopest thou here thee first the sword shall slay
then lop thy whole posterity away
far hence thy banishd consort shall we send
with his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend
thus and thus only shalt thou join thy friend

his barbarous insult even the goddess fires
who thus the warrior to revenge inspires

art thou ulysses where then shall we find
the patient body and the constant mind
that courage once the trojans daily dread
known nine long years and felt by heroes dead
and where that conduct which revenged the lust
of priams race and laid proud troy in dust
if this when helen was the cause were done
what for thy country now thy queen thy son
rise then in combat at my side attend
observe what vigour gratitude can lend
and foes how weak opposed against a friend

she spoke but willing longer to survey
the sire and sons great acts withheld the day
by farther toils decreed the brave to try
and level poised the wings of victory
then with a change of form eludes their sight
perchd like a swallow on a rafters height
and unperceived enjoys the rising fight

damastors son bold agelaus leads
the guilty war eurynomus succeeds
with these pisander great polyctors son
sage polybus and stern amphimedon
with demoptolemus these six survive
the best of all the shafts had left alive
amidst the carnage desperate as they stand
thus agelaus roused the lagging band

the hour has come when yon fierce man no more
with bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor
lo mentor leaves him with an empty boast
the four remain but four against an host
let each at once discharge the deadly dart
one sure of six shall reach ulysses heart
the rest must perish their great leader slain
thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain

then all at once their mingled lances threw
and thirsty all of one mans blood they flew
in vain minerva turned them with her breath
and scattered short or wide the points of death
with deadend sound one on the threshold falls
one strikes the gate one rings against the walls
the storm passed innocent the godlike man
now loftier trod and dreadful thus began
tis now  our turn at once to throw
 our javelins at the foe
that impious race to all their past misdeeds
would add our blood injustice still proceeds

he spoke at once their fiery lances flew
great demoptolemus ulysses slew
euryades received the princes dart
the goatherds quiverd in pisanders heart
fierce elatus by thine eumaeus falls
their fall in thunder echoes round the walls
the rest retreat the victors now advance
each from the dead resumes his bloody lance
again the foe discharge the steely shower
again made frustrate by the virginpower
some turnd by pallas on the threshold fall
some wound the gate some ring against the wall
some weak or ponderous with the brazen head
drop harmless on the pavement sounding dead

then bold amphimedon his javelin cast
thy hand telemachus it lightly razed
and from ctesippus arm the spear elanced
on good eumaeus shield and shoulder glanced
not lessened of their force 
each sung along and dropped upon the ground
fate doomd thee next eurydamus to bear
thy death ennobled by ulysses spear
by the bold son amphimedon was slain
and polybus renownd the faithful swain
pierced through the breast the rude ctesippus bled
and thus philaetius gloried oer the dead

there end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain
o sharp in scandal voluble and vain
how weak is mortal pride to heaven alone
the event of actions and our fates are known
scoffer behold what gratitude we bear
the victims heel is answered with this spear

ulysses brandishd high his vengeful steel
and damastorides that instant fell
fast by leocritus expiring lay
the princes javelin tore its bloody way
through all his bowels down he tumbled prone
his batterd front and brains besmear the stone

now pallas shines confessd aloft she spreads
the arm of vengeance oer their guilty heads
the dreadful aegis blazes in their eye
amazed they see they tremble and they fly
confused distracted through the rooms they fling
like oxen maddend by the breezes sting
when sultry days and long succeed the gentle spring
not half so keen fierce vultures of the chase
stoop from the mountains on the featherd race
when the wide field extended snares beset
with conscious dread they shun the quivering net
no help no flight but wounded every way
headlong they drop the fowlers seize their prey
on all sides thus they double wound on wound
in prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground
unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan
and a red deluge floats the reeking stone

leiodes first before the victor falls
the wretched augur thus for mercy calls
oh gracious hear nor let thy suppliant bleed
still undishonoured or by word or deed
thy house for me remains by me repressd
full oft was checkd the injustice of the rest
averse they heard me when i counselled well
their hearts were hardend and they justly fell
o spare an augurs consecrated head
nor add the blameless to the guilty dead

priest as thou art for that detested band
thy lying prophecies deceived the land
against ulysses have thy vows been made
for them thy daily orisons were paid
yet more een to our bed thy pride aspires
one common crime one common fate requires

thus speaking from the ground the sword he took
which agelaus dying hand forsook
full through his neck the weighty falchion sped
along the pavement rolld the muttering head

phemius alone the hand of vengeance spared
phemius the sweet the heaveninstructed bard
beside the gate the reverend minstrel stands
the lyre now silent trembling in his hands
dubious to supplicate the chief or fly
to joves inviolable altar nigh
where oft laertes holy vows had paid
and oft ulysses smoking victims laid
his honourd harp with care he first set down
between the laver and the silver throne
then prostrate stretchd before the dreadful man
persuasive thus with accent soft began

o king to mercy be thy soul inclined
and spare the poets evergentle kind
a deed like this thy future fame would wrong
for dear to gods and men is sacred song
selftaught i sing by heaven and heaven alone
the genuine seeds of poesy are sown
and  the lofty lay
to gods alone and godlike worth we pay
save then the poet and thyself reward
tis thine to merit mine is to record
that here i sung was force and not desire
this hand reluctant touchd the warbling wire
and let thy son attest nor sordid pay
nor servile flattery staind the moral lay

the moving words telemachus attends
his sire approaches and the bard defends
o mix not father with those impious dead
the man divine forbear that sacred head
medon the herald too our arms may spare
medon who made my infancy his care
if yet he breathes permit thy son to give
thus much to gratitude and bid him live

beneath a table trembling with dismay
couchd close to earth unhappy medon lay
wrappd in a newslain oxs ample hide
swift at the word he cast his screen aside
sprung to the prince embraced his knee with tears
and thus with grateful voice addressd his ears

o prince o friend lo here thy medon stands
ah stop the heros unresisted hands
incensed too justly by that impious brood
whose guilty glories now are set in blood
to whom ulysses with a pleasing eye

be bold on friendship and my son rely
live an example for the world to read
how much more safe the good than evil deed
thou with the heaventaught bard in peace resort
from blood and carnage to yon open court
me other work requires with timorous awe
from the dire scene the exempted two withdraw
scarce sure of life look round and trembling move
to the bright altars of protector jove

meanwhile ulysses searchd the dome to find
if yet there live of all the offending kind
not one complete the bloody tale he found
all steepd in blood all gasping on the ground
so when by hollow shores the fishertrain
sweep with their arching nets the roaring main
and scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain
all naked of their element and bare
the fishes pant and gasp in thinner air
wide oer the sands are spread the stiffening prey
till the warm sun exhales their soul away

and now the king commands his son to call
old euryclea to the deathful hall
the son observant not a moment stays
the aged governess with speed obeys
the sounding portals instant they display
the matron moves the prince directs the way
on heaps of death the stern ulysses stood
all black with dust and coverd thick with blood
so the grim lion from the slaughter comes
dreadful he glares and terribly he foams
his breast with marks of carnage painted oer
his jaws all dropping with the bulls black gore

soon as her eyes the welcome object met
the guilty falln the mighty deed complete
a scream of joy her feeble voice essayd
the hero checkd her and composedly said

woman experienced as thou art control
indecent joy and feast thy secret soul
to insult the dead is cruel and unjust
fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust
nor heeded these the censure of mankind
the good and bad were equal in their mind
justly the price of worthlessness they paid
and each now wails an unlamented shade
but thou sincere o euryclea say
what maids dishonour us and what obey

then she in these thy kingly walls remain
 full fifty of the handmaid train
taught by my care to cull the fleece or weave
and servitude with pleasing tasks deceive
of these twice six pursue their wicked way
nor me nor chaste penelope obey
nor fits it that telemachus command
 his mothers female band
hence to the upper chambers let me fly
where slumbers soft now close the royal eye
there wake her with the newsthe matron cried
not so 
bring first the crew who wrought these guilty deeds
in haste the matron parts the king proceeds
now to dispose the dead the care remains
to you my son and you my faithfull swains
the offending females to that task we doom
to wash to scent and purify the room
these 
drive to yon court without the palace wall
there the revenging sword shall smite them all
so with the suitors let them mix in dust
stretchd in a long oblivion of their lust
he said the lamentable train appear
each vents a groan and drops a tender tear
each heaved her mournful burden and beneath
the porch deposed the ghastly heap of death
the chief severe compelling each to move
urged the dire task imperious from above
with thirsty sponge they rub the tables oer
 the walls the floor
washd with the effusive wave are purged of gore
once more the palace set in fair array
to the base court the females take their way
there compassd close between the dome and wall
 they trembling wait their fall

then thus the prince to these shall we afford
a fate so pure as by the martial sword
to these the nightly prostitutes to shame
and base revilers of our house and name

thus speaking on the circling wall he strung
a ships tough cable from a column hung
near the high top he straind it strongly round
whence no contending foot could reach the ground
their heads above connected in a row
they beat the air with quivering feet below
thus on some tree hung struggling in the snare
the doves or thrushes flap their wings in air
soon fled the soul impure and left behind
the empty corse to waver with the wind

then forth they led melanthius and began
their bloody work they loppd away the man
morsel for dogs then trimmd with brazen shears
the wretch and shortend of his nose and ears
his hands and feet last felt the cruel steel
he roard and torments gave his soul to hell
they wash and to ulysses take their way
so ends the bloody business of the day

to euryclea then addressd the king
bring hither fire and hither sulphur bring
to purge the palace then the queen attend
and let her with her matrontrain descend
the matrontrain with all the virginband
assemble here to learn their lords command

then euryclea joyful i obey
but cast those mean dishonest rags away
permit me first the royal robes to bring
ill suits this garb the shoulders of a king
bring sulphur straight and fire 
she hears and at the word obedient flies
with fire and sulphur cure of noxious fumes
he purged the walls and bloodpolluted rooms
again the matron springs with eager pace
and spreads her lords return from place to place
they hear rush forth and instant round him stand
a gazing throng a torch in every hand
they saw they knew him and with fond embrace
each humbly kissd his knee or hand or face
he knows them all in all such truth appears
een he indulges the sweet joy of tears







then to the queen as in repose she lay
the nurse with eager rapture speeds her way
the transports of her faithful heart supply
a sudden youth and give her wings to fly

and sleeps my child 
ulysses lives arise my child arise
at length appears the longexpected hour
ulysses comes the suitors are no more
no more they view the golden light of day
arise and bless thee with the glad survey

touchd at her words the mournful queen rejoind
ah whither wanders thy distemperd mind
the righteous powers who tread the starry skies
the weak enlighten and confound the wise
and human thought with unresisted sway
depress or raise enlarge or take away
truth by their high decree thy voice forsakes
and folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks
unkind the fond illusion to impose
was it to flatter or deride my woes
never did i sleep so sweet enjoy
since my dear lord left ithaca for troy
why must i wake to grieve and curse thy shore
o troymay never tongue pronounce thee more
begone another might have felt our rage
but age is sacred and we spare thy age

to whom with warmth my soul a lie disdains
ulysses lives thy own ulysses reigns
that stranger patient of the suitors wrongs
and the rude license of ungovernd tongues
he he is thine thy son his latent guest
long knew but lockd the secret in his breast
with well concerted art to end his woes
and burst at once in vengeance on the foes

while yet she spoke the queen in transport sprung
swift from the couch and round the matron hung
fast from her eye descends the rolling tear
say once more say is my ulysses here
how could that numerous and outrageous band
by one be slain though by a heros hand

i saw it not  but heard alone
when death was busy a loud dying groan
the damseltrain turnd pale at every wound
immured we sate and catchd each passing sound
when death had seized her prey thy son attends
and at his nod the damseltrain descends
there terrible in arms ulysses stood
and the dead suitors almost swam in blood
thy heart had leapd the hero to survey
stern as the surly lion oer his prey
glorious in gore now with sulphereous fire
the dome he purges now the flame aspires
heapd lie the dead without the palace walls
haste daughter haste thy own ulysses calls
thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow
enjoy the present good and former woe
ulysses lives his vanquishd foes to see
he lives to thy telemachus and thee

ah no 
excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind
how blest this happy hour should he appear
dear to us all to me supremely dear
ah no some god the suitors death decreed
some god descends and by his hand they bleed
blind to contemn the strangers righteous cause
and violate all hospitable laws
the good they hated and the powers defied
but heaven is just and by a god they died
for never must ulysses view this shore
never the loved ulysses is no more

what words  have reachd my ears
doubt we his presence when he now appears
then hear conviction ere the fatal day
that forced ulysses oer the watery way
a boar fierce rushing in the sylvan war
ploughd half his thigh i saw i saw the scar
and wild with transport had reveald the wound
but ere i spoke he rose and checkd the sound
then daughter haste away and if a lie
flow from this tongue then let thy servant die
to whom with dubious joy the queen replies
wise is thy soul but errors seize the wise
the works of gods what mortal can survey
who knows their motives who shall trace their way
but learn we instant how the suitors trod
the paths of death by man or by a god
thus speaks the queen and no reply attends
but with alternate joy and fear descends
at every step debates her lord to prove
or rushing to his arms confess her love
then gliding through the marble valves in state
opposed before the shining sire she sate
the monarch by a column high enthroned
his eye withdrew and fixd it on the ground
curious to hear his queen the silence break
amazed she sate and impotent to speak
oer all the man her eyes she rolls in vain
now hopes now fears now knows then doubts again
at length telemachus oh who can find
a woman like penelope unkind
why thus in silence why with winning charms
thus slow to fly with rapture to his arms
stubborn the breast that with no transport glows
when twice ten years are passd of mighty woes
to softness lost to spousal love unknown
the gods have formed that rigid heart of stone
o my telemachus 
distracting fears confound my labouring mind
powerless to speak i scarce uplift my eyes
nor dare to question doubts on doubts arise
oh deign he if ulysses to remove
these boding thoughts and what he is to prove
pleased with her virtuous fears the king replies
indulge my son the cautions of the wise
time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring
this garb of poverty belies the king
no more this day our deepest care requires
cautious to act what thought mature inspires
if one mans blood though mean distain our hands
the homicide retreats to foreign lands
by us in heaps the illustrious peerage falls
the important deed our whole attention calls

be that thy care 
the world conspires to speak ulysses wise
for wisdom all is thine lo i obey
and dauntless follow where you led the way
nor shalt thou in the day of danger find
thy coward son degenerate lag behind

then instant to the bath 
bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise
thence all descend in pomp and proud array
and bid the dome resound the mirthful lay
while the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings
and forms the dance responsive to the strings
that hence the eluded passengers may say
lo the queen weds we hear the spousal lay
the suitors death unknown till we remove
far from the court and act inspired by jove

thus spoke the king the observant train obey
at once they bathe and dress in proud array
the lyrist strikes the string gay youths advance
and fairzoned damsels form the sprightly dance
the voice attuned to instrumental sounds
ascends the roof the vaulted roof rebounds
not unobserved the greeks eluded say
lo the queen weds we hear the spousal lay
inconstant to admit the bridal hour
thus theybut nobly chaste she weds no more

meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends
with faithful cares eurynome attends
oer every limb a shower of fragrance sheds
then dressd in pomp magnificent he treads
the warriorgoddess gives his frame to shine
with majesty enlarged and grace divine
back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly
his thick large locks of hyacinthine dye
as by some artist to whom vulcan gives
his heavenly skill a breathing image lives
by pallas taught he frames the wondrous mould
and the pale silver glows with fusile gold
so pallas his heroic form improves
with bloom divine and like a god he moves
more high he treads and issuing forth in state
radiant before his gazing consort sate
and o my queen  what power above
has steeld that heart averse to spousal love
canst thou penelope when heaven restores
thy lost ulysses to his native shores
canst thou o cruel unconcernd survey
thy lost ulysses on this signal day
haste euryclea and despatchful spread
for me and me alone the imperial bed
my weary nature craves the balm of rest
but heaven with adamant has armd her breast

ah no  a tender heart i bear
a foe to pride no adamant is there
and now een now it melts for sure i see
once more ulysses my beloved in thee
fixd in my soul as when he sailed to troy
his image dwells then haste the bed of joy
haste from the bridal bower the bed translate
framd by his hand and be it dressd in state

thus speaks the queen still dubious with disguise
touchd at her words the king with warmth replies
alas for this what mortal strength can move
the enormous burden who but heaven above
it mocks the weak attempts of human hands
but the whole earth must move if heaven commands
then hear sure evidence while we display
words seald with sacred truth and truth obey
this hand the wonder framed an olive spread
full in the court its ever verdant head
vast as some mighty columns bulk on high
the huge trunk rose and heaved into the sky
around the tree i raised a nuptial bower
and roofd defensive of the storm and shower
the spacious valve with art inwrought conjoins
and the fair dome with polished marble shines
i loppd the branchy head aloft in twain
severd the bole and smoothed the shining grain
then posts capacious of the frame i raise
and bore it regular from space to space
athwart the frame at equal distance lie
thongs of tough hides that boast a purple dye
then polishing the whole the finished mould
with silver shone with elephant and gold
but if oerturnd by rude ungovernd hands
or still inviolate the olive stands
tis thine o queen to say and now impart
if fears remain or doubts distract thy heart

while yet he speaks her powers of life decay
she sickens trembles falls and faints away
at length recovering to his arms she flew
and straind him close as to his breast she grew
the tears pourd down amain and o 
let not against thy spouse thine anger rise
o versed in every turn of human art
forgive the weakness of a womans heart
the righteous powers that mortal lot dispose
decree us to sustain a length of woes
and from the flower of life the bliss deny
to bloom together fade away and die
o let me let me not thine anger move
that i forbore thus thus to speak my love
thus in fond kisses while the transport warms
pour out my soul and die within thine arms
i dreaded fraud men faithless men betray
our easy faith and make our sex their prey
against the fondness of my heart i strove
twas caution o my lord not want of love
like me had helen feard with wanton charms
ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms
ere greece rose dreadful in the avenging day
thus had she feard she had not gone astray
but heaven averse to greece in wrath decreed
that she should wander and that greece should bleed
blind to the ills that from injustice flow
she colourd all our wretched lives with woe
but why these sorrows when my lord arrives
i yield i yield my own ulysses lives
the secrets of the bridal bed are known
to thee to me to actoris alone

since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveald
hard and distrustful as i am i yield

touchd to the soul the king with rapture hears
hangs round her neck and speaks his joy in tears
as to the shipwreckd mariner the shores
delightful rise when angry neptune roars
then when the surge in thunder mounts the sky
and gulfd in crowds at once the sailors die
if one more happy while the tempest raves
outlives the tumult of conflicting waves
all pale with ooze deformd he views the strand
and plunging forth with transport grasps the land
the ravishd queen with equal rapture glows
clasps her loved lord and to his bosom grows
nor had they ended till the morning ray
but pallas backward held the rising day
the wheels of night retarding to detain
the gay aurora in the wavy main
whose flaming steeds emerging through the night
beam oer the eastern hills with streaming light

at length ulysses with a sigh replies
yet fate yet cruel fate repose denies
a labour long and hard remains behind
by heaven above by hell beneath enjoind
for to tiresias through the eternal gates
of hell i trode to learn my future fates
but end we herethe night demands repose
be deckd the couch and peace awhile my woes

to whom the queen thy word we shall obey
and deck the couch far hence be woes away
since the just gods who tread the starry plains
restore thee safe since my ulysses reigns
but what those perils heaven decrees impart
knowledge may grieve but fear distracts the heart

to this the king ah why must i disclose
a dreadful story of approaching woes
why in this hour of transport wound thy ears
when thou must learn what i must speak with tears
heaven by the theban ghost thy spouse decrees
torn from thy arms to sail a length of seas
from realm to realm a nation to explore
who neer knew salt or heard the billows roar
nor saw gay vessel storm the surgy plain
a painted wonder flying on the main
an oar my hand must bear a shepherd eyes
the unknown instrument with strange surprise
and calls a cornvan this upon the plain
i fix and hail the monarch of the main
then bathe his altars with the mingled gore
of victims vowd a ram a bull a boar
thence swift resailing to my native shores
due victims slay to all the ethereal powers
then heaven decrees in peace to end my days
and steal myself from life by slow decays
unknown to pain in age resign my breath
when late stern neptune points the shaft of death
to the dark grave retiring as to rest
my people blessing by my people blessd
such future scenes the allrighteous powers display
by their dread seer and such my future day

to whom thus firm of soul if ripe for death
and full of days thou gently yield thy breath
while heaven a kind release from ills foreshows
triumph thou happy victor of thy woes

but euryclea with dispatchful care
and sage eurynome the couch prepare
instant they bid the blazing torch display
around the dome and artificial day
then to repose her steps the matron bends
and to the queen eurynome descends
a torch she bears to light with guiding fires
the royal pair she guides them and retires
the instant his fair spouse ulysses led
to the chaste loverites of the nuptial bed

and now the blooming youths and sprightly fair
cease the gay dance and to their rest repair
but in discourse the king and consort lay
while the soft hours stole unperceived away
intent he hears penelope disclose
a mournful story of domestic woes
his servants insults his invaded bed
how his whole flocks and herds exhausted bled
his generous wines dishonourd shed in vain
and the wild riots of the suitortrain
the king alternate a dire tale relates
of wars of triumphs and disastrous fates
all he unfolds his listening spouse turns pale
with pleasing horror at the dreadful tale
sleepless devours each word and hears how slain
cicons on cicons swell the ensanguined plain
how to the land of lote unblessd he sails
and images the rills and flowery vales
how dashd like dogs his friends the cyclops tore
 and quaffd the spouting gore
how the loud storms in prison bound he sails
from friendly aeolus with prosperous gales
yet fate withstands a sudden tempest roars
and whirls him groaning from his native shores
how on the barbarous laestrigonian coast
by savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost
how scarce himself survived he paints the bower
the spells of circe and her magic power
his dreadful journey to the realms beneath
to seek tiresias in the vales of death
how in the doleful mansions lie surveyd
his royal mother pale anticleas shade
and friends in battle slain heroic ghosts
then how unharmd he passd the syrencoasts
the justling rocks where fierce charybdis raves
and howling scylla whirls her thunderous waves
the cave of death how his companions slay
the oxen sacred to the god of day
till jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides
and whelms the offenders in the roaring tides
how struggling through the surge he reachd the shores
of fair ogygia and calypsos bowers
where the gay blooming nymph constraind his stay
with sweet reluctant amorous delay
and promised vainly promised to bestow
immortal life exempt from age and woe
how saved from storms phæacias coast he trod
by great alcinous honourd as a god
who gave him last his country to behold
with change of raiment brass and heaps of gold

he ended sinking into sleep and shares
a sweet forgetfulness of all his cares

soon as soft slumber eased the toils of day
minerva rushes through the aërial way
and bids aurora with her golden wheels
flame from the ocean oer the eastern hills
uprose ulysses from the genial bed
and thus with thought mature the monarch said

my queen my consort through a length of years
we drank the cup of sorrow mixd with tears
thou for thy lord while me the immortal powers
detaind reluctant from my native shores
now blessd again by heaven the queen display
and rule our palace with an equal sway
be it my care by loans or martial toils
to throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils
but now i haste to bless laertes eyes
with sight of his ulysses ere he dies
the good old man to wasting woes a prey
weeps a sad life in solitude away
but hear though wise this morning shall unfold
the deathful scene on heroes heroes rolld
thou with thy maids within the palace stay
from all the scene of tumult far away

he spoke and sheathed in arms incessant flies
to wake his son and bid his friends arise
to arms aloud he cries his friends obey
with glittering arms their manly limbs array
and pass the city gate ulysses leads the way
now flames the rosy dawn but pallas shrouds
the latent warriors in a veil of clouds






cyllenius now to plutos dreary reign
conveys the dead a lamentable train
the golden wand that causes sleep to fly
or in soft slumber seals the wakeful eye
that drives the ghosts to realms of night or day
points out the long uncomfortable way
trembling the spectres glide and plaintive vent
thin hollow screams along the deep descent
as in the cavern of some rifted den
where flock nocturnal bats and birds obscene
clusterd they hang till at some sudden shock
they move and murmurs run through all the rock
so cowering fled the sable heaps of ghosts
and such a scream filld all the dismal coasts
and now they reachd the earths remotest ends
and now the gates where evening sol descends
and leucas rock and oceans utmost streams
and now pervade the dusky land of dreams
and rest at last where souls unbodied dwell
in everflowing meads of asphodel
the empty forms of men inhabit there
impassive semblance images of air
naught else are all that shined on earth before
ajax and great achilles are no more
yet still a master ghost the rest he awed
the rest adored him towering as he trod
still at his side is nestors son surveyd
and loved patroclus still attends his shade

new as they were to that infernal shore
the suitors stoppd and gazed the hero oer
when moving slow the regal form they viewd
of great atrides him in pomp pursued
and solemn sadness through the gloom of hell
the train of those who by aegysthus fell

o mighty chief 
honourd by jove above the lot of man
king of a hundred kings to whom resignd
the strongest bravest greatest of mankind
comest thou the first to view this dreary state
and was the noblest the first mark of fate
condemnd to pay the great arrear so soon
the lot which all lament and none can shun
oh better hadst thou sunk in trojan ground
with all thy fullblown honours coverd round
then grateful greece with streaming eyes might raise
historic marbles to record thy praise
thy praise eternal on the faithful stone
had with transmissive glories graced thy son
but heavier fates were destined to attend
what man is happy till he knows his end

o son of peleus greater than mankind

thrice happy thou to press the martial plain
midst heaps of heroes in thy quarrel slain
in clouds of smoke raised by the noble fray
great and terrific een in death you lay
and deluges of blood flowd round you every way
nor ceased the strife till jove himself opposed
and all in tempests the dire evening closed
then to the fleet we bore thy honourd load
and decent on the funeral bed bestowd
then unguents sweet and tepid streams we shed
tears flowd from every eye and oer the dead
each clippd the curling honours of his head
struck at the news thy azure mother came
the seagreen sisters waited on the dame
a voice of loud lament through all the main
was heard and terror seized the grecian train
back to their ships the frighted host had fled
but nestor spoke they listend and obeyd

forbear your flight fair thetis from the main
to mourn achilles leads her azure train
around thee stand the daughters of the deep
robe thee in heavenly vests and round thee weep
round thee the muses with alternate strain
in everconsecrating verse complain
each warlike greek the moving music hears
and ironhearted heroes melt in tears
till seventeen nights and seventeen days returnd
all that was mortal or immortal mournd
to flames we gave thee the succeeding day
and fatted sheep and sable oxen slay
with oils and honey blazed the augmented fires
and like a god adornd thy earthly part expires
unnumberd warriors round the burning pile
urge the fleet coursers or the racers toil
thick clouds of dust oer all the circle rise
and the mixd clamour thunders in the skies
soon as absorbd in allembracing flame
sunk what was mortal of thy mighty name
we then collect thy snowy bones and place
with wines and unguents in a golden vase

there we thy relics great achilles blend
with dear patroclus thy departed friend
in the same urn a separate space contains
thy next beloved antilochus remains
now all the sons of warlike greece surround
thy destined tomb and cast a mighty mound
high on the shore the growing hill we raise
that wide the extended hellespont surveys
where all from age to age who pass the coast
may point achilles tomb and hail the mighty ghost
thetis herself to all our peers proclaims
heroic prizes and exequial games
the gods assented and around thee lay
rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day
oft have i seen with solemn funeral games
heroes and kings committed to the flames
but strength of youth or valour of the brave
with nobler contest neer renownd a grave
such were the games by azure thetis given
and such thy honours o beloved of heaven
dear to mankind thy fame survives nor fades
its bloom eternal in the stygian shades
but what to me avail my honours gone
successful toils and battles bravely won
doomd by stern jove at home to end my life
by cursed ægysthus and a faithless wife
thus they while hermes oer the dreary plain
led the sad numbers by ulysses slain
on each majestic form they cast a view
and timorous passd and awfully withdrew
but agamemnon through the gloomy shade
his ancient host amphimedon surveyd
son of melanthius  o say
what cause compelld so many and so gay
to tread the downward melancholy way
say could one city yield a troop so fair
were all these partners of one native air
or did the rage of stormy neptune sweep
your lives at once and whelm beneath the deep
did nightly thieves or pirates cruel bands
drench with your blood your pillaged countrys sands
or welldefending some beleaguerd wall
sayfor the public did ye greatly fall
inform thy guest for such i was of yore
when our triumphant navies touchd your shore
forced a long month the wintry seas to bear
to move the great ulysses to the war

o king of men i faithful shall relate
 our hapless fate
ulysses absent our ambitious aim
with rival loves pursued his royal dame
her coy reserve and prudence mixd with pride
our common suit nor granted nor denied
but close with inward hate our deaths designd
versed in all arts of wily womankind
her hand laborious in delusion spread
a spacious loom and mixd the various thread
ye peers  who press to gain my heart
where dead ulysses claims no more a part
yet a short space your rival suit suspend
till this funereal web my labours end
cease till to good laertes i bequeath
a task of grief his ornaments of death
lest when the fates his royal ashes claim
the grecian matrons taint my spotless fame
should he long honourd with supreme command
want the last duties of a daughters hand

the fiction pleased our generous train complies
nor fraud mistrusts in virtues fair disguise
the work she plied but studious of delay
each following night reversed the toils of day
unheard unseen three years her arts prevail
the fourth her maid reveald the amazing tale
and showd as unperceived we took our stand
the backward labours of her faithless hand
forced she completes it and before us lay
the mingled web whose gold and silver ray
displayd the radiance of the night and day

just as she finished her illustrious toil
ill fortune led ulysses to our isle
far in a lonely nook beside the sea
at an old swineherds rural lodge he lay
thither his son from sandy pyle repairs
and speedy lands and secretly confers
they plan our future ruin and resort
confederate to the city and the court
first came the son the father next succeeds
clad like a beggar whom eumaeus leads
proppd on a staff deformd with age and care
and hung with rags that flutterd in the air
who could ulysses in that form behold
scornd by the young forgotten by the old
illused by all to every wrong resigned
patient he suffered with a constant mind
but when arising in his wrath to obey
the will of jove he gave the vengeance way
the scattered arms that hung around the dome
careful he treasured in a private room
then to her suitors bade his queen propose
the archers strife the source of future woes
and omen of our death in vain we drew
the twanging string and tried the stubborn yew
to none it yields but great ulysses hands
in vain we threat telemachus commands
the bow he snatchd and in an instant bent
through every ring the victor arrow went
fierce on the threshold then in arms he stood
poured forth the darts that thirsted for our blood
and frownd before us dreadful as a god
first bleeds antinous thick the shafts resound
and heaps on heaps the wretches strew the ground
this way and that we turn we fly we fall
some god assisted and unmannd us all
ignoble cries precede the dying groans
and battered brains and blood besmear the stones

thus great atrides thus ulysses drove
the shades thou seest from yon fair realms above
our mangled bodies now deformed with gore
cold and neglected spread the marble floor
no friend to bathe our wounds or tears to shed
oer the pale corse the honours of the dead

oh blessd ulysses  in thy consort blessd
not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined
not more thy patience than her constant mind
icarius daughter glory of the past
and model to the future age shall last
the gods to honour her fair fame shall rise
 a poet in her praise
not such o tyndarus thy daughters deed
by whose dire hand her king and husband bled
her shall the muse to infamy prolong
example dread and theme of tragic song
the general sex shall suffer in her shame
and een the best that bears a womans name

thus in the regions of eternal shade
conferrd the mournful phantoms of the dead
while from the town ulysses and his band
passd to laertes cultivated land
the ground himself had purchased with his pain
and labour made the rugged soil a plain
there stood his mansion of the rural sort
with useful buildings round the lowly court
where the few servants that divide his care
took their laborious rest and homely fare
and one sicilian matron old and sage
with constant duty tends his drooping age

here now arriving to his rustic band
and martial son ulysses gave command
enter the house and of the bristly swine
select the largest to the powers divine
alone and unattended let me try
if yet i share the old mans memory
if those dim eyes can yet ulysses know

now changed with time with absence and with woe
then to his train he gives his spear and shield
the house they enter and he seeks the field
through rows of shade with various fruitage crownd
and labourd scenes of richest verdure round
nor aged dolius nor his sons were there
nor servants absent on another care
to search the woods for sets of flowery thorn
their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn

but all alone the hoary king he found
his habit course but warmly wrappd around
his head that bowd with many a pensive care
fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair
his buskins old in former service torn
but swell repaird and gloves against the thorn
in this array the kingly gardener stood
and cleard a plant encumberd with its wood

beneath a neighbouring tree the chief divine
gazed oer his sire retracing every line
the ruins of himself now worn away
with age yet still majestic in decay
sudden his eyes released their watery store
the muchenduring man could bear no more
doubtful he stood if instant to embrace
his aged limbs to kiss his reverend face
with eager transport to disclose the whole
and pour at once the torrent of his soul
not so his judgment takes the winding way
of question distant and of soft essay
more gentle methods on weak age employs
and moves the sorrows to enhance the joys
then to his sire with beating heart he moves
and with a tender pleasantry reproves
who digging round the plant still hangs his bead
nor aught remits the work while thus he said

great is thy skill o father great thy toil
thy careful hand is stampd on all the soil
thy squadrond vineyards well thy art declare
the olive green blue fig and pendent pear
and not one empty spot escapes thy care
on every plant and tree thy cares are shown
nothing neglected but thyself alone
forgive me father if this fault i blame
age so advanced may some indulgence claim
not for thy sloth i deem thy lord unkind
nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind
i read a monarch in that princely air
the same thy aspect if the same thy care
soft sleep fair garments and the joys of wine
these are the rights of age and should be thine
who then thy master say and whose the land
so dressd and managed by thy skilful hand
but chief oh tell me 
is this the farfamed ithacensian coast
for so reported the first man i viewd

nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay
heedless he whistled and pursued his way
but thou whom years have taught to understand
humanely hear and answer my demand
a friend i seek a wise one and a brave
say lives he yet or moulders in the grave
time was 
when at my house i lodged this foreign guest
he said from ithacas fair isle he came
and old laertes was his fathers name
to him whatever to a guest is owed
i paid and hospitable gifts bestowd
to him seven talents of pure ore i told
twelve cloaks twelve vests twelve tunics stiff with gold
a bowl that rich with polishd silver flames
and skilld in female works four lovely dames

at this the father with a fathers fears

this is the land but ah thy gifts are lost
for godless men and rude possess the coast
sunk is the glory of this oncefamed shore
thy ancient friend o stranger is no more
full recompense thy bounty else had borne
for every good man yields a just return
so civil rights demand and who begins
the track of friendship not pursuing sins
but tell me stranger be the truth confessd
what years have circled since thou sawst that guest
that hapless guest alas for ever gone
wretch that he was and that i am my son
if ever man to misery was born
twas his to suffer and tis mine to mourn
far from his friends and from his native reign
he lies a prey to monsters of the main
or savage beasts his mangled relics tear
or screaming vultures scatter through the air
nor could his mother funeral unguents shed
nor waild his father oer the untimely dead
nor his sad consort on the mournful bier
seald his cold eyes or droppd a tender tear

but tell me who thou art and what thy race
thy town thy parents and thy native place
or if a merchant in pursuit of gain
what port received thy vessel from the main
or comest thou single or attend thy train

then thus the son from alybas i came
my palace there eperitus my name
not vulgar born from aphidas the king
of polyphemons royal line i spring
some adverse demon from sicania bore
our wandering course and drove us on your shore
far from the town an unfrequented bay
relieved our wearied vessel from the sea
five years have circled since these eyes pursued
ulysses parting through the sable flood
prosperous he saild with dexter auguries
and all the wingd good omens of the skies
well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore
whom heaven alas decreed to meet no more

quick through the fathers heart these accents ran
grief seized at once and wrappd up all the man
deep from his soul he sighd and sorrowing spread
a cloud of ashes on his hoary head
trembling with agonies of strong delight
stood the great son heartwounded with the sight
he ran he seized him with a strict embrace
with thousand kisses wanderd oer his face
i i am he o father rise behold
thy son with twenty winters now grown old
thy son so long desired so long detaind
restored and breathing in his native land
these floods of sorrow o my sire restrain
the vengeance is complete the suitor train
stretchd in our palace by these hands lie slain

amazed laertes give some certain sign
 to manifest thee mine

lo here the wound  received of yore
the scar indented by the tusky boar
when by thyself and by anticlea sent
to old autolycus realms i went
yet by another sign thy offspring know
the several trees you gave me long ago
while yet a child these fields i loved to trace
and trod thy footsteps with unequal pace
to every plant in order as we came
wellpleased you told its nature and its name
whateer my childish fancy askd bestowd
twelve peartrees bowing with their pendent load
and ten that red with blushing apples glowd
full fifty purple figs and many a row
of various vines that then began to blow
a future vintage when the hours produce
their latent buds and sol exalts the juice

smit with the signs which all his doubts explain
his heart within him melts his knees sustain
their feeble weight no more his arms alone
support him round the loved ulysses thrown
he faints he sinks with mighty joys oppressd
ulysses clasps him to his eager breast
soon as returning life regains its seat
and his breath lengthens and his pulses beat
yes i believe  almighty jove
heaven rules us yet and gods there are above
tis sothe suitors for their wrongs have paid
but what shall guard us if the town invade
if while the news through every city flies
all ithaca and cephalenia rise
to this ulysses as the gods shall please
be all the rest and set thy soul at ease
haste to the cottage by this orchards side
and take the banquet which our cares provide
there wait thy faithful band of rural friends
and there the young telemachus attends

thus having said they traced the garden oer
and stooping entered at the lowly door
the swains and young telemachus they found
the victim portiond and the goblet crownd
the hoary king his old sicilian maid
perfumd and washd and gorgeously arrayed
pallas attending gives his frame to shine
with awful port and majesty divine
his gazing son admires the godlike grace
and air celestial dawning oer his face
what god  my fathers form improves
how high he treads and how enlarged he moves

oh would to all the deathless powers on high
pallas and jove and him who gilds the sky

my strength were still as once in better days
when the bold cephalens the leaguer formd
and proud nericus trembled as i stormd
such were i now not absent from your deed
when the last sun beheld the suitors bleed
this arm had aided yours this hand bestrown
our shores with death and pushd the slaughter on
nor had the sire been separate from the son

they communed thus while homeward bent their way
the swains fatigued with labours of the day
dolius the first the venerable man
and next his sons a long succeeding train
for due refection to the bower they came
calld by the careful old sicilian dame
who nursed the children and now tends the sire
they see their lord they gaze and they admire
on chairs and beds in order seated round
they share the gladsome board the roofs resound
while thus ulysses to his ancient friend
forbear your wonder and the feast attend
the rites have waited long the chief commands
their love in vain old dolius spreads his hands
springs to his master with a warm embrace
and fastens kisses on his hands and face
then thus broke out o long o daily mournd
beyond our hopes and to our wish returnd
conducted sure by heaven for heaven alone
could work this wonder welcome to thy own
and joys and happiness attend thy throne
who knows thy blessd thy wishd return oh say
to the chaste queen shall we the news convey
or hears she and with blessings loads the day

dismiss that care for to the royal bride
already is it known  while round him bows
each faithful youth and breathes out ardent vows
then all beneath their father take their place
rankd by their ages and the banquet grace

now flying fame the swift report had spread
through all the city of the suitors dead
in throngs they rise and to the palace crowd
their sighs were many and the tumult loud
weeping they bear the mangled heaps of slain
inhume the natives in their native plain
the rest in ships are wafted oer the main
then sad in council all the seniors sate
frequent and full assembled to debate
amid the circle first eupithes rose
big was his eye with tears his heart with woes
the bold antinous was his ages pride
the first who by ulysses arrow died
down his wan cheek the trickling torrent ran
as mixing words with sighs he thus began

great deeds o friends this wondrous man has wrought
and mighty blessings to his country brought
with ships he parted and a numerous train
those and their ships he buried in the main
now he returns and first essays his hand
in the best blood of all his native land
haste then and ere to neighbouring pyle he flies
or sacred elis to procure supplies
arise  arise
shame to this age and all that shall succeed
if unrevenged your sons and brothers bleed
prove that we live by vengeance on his head
or sink at once forgotten with the dead
here ceased he but indignant tears let fall
spoke when he ceased dumb sorrow touchd them all
when from the palace to the wondering throng
sage medon came and phemius came along

and medon first the assembled chiefs bespoke

hear me ye peers and elders of the land
who deem this act the work of mortal hand
as oer the heaps of death ulysses strode
these eyes these eyes beheld a present god
who now before him now beside him stood
fought as he fought and markd his way with blood
in vain old mentors form the god belied
twas heaven that struck and heaven was on his side

a sudden horror all the assembly shook
when slowly rising halitherses spoke

me too ye fathers hear from you proceed
the ills ye mourn your own the guilty deed
ye gave your sons your lawless sons the rein

an absent heros bed they sought to soil
an absent heros wealth they made their spoil
immoderate riot and intemperate lust
the offence was great the punishment was just
weigh then my counsels in an equal scale
nor rush to ruin justice will prevail

his moderate words some better minds persuade
they part and join him but the number stayd
they storm they shout with hasty frenzy fired
and second all eupithes rage inspired
they case their limbs in brass to arms they run
the broad effulgence blazes in the sun
before the city and in ample plain
they meet eupithes heads the frantic train
fierce for his son he breathes his threats in air
fate bears them not and death attends him there

this passd on earth while in the realms above
minerva thus to cloudcompelling jove
may i presume to search thy secret soul
o power supreme o ruler of the whole
say hast thou doomd to this divided state
or peaceful amity or stern debate
declare thy purpose for thy will is fate

is not thy thought my own 
hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed
the chiefs return should make the guilty bleed
tis done and at thy will the fates succeed
yet hear the issue since ulysses hand
has slain the suitors heaven shall bless the land
none now the kindred of the unjust shall own
forgot the slaughterd brother and the son
each future day increase of wealth shall bring
and oer the past oblivion stretch her wing
long shall ulysses in his empire rest
his people blessing by his people blessd
let all be peacehe said and gave the nod
that binds the fates the sanction of the god
and prompt to execute the eternal will
descended pallas from the olympian hill

now sat ulysses at the rural feast
the rage of hunger and of thirst repressd
to watch the foe a trusty spy he sent
a son of dolius on the message went
stood in the way and at a glance beheld
the foe approach embattled on the field
with backward step he hastens to the bower
and tells the news they arm with all their power
four friends alone ulysses cause embrace
and six were all the sons of dolius race
old dolius too his rusted arms put on
and still more old in arms laertes shone
trembling with warmth the hoary heroes stand
and brazen panoply invests the band
the opening gates at once their war display
fierce they rush forth ulysses leads the way
that moment joins them with celestial aid
in mentors form the jovedescended maid
the suffering hero felt his patient breast
swell with new joy and thus his son addressd

behold telemachus 
the brave embattled the grim front of fight
the valiant with the valiant must contend
shame not the line whence glorious you descend
wide oer the world their martial fame was spread
regard thyself the living and the dead

thy eyes great father on this battle cast
shall learn from me penelope was chaste

so spoke telemachus the gallant boy
good old laertes heard with panting joy
and blessd thrice blessd this happy day 
the day that shows me ere i close my eyes
a son and grandson of the arcesian name
strive for fair virtue and contest for fame

then thus minerva in laertes ear
son of arcesius reverend warrior hear
jove and joves daughter first implore in prayer
then whirling high discharge thy lance in air
she said infusing courage with the word
jove and joves daughter then the chief implored
and whirling high dismissd the lance in air
full at eupithes drove the deathful spear
the brasscheekd helmet opens to the wound
he falls earth thunders and his arms resound
before the father and the conquering son
heaps rush on heaps they fight they drop they run
now by the sword and now the javelin fall
the rebel race and death had swallowd all
but from on high the blueeyed virgin cried
her awful voice detaind the headlong tide
forbear ye nations your mad hands forbear
from mutual slaughter peace descends to spare
fear shook the nations at the voice divine
they drop their javelins and their rage resign
all scatterd round their glittering weapons lie
some fall to earth and some confusedly fly
with dreadful shouts ulysses pourd along
swift as an eagle as an eagle strong
but joves red arm the burning thunder aims
before minerva shot the livid flames
blazing they fell and at her feet expired
then stopped the goddess trembled and retired

descended from the gods ulysses cease
offend not jove obey and give the peace

so pallas spoke the mandate from above
the king obeyd the virginseed of jove
in mentors form confirmd the full accord
and willing nations knew their lawful lord
